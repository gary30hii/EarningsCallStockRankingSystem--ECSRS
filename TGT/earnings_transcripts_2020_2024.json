This morning, we're being joined by investors and others who are listening into this webcast. Following today's meeting, Michael and I will be available to answer any follow-up questions. \n Before I turn it over to Brian to kick off the meeting, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases and SEC filings which are posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, let's begin the meeting.\n [Presentation] \nBrian Cornell: Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 Financial Community Meeting. We're eager to share our insights on the extraordinary year that just passed, as well as our vision for what's next. But I couldn't start today without reflecting on the fact that 1 year ago at this time, the pandemic was just beginning to unfold. And in an effort to keep everyone safe and limit travel, we decided to convert this meeting to a virtual format. While we miss hosting our in person gatherings, it's prudent to stick with virtual presentations once again this year. But we're looking forward to resuming our live events, including this one and our Annual Shareholders Meeting in 2022.\n As I look back over the past year, a year when so much care and compassion was called for, I see purpose, coupled with capabilities as the essential enabler of our response. And the story of Target in 2020 is the story of a team that wanted nothing more than to take care of those around us, drawing on capabilities that were equal to that ambition after years of building an investment.  \n So I want to start today by publicly recognizing and thanking our team. I'm incredibly proud of the resilience, empathy, care and concern they've shown for each other, our guests and communities through a very challenging 12 months and counting. None of what we'll share today would've happened without them. Even before the dramatic challenges of last year took hold, our team had been busy building the retail platform of tomorrow. But 2020 accelerated everything and, as such, our guests are already benefiting from and loving that platform today. At the heart of the platform was the belief that consumers would continue to flock to out stores for multicategory one-stop shopping; a friendly, well-trained and knowledgeable team; and joyful experiences.\n As we designed our strategy and invested accordingly, we relentlessly asked ourselves what products and services those stores should offer, where they should be located, how their operations should be tailored to meet neighborhood needs and ultimately, how to make our stores work together with all of our other assets as one shopping platform that would keep guests turning to Target however they want to shop. In answering those questions, we did 2 things at once: We placed the physical store more firmly at the center of our omnichannel platform and we created a durable, sustainable and scalable business model that puts Target on a road of our own.\n Our goal was to use our proximity, nearly 1,900 stores within 10 miles of the vast majority of the U.S. consumers to offer the fastest and easiest digital fulfillment in retail. And the capabilities we built to become America's easiest place to shop also cracked the essential question of how to grow our digital sales exponentially, while maintaining the overall profitability of our business. When we began this journey, we didn't know we would be facing a global pandemic, mass quarantines, rapid unemployment and the need to limit the number of people in public spaces. And yet, when those threats emerged in 2020, we were ready. And without hesitation, millions of American families turned to Target like never before. That happened because of decisions we made 4 and 5 years ago. And today, Christina Hennington, our recently named Chief Growth Officer, along with John Mulligan and Michael Fiddelke, will join me in mapping out how our team's efforts in recent years created a new baseline from which we'll continue to climb higher for our guests.\n And here's what I hope you'll take away from our story. First, that our team's ability to act and react in 2020 was years in the making. Without our multiyear roadmap to develop new capabilities and bring them to scale, 2020 could've exposed essential gaps in our business model. Instead, it proved beyond a doubt the durability of our model and it signaled our potential for continued growth in years ahead.\n The second takeaway stems from a question I've heard frequently, especially in 2020, \"Brian, what's the secret to Target's growth trajectory?\" What you'll see in our presentation today is that the one thing that's driving our success is a focused commitment to several things: an integrated collection of strategies and capabilities that all work together, are very difficult to replicate and, ultimately, make Target unique.\n I'll start today with a high level recap of our full year results. When we gathered virtually for this meeting last year, I shared how our revenue had grown by $5.4 billion since 2017, and that we were consistently gaining share in many of our core merchandising categories. In other words, we were already starting to see steady growth from our investments.\n When we left that meeting, no one knew that COVID-19 would be declared a pandemic in the United States, only a couple of weeks later. In hindsight, it's hard to believe that we only receive one COVID-related question that day. But today, as we look back on 2020, the business highlights are clear: Our revenue during the year increased another $15 billion. We gained meaningful market share across all 5 of our merchandising categories, totaling about $9 billion. Our full year comparable sales were up more than 19%, with a store comp of more than 7% in a year when people were staying home to stay safe, and a digital comp of 145%. Standing at this meeting 3 or 4 years ago, it would have been hard for any of us, or any of you, to imagine digital penetration of 18% without a dramatic deterioration in our P&L. Yet today, we announced record high full year adjusted EPS of $9.42. \n Importantly, we accomplished all of this while making huge incremental investments in our team's safety and well-being and completely reoutfitting our stores to keep our team and guests safe. Far for being a fluke, this performance is further proof that we've built a business model that is working as intended, one that puts Target in a category of its own.  \n A few consistent pillars have been and will continue to be at the heart of our playbook. The enormous investments we made in supply chain, store operations and technology capabilities are already powering exponential growth in digital commerce. They've enabled us to use our stores and showrooms and service centers, but also as hubs for digital fulfillment. Without these investments, we simply wouldn't have been able to satisfy the exploding guest demand for same-day services, represented by more than 600% growth in Drive Up. \n Likewise, Shipt is an extraordinary capability that grew by more than 300% last year and will continue to grow as more guests recognize the power of having their purchases brought to their doorstep in as little as 1 hour. We have consistently invested in our merchandising strength, like our differentiated owned brand portfolio, our curated national brands, inspired limited time offering and strategic relationships that run the gamut from web only start-ups looking for omnichannel scale to premier partners like Disney, Apple, Levi's and Ulta Beauty.\n We're continuously improving our physical and digital shopping experience, investing billions in store remodels, specialized store rows and service training for our teams, while continuing to open up new small formats in urban centers, major college campuses and iconic tourist destinations. Most importantly, we're continuing to invest in our team. Even before 2020's outsized incremental expenditures on team health and safety, Target was an employer of choice, an academy company for those looking for a rewarding and purposeful careers. In addition to accelerating our $15 starting wage in 2020, we celebrated our team's exceptional efforts with 5 separate recognition bonuses, most recently in January when we invested another $200 million to reward each of our frontline team members $500. \n As we develop capabilities, like Target Circle, or acquire them, like Shipt, we do so with a clear vision for how they'll work together in service to our guests. Ultimately, the value they create in our core business has to contribute to our retail offering that's greater than the sum of the parts. But when we look at these elements individually, it's strikingly clear how much value we've added in a very short time. In 2016, our digital transformation was only beginning, we weren't even a top 10 e-commerce provider, and we were just getting our same-day services off the ground. Today, we have the most complete suite of same-day fulfillment services in the industry. We're one of the leading e-commerce players. And for Click and Collect same-day services, we continue to deliver industry-leading growth and dollar volume as well as Net Promoter Scores over 80% despite record demand.\n In 2016, we had about 30 small format stores. Today, we have 140 and we'll add another 30 to 40 per year over the next several years. If these stores were standalone chain, they're revenue would rival that of fast-growing chains with many more locations. In 2016, we launched Pillowfort and Cat & Jack, touching off our owned brand reinvention that has since resulted in more than 30 new brands, with more on the way this year. By the time we gathered for this meeting last year, Cat & Jack and 5 other owned brands were generating $1 billion or more apiece in annual sales, and that tally has continued to grow.\n We cleared 2020 with 10 of owned brands each generating $1 billion or more and 4 of those across the $2 billion per year threshold. Any one of these brands alone would be a sizable retailer and, as you know, their contribution profits is outsized. Of course, owned and exclusive brands are just one component of our merchandising strategy, which is always run on curated national brands across our assortment.\n As we've expanded capabilities in recent years, we've also steadily built our roster of strategic partners. Levi's is an excellent example of how we can build upon a longstanding collaboration and help strategic partners catapult into new product categories. We started partnering with Levi's years ago on the DENIZEN denim brand and that partnership grew to include Levi's Red Tab apparel and build out presence in hundreds of stores and on target.com. Just this last Sunday, we launched the Levi's for Target collection, a limited time offering of home goods. This is the first foray by Levi's into this category and it's a great example of combining their strengths with ours, including our incredible sourcing and product design and development capabilities to forge new potential for both of our brands.\n Meanwhile, our team is also gearing up to introduce Ulta Beauty at Target to our stores and target.com, starting with the first 100 stores later this year. From this initial batch, we'll test, we'll learn and we'll expand hundreds of additional locations over time. This partnership combines Ulta Beauty's unparalleled assortment, category expertise and guest loyalty with our large high-growth traffic-driving beauty business and the ease and convenience of our fulfillment services. Together, we'll be able to offer guests access to established, emerging and prestige beauty brands as well as expert beauty consultation in an industry leading omnichannel retail experience.\n As a standalone or isolated innovation, each of these elements I mentioned, has something in common with the other. Each was advanced based on how it would complement out other assets and capabilities and we tested each one with an eye towards scale. In fact, the ability to integrate and scale is a key component of our decision making. And to emphasize the critical importance of scalability, I simply think back to what we could've done in 2016 but didn't. At that time, conventional wisdom held that the only way forward was for retailers to build capacity, to send more packages to homes. Instead, we went our own way, built a fulfillment model with our guest local store at the center and took the initiative on same-day. We could just as easily have constructed additional fulfillment centers and driven the shift to digital sales with more ship-to-home capacity. But as you know, the economics were terrible and we wouldn't have been differentiated.\n In short, we didn't see the textbook solution as scalable or as likely to do what we've done, namely set the groundwork for years of guest satisfaction and brand loyalty, as represented by comments like this, \"Thank you for providing curbside pickup. It actually was the determining factor in me buying from Target instead of one of those online retailers.\" Or this, or this or this note from a guest who simply said, \"Please always continue to do curbside pick up. It is such a help even outside of COVID. This is a wonderful service and I'll continue to choose Target for this very reason.\"\n So where do we go from here? And how do we keep climbing from this strong new baseline? In the near term, we'll continue to generate incredible value by executing on our strategy. Throughout the pandemic, we've built deep trust and loyalty with our guests who clearly prefer the ease and everyday inspiration of shopping at Target, along with our relentless commitment to the safety and cleanliness of our shopping environment. This is a decades long commitment that was only emphasized by the pandemic, and it will continue to be a differentiator in the months and years ahead.\n Our multi-category merchandise portfolio is a huge advantage, particularly as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. And we're absolutely committed to delivering value and everyday affordability, which is important in any environment, but particularly as the economic consequences of COVID continue to play out. At the same time, we'll continue to listen closely to our stakeholders and to build upon our strategy. So in the years ahead, you'll see continuous iteration and improvement in the pillars I've mentioned already. But we'll also focus on better localizing our experience, applying learning from our small format expansion. And we'll continue to build scale and personalizing the experience, leveraging capabilities like Target Circle to better understand our guests and find new ways to engage and reward the 90 million members who have joined so far.\n To ensure we're continuously delivering great value and emphasizing everyday affordability, we'll stay laser focused on being priced right daily. And on showcasing our value with clear messaging and relevant promotions. Importantly, we'll also double down on an approach to sustainability that builds on our rich legacy and company purpose. This includes decades of community relations, corporate responsibility and philanthropic leadership grounded in our 75-year track record of giving 5% of pre-tax profits in the support of vibrant and inclusive communities. \n Our intent is to further use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet, building on the work we've done already to elevate our offering of sustainable brands, to create equity and opportunity in our communities and to help protect the environment. High stakeholder expectations for corporate responsibility only increased in the pandemic and the 2020 demonstrations for social justice. And as we've seen for years, sustainability builds resiliency in our operating model and fuels growth and innovation. So this is work that's important, not just to our guests, our team members, our investors and our communities but to ensuring our business model remains durable for years to come.\n The best predictor of whether we can follow through on our aspiration is a track record of taking care of our team, serving our guests and communities and responsibly growing our business. And to give you a more detailed picture of how we'll continue to do that in the years ahead, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to weigh in. Christina? \nChristina Hennington: Thanks, Brian. It's great to be joining all of you today, and I'm really excited to discuss how our teams have differentiated Target in the marketplace and some of the potential we see in front of us. Now I should mention upfront that I joined Target back in 2003. Since then, I've held a number of roles across merchandising. Over that time, I've seen a lot in our business, ups and downs, good years and rebuilding years, economic booms and a great recession. But I've never seen anything like last year. Of course, COVID-19 is an unprecedented event, challenging our team and our guests in ways we never could have imagined. But how we responded at Target, empowering our teams, moving quickly and leveraging the power of our multi-category assortment, that's Target at its best. In fact, that's Target better than I've ever seen us. \n So when I think about my new role in bringing together insight, strategy and innovation, plus planning, design, sourcing and buying functions, it's not about fixing anything, it's about improving on what worked so well last year. It's about keeping Target relevant by staying ahead of what our guests need and it's about positioning Target to drive growth in 2021 and for years to come. We were successful last year because we gave our guests a lot of reasons to be confident in shopping at Target. The work of our frontline teams to keep our stores safe and clean has made Target a destination, a happy place as our guests limit other trips out of their homes. \n Our suite of same-day fulfillment options was a game changer, driving triple-digit growth in our digital sales. And regardless of whether our guests were strolling our aisles or scrolling on our app, we struck that balance between replenishment and discovery. Through the breadth of our assortment, along with a single view of inventory and teams leading across all channels, we were able to move with speed and agility, meeting guest needs despite the fastest changing environment we've ever faced. \n A lot of you probably saw this last spring in observing our business or in your own lives. In the space of just a few weeks at the outbreak of the pandemic, guests stocked up on food, beverages and essentials. Then they turned to us for help in converting kitchen tables into classroom space and spare bedrooms into home offices. And then they look to Target for fitness gear, games and other entertainment as they settled in for the long haul. That kind of volatility continued throughout 2020. In fact, one of the only constants last year was that no matter what happened, our guests turned to Target for help to meet functional needs to get through the pandemic and for inspiration and joy, especially around those key seasonal moments that took on added importance for so many people last year. \n So we never looked at our business from the perspective of a particular category. Instead, we shaped our business decisions around what was happening in the world. That's something we'll continue to guide us. Because when we focus on what's happening in the lives of our guests, it's obvious what categories we need to flex to keep building on the trust they placed in Target. Our multi-category assortment is a competitive advantage because it keeps Target relevant no matter what. But how we manage that assortment, the premium we place on curation, partnerships and product design and development, that's what differentiates Target. \n Brian touched briefly on our billion and multibillion-dollar owned brands. Our owned brand portfolio, which spans all categories, is vital to the success of our business. It represents about 1/3 of our total sales and even more of our gross margin, which helps to sustain key enterprise investments. And Target's owned brands continue to generate strong growth because of our approach to creating, designing and maintaining these brands. They're not just private labels, they're brands our guests trust, they're brands our guests love. \n A great example of this is in the athleisure space. Even before athleisure became work-from-home apparel, this was a hot category, and it was an area where we had room to raise our game. So early in 2020, we launched All in Motion. And last month, it became a $1 billion brand. That didn't happen by chance. We were able to respond to this trend quickly and build a beloved brand because we invested in co-creating this brand with our guests. Our team talked to 15,000 people, we consulted with 65 fitness pros and we had team members attend dozens of workout classes with our guests. That's the kind of work we put into owned brands across our assortment in every category. So whether it's sweating through a spin class or talking to parents and kids about how Cat & Jack can meet their needs or taste testing every recipe in our Good & Gather assortment before we launch, we go the extra mile, resulting in brands our guests don't just buy because we offer them at a good price, but instead, brands they love, brands that are the reason why they're shopping at Target in the first place. \n And that work continues. This year, we'll announce and launch several new owned brands in areas where we know Target can make a difference for our guests. This focus on making Target irresistible through our products and our experience also applies to how we work with our national brand partners. And it's an approach that has made targeted place where national brands thrive. You've heard about Levi's, including the limited time Home Collection that just set and the Ulta Beauty at Target shops we're adding to our stores and target.com this year. Those are great examples of what Target represents for our partners. Levi's is an iconic brand that, for a long time, have thrived largely in department store environments. But as they began exploring new platforms, they turned to Target. And Ulta Beauty is an incredible leader in specialty beauty. Through our new partnership, we'll provide access to brands we know our guests love, but previously had to go elsewhere to get. \n This kind of work is a big part of what makes Target special, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, in fact, we began rolling out a dedicated Apple experience, starting in 17 stores across the country and online. We're doubling the Apple footprint in these stores with new lighting fixtures and displays for Apple products, including an extended assortment of accessories. We have a new dedicated Apple landing page on our digital channels and we'll offer our guests more expertise with Apple train team members in these stores and enhanced product videos on our app and website. This is really exciting because we're taking the work we've done with Apple over the last 15 years and making it even better. \n Finally, I want to touch on a body of work that's incredibly important. The efforts underway to make Target more relevant and more welcoming for black guests. Over the last few years, we've listened carefully to our multicultural guests as a whole, and we recognized there was an opportunity to do more for black guests. So we've added more brands and products that we know they love. A great example is what we've done in the beauty space with 50 black-owned and black-founded brands now available in our industry-leading assortment. But we're committed to doing even more in key categories through our owned brands and partnerships, building on our progress to ensure that we're delivering on our purpose of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. \n The retail landscape is never static. So the retailers that will win are the ones that have a durable business model, something we've built at Target. But just as important, the retailers that will be best positioned for the future are the ones with the closest connection to their customers and the ability to flex to meet their changing needs. That was critical to Target's success last year. And that obsession with listening to our guests, understanding the things that are shaping their world and meeting their needs for convenience and ease, inspiration and discovery across all channels is what has Target poised for continued growth in the years ahead. \n Thank you. And now I'll hand the meeting over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. While most people expect the operations guy to get right into the technical stuff, like capacity, throughput and automation, and don't worry, I will get there, I'm going to start with our people, the Target team. In a year when the flexibility and scalability of our operation was pressure tested, our team rose to the challenge, just like they always do. They were the connection between processes, technology and physical assets, that allow us to deliver safety, ease, reliability and even a bit of joy during a year of uncertainty for our guests. Of course, the team wasn't starting from scratch. As you heard already this morning, we've been investing in them for years and building capabilities that would set them up to better serve our guests in any time, let alone a global pandemic. \n Let me take you back for a minute to one of our favorite reference points. It was early 2016 and Target's strategy was coming into focus. After years of testing and listening to our guests, we knew that betting on our stores, an uncommon proposition at the time, would be at the heart of a durable and scalable model. And we needed an operation with the right capabilities to drive it. Getting there wouldn't be fast or easy. Quarter-after-quarter, we tested, iterated and learned how to modernize our supply chain, update our stores, use them as fulfillment hubs and train our team to bring every part to life. Then we had to learn how to do it at scale.\n In 2019, all these efforts started operating together, and we saw tangible proof through financial results, market share gains and guest satisfaction scores that our work was paying off. Fast forward to 2020, we were ready for the world to change. But only because of the years we'd spent laying the operational foundation. The story of how we navigated the twists and turns of 2020 starts with replenishment because the whole operation relies on getting the right product to the right place at the right time. This last quarter, 95% of all sales, online and in person were fulfilled by our stores, which is why it's critical they have enough of the inventory our guests want to buy. Without that piece, the operation simply stops. When the pandemic hit last spring, our guest shopping behaviors changed nearly overnight. We saw heavy stock up trips, huge in-store surges and then a quick shift to online shopping. To meet the needs of the guests, our supply chain had to turn on a dime.  \n We sent hundreds more deliveries than we planned every day to replenish stores fast and often. Flexibility we'd learned from opening dozens of small format stores. We prioritize the flow of essential inventory like paper towels and cleaning wipes, to quickly send stores more of what they needed, not just what was planned. As we sold every paper product we had last March, we expedited everything we could from our vendor partners and secured greater allocations of additional inventory as they ramped up to produce more.\n In a normal year, we just spent months preparing for the traditional Q4 shopping spike. But in 2020, our peak season started in March. And after months of moving record volume, we have become increasingly efficient in how we managed high levels of demand. So when the holidays actually did arrive, we leaned into what was already working. We sent more inventory to stores than ever to prepare for an earlier holiday rush. We front-loaded those deliveries with the seasonal merchandise guests would expect so our stores would be stocked and ready, and we continue prioritizing essential products, like cleaning supplies and health care items, so we could keep meeting the pressing needs of our guests.\n The flexibility of our supply chain set up our stores to play an essential role in our communities. Because we could restock shelves quickly, guests could count on Target for what they needed, whether they came inside or shopped online. And when our digital business picked up last spring, our fulfillment operation went into high gear. Up to that point, our same-day fulfillment services had already been rolled out nationwide. Millions of guests were loving them because they're fast and easy. We always love them because they're incredibly efficient. Without the shipping expense, these orders look much more like a store sale than a traditional online transaction, costing on average 90% less than if we'd shipped it from a warehouse. And at the start of 2020, our same-day sales were growing at a healthy clip. Come spring, when consumers saw the need for more contactless ways to shop, those services exploded. And we had the infrastructure in place to grow alongside demand. \n Brian gave you the full year highlights on Drive Up, up more than 600%, and even Order Pick Up, which has been around for years, still grew more than 70%.  Beyond our pickup options, the delivery capability we have in Shipt became even more important. It filled the need for guests who wanted an online order, especially for perishable items, but also for so many other essentials across Target, brought right to their front doors. It offered more personalization, reliability and speed than they could get from a packaged shipment. And as a result Shipt's target sales grew more than 300%. Of course, we continue to ship online orders from the back of our local stores, saving 40% of the cost of shipping from a warehouse, an economic advantage for us as digital sales now account for even more of our total revenue.\n With third-party carriers fielding historic levels of volume, we worked closely with our partners to plan for capacity constraints and send millions and millions of packages to guest store's steps. But the popularity of our same-day services gave guests another option to shop from home, yet receive their orders faster, reliably and on their own time. Guests had Shipt deliver when it matched their schedule instead of guessing when a shipment would arrive. They drove through our pickup lanes when they were already out and about. No appointment required. This gave guests a flexibility they couldn't find anywhere else. The extraordinary growth of those services has shown just how much guests value that convenience, speed and peace of mind and the comfort they find in having a contactless option.\n In fact, we found that what we built to make Target the easiest place to shop had also set us up to be one of the safest. I've said countless times that a benefit of using our stores as hubs is our ability to ramp-up in peak times and ramp back down based on demand. This last year, the stores ramped up and stayed there. In early spring, our stores were fulfilling more in a single day than they had an entire week the year before, day after day after day. At the same time, they were also continuing to support a safe and easy in-store experience, which also drove strong comps. As our digital business continued to pick up steam, our stores sustained that pace for months on end. Records were set and then broken again and again and again.  \n But the years we spent building a rock-solid fulfillment capability in our stores prepared us to handle waves of volume without sacrificing the guest experience. Stores knew how to staff for peaks, train other store team members to pitch in when things got busy and adjust storage space to hold more orders. Despite wild growth, our Net Promoter Scores that represent guest satisfaction stayed incredibly high. It's one thing for our teams to adjust to record volume, but it's even more impressive to do it while we enhance the services themselves. As digital demand surged, we simultaneously broadened the assortment to make even more of the store available for same-day fulfillment. We added apparel to Shipt's delivery offerings and tested adult beverage pickup in a handful of markets. Most notably, we added fresh and frozen grocery to Drive Up and Order Pick Up. Although this expansion was already in the plan, we accelerated the rollout to go nationwide this summer, offering even more guests essential groceries through our contactless services. \n Importantly, we also adjusted the process to make our services even safer and more efficient. With Drive Up and Order Pick Up, guests now display a PIN on their phones from a distance or through a car window so teams can securely deliver the right order while staying farther apart. We gave additional store team members back up training and fulfillment. For example, when we temporarily closed our Starbucks caf\u00e9s, we taught hundreds of baristas how to efficiently pick and pack an order. That allowed us to keep those team members on the schedule and build their skills, while also helping us manage high volumes during peak times. And we added thousands of Drive Up parking spots, so guests could get in and out even faster.\n At the same time, Shipt more than doubled its shopper network to increase the number of delivery windows it could offer to keep up with soaring demand. It's worth taking a minute to emphasize that using our stores to support digital demand is only possible because of the trust and collaboration across many teams at Target. It's not just a stores operation or a supply chain effort, it's the product of many teams strategizing around a common purpose to deliver for our guests. That one team mindset is what built the capabilities we have today and is what allowed us to adjust swiftly when the business accelerated unexpectedly. \n We built an operation to handle the healthy digital growth we expected through the middle of this decade. The only surprise was that we got there last year much sooner than planned. Although we designed for that kind of flexibility and scale in the long run, our team hadn't planned for it to come all at once, and that's what makes their outstanding execution with no advanced warning, all the more remarkable. Advancing the business several years in a matter of months prove that our model is scalable and also prove we have the capacity to grow.  \n I'd remind you of what I've shared in several of our past earnings calls. A reliable way to assess our stores throughput capacity is to look at the sales we do per square foot. And you can see that productivity has grown a lot over the last couple of years for our average stores, but also for our top quartile. The fact that we continue to see more throughput in our highest-performing stores shows the capacity we have across the rest of the chain for even more growth in the future.\n With all the expectations we have for our stores, the physical buildings themselves play a huge role in our strategy. We're as committed as ever to our years long initiative to remodel stores with an inspirational specialty store feel that makes shopping easy and convenient. At the beginning of last year, we'd started about 130 full store remodels. In mid-March, to reduce distractions in our stores, we decided to complete the projects we'd started. Then we pivoted to more targeted improvements that emphasize safety, like installing plexiglass dividers and reformatting our sales floor for greater distancing.\n The timing for our small-format stores also shifted. After pausing construction in the spring, our teams accelerated the work through the summer and fall to finalize more than 2 dozen stores for new local guests. Despite stopping the work for part of the year, we still opened 29 small format stores, the most completed in 1 year-to-date. From the Las Vegas Strip to UC San Diego, our first store right on campus property, we tapped into new communities. And we continued expanding across markets like New York and L.A. With each one, Target brought a safe and essential shopping experience to even more guests, while positioning us to serve those neighborhoods for years to come.\n Our construction and store design teams also adjusted following the demonstrations for racial justice this summer. One of our Minneapolis stores required an entire rebuild. Without it, the local community had nowhere nearby to get essentials like baby formula and fresh food. So we partnered with local nonprofits to distribute needed supplies while putting plans in motion to reopen fast. We leaned on the expertise we developed remodeling stores and opening small formats to meet the community's needs. We listened to nearby residents, worked with local contractors, personalized the in-store experience and reopened months later as a convenient shopping destination, but also as a better partner to the neighborhood. Take a look.  \n [Presentation] \nJohn Mulligan: From that video alone, it's clear that our team is dedicated, tireless and incredibly compassionate when it comes to serving our communities. You saw it in the opening video and you've heard it throughout this morning. Our team is the heartbeat of Target. And even when faced with challenges, they bring their A game. \n Several years ago, we implemented a new operating model in our stores to lift up that drive. It was a shift towards specialized roles to give our teams expertise, empowerment and a sense of ownership in how they serve our guests. With that model in place, our team could quickly adapt to the ups and downs in 2020, execute well and play an essential role in our communities. Now like anything in life, balance is good, and we found opportunities to train our specialists in other areas like teaching a hardlines expert how to fulfill an online order. So they gain skills beyond their specialized position. Those investments in their development also add flexibility to our operation.\n We've always known that supporting our team would have great returns and it has. In addition to the bonuses, time off options, wellbeing benefits and expanded nationwide starting wage that Brian mentioned, we also gave our team even more hours. With a greater investment in our trained and expert workforce, we saw turnover drop and guest satisfaction rise. It's a strong testament to what can be done when we empower our teams to use their skills and passions to serve our guests. The bottom line is that as our business grew exponentially, our operation flexed alongside. And as we delivered for our guests, we built on the trust they put in us to meet their needs and make it easy.  \n Going forward, we're taking the capabilities that drove Target in 2020 and accelerating them to continue making Target, the safest and easiest place to shop. As we do, we'll invest in more capacity and greater efficiencies. So we're positioned to continue growing for the long term.\n In our supply chain, that starts with expanding our network so we continue to have replenishment capacity that can support our future growth. In recent years, we accommodated steady sales growth through our existing supply chain network by increasing the productivity of our buildings. In fact, the average sales per foot supported by our distribution centers rose nearly 30% between 2016 and 2020, thanks to a series of process and technology improvements. During those years, we didn't open any new DCs to support replenishment. But after our business grew nearly 20% last year, with 95% of sales driven by our stores, it's time to expand our supply chain so we can support a much higher base of sales and continue growing.\n This year, we'll open 2 distribution centers to support replenishment, 1 close to the New Jersey Delaware state line and another in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago. And we currently have plans for one on each coast in 2022. We're also continuing to simplify the unload process once product reaches the stores. In a nutshell, it all comes down to how we sort and organize millions of items before they arrive at the stores' loading dock.  \n We've shown you the robotics capabilities we're building to help us sort inventory to the precise amount of store needs and organize it by store aisle. When we do, replenishment in stores is fast. Team members grab a tote, walk to the aisle and stock the shelf. No sorting in the back room or finding places to stash cases of excess product. We have 2 solutions that help us do that. We showed you both of these independently last year: 1 called auto-rebin sorts individual items. This is most useful for slower moving inventory, when stores only need a handful of items to put back on the shelf. Auto-rebin started in one of our local Minnesota warehouses, rolled out to 2 more and we'll expand to another 2 this year. \n The second is the robotic ships order we've been building at our Perth Amboy facility. This sorts everything, from boxes of individual items to entire cases of product. After the sort, robot sequence inventory so our team can load pallets in an order that saves stores even more time. Individually, these capabilities are hugely valuable, but they're designed to work together. This spring, we'll put both solutions in 1 warehouse to test how they bring more precision and speed to store replenishment. In Q4, we'll run them together at a small scale, doing what we always do to learn and iterate before we go bigger. Opening new warehouses and expanding our robotics capabilities are both about moving product more easily to stores. \n But just as important is being ready to send what stores need before they even know it. This year, we'll continue expanding the rollout of our predictive inventory positioning capability across our assortment. This helps us more precisely order and position product close to where we anticipate guests will want it so we can react quickly when there's demand. In turn, it improves out of stocks and lowers backroom inventory levels. In 2020, when sales spiked, this capability allowed us to order and restock products 25% faster than using our old systems. This year, we'll use it to order and position even more items in our assortment, so we can replenish the majority of the store faster for our guests. \n We've talked about how store replenishment feeds store fulfillment. This past year, our team was able to keep filling online orders because our supply chain was replenishing that inventory with speed and precision. While we continue refining our replenishment operation, we'll also build on our fulfillment capabilities to enhance the guest experience and make way for future growth. Today, the majority of our store assortment is available through our same-day services, but we're continually working to give guests even more choices. In coming months, we'll expand our pickup options further into categories like apparel and fresh food and roll adult beverage pickup to 800 more stores.\n We're also continuing to improve the Target Run so it's even easier for our guests and faster for our team. For example, Drive Up guests will be able to share more preferences in the app, like telling the team where to place the order in their vehicle or signing an alternate pickup person so it's easier for a spouse or family member to pick it up. We're numbering our Drive Up spaces so our teams can find guests sooner for those times when a guest pulls up in a black SUV next to 8 other black SUVs. And we're updating the team member app, so they can more easily see what orders are in progress and where they can help.\n Our same-day services have grown faster than any other fulfillment method. But when we do ship online orders, we'll continue sending the majority of those packages out the back of our stores. Since 2016, we scaled our ship-from-store capability from a low tech test in a few hundred stores to a sophisticated fulfillment operation in most Target backrooms. Now before anyone gets too worked up, I don't mean we have robots hiding in the back. Instead, we've got efficient tools, technology and process design working together, continually increasing the number of orders a store can fulfill.\n Next, we'll take it a step further, developing last mile capabilities that help us continue scaling this operation so we can ship more orders from stores on even lower cost. To do it, we're testing a new type of facility here in Minneapolis called a sortation center. The idea is to make our stores' hub model even more efficient, while also reducing our load on external carriers. Take a look.  \n [Presentation] \nJohn Mulligan: This capability frees up time and space in our stores, which we can redirect into fulfilling more orders. In the end, it allows us to get orders to guests faster and at a lower cost. While we're still ramping up production at this first test facility, we're very confident in this concept and plan to open 5 additional sites in other urban markets later this year.\n In 2021, we'll also open more stores, accelerating our growth with 30 to 40 new locations a year, a pace we'll keep up for the foreseeable future. With our small format strategy, we'll expand in urban markets like Portland, L.A. and New York City, where there are still opportunities to serve new guests. And we'll continue our focus on college stores with the University of Georgia and the University of Michigan planned for later this year. We remain extremely bullish on our college sites. Even as the pandemic sent students to online classrooms and sales softened at many of those stores, we see them as a long-term play to serve the college guests, many of whom are on the brink of adulthood and building lifelong shopping habits.\n We'll also open a number of midsized stores to serve dense suburban neighborhoods from Denver to Brooklyn. As hundreds of retail vacancies have left holes in communities across the country, we've committed to sites where we can fill a need for the local guests. And as retail real estate prices have declined this year, we found these opportunities to serve new communities to be even more affordable. Along with opening new stores, we'll get back to remodeling our existing fleet. After stopping our full store remodels last spring, we'll pick back up later this year and complete about 150 stores in time for holiday, and we'll plan to ramp up to more than 200 stores a year in 2022 and beyond. \n Safety and ease have become the heart of Target shopping experience, and we'll incorporate what we learned during 2020 into our future store design. That includes implementing more contactless features, from our restrooms to our checkouts and adding distance between merchandise and at the check lanes. And as you heard from Christina, we'll also bring brand partnerships to life in our stores throughout 2021. A great example is the work we'll do to add Ulta Beauty to our sales floor, creating a specialty environment that's seamlessly integrated into the Target experience. Similarly, we'll use store design elements to highlight additional brands like Disney and Apple for our guests. \n We're investing in a lot of really exciting developments to fuel Target's growth. But what they all have in common, they're giving our team the tools or the backdrop to take better care of our guests and each other. That shows up most in our stores where the vast majority of our 350,000 team members bring our brand to life for guests across the country. A huge priority for our stores this year is adjusting our staffing strategies to create more predictability for our team. That's a challenge in any retail job, where ours are based on dynamic factors like consumer shopping patterns and changing team needs. But we know having an engaged team with more consistent hours leads to higher productivity, greater efficiency and lower turnover. It creates a place where people join to learn a job and stay to build a career and better serve our guests in the long run. So we'll train team members to take on other roles across the store and offer the option for longer shifts.\n We'll also build on our stores' operating model by introducing a new standard of service to our teams. It's not a checklist, but a set of principles that define great service, like welcoming a guest and paying attention to what they need, which might be as simple as finding an item or as big as building an outfit. It's meant to give our team flexibility and empower them to do what's right for the guests in the moment. Without our team, everything else you heard today comes to a standstill. The Target team continues to be the most important part of our operation, and I want to say an enormous thank you to all our team members for all they do to serve our guests and our communities.\n You've seen us make a lot of operational investments over the last few years, in our team, in our stores and in our capacity for long-term growth. In the most recent quarter, those returns were clear. We've created an operation unlike anyone else with our physical assets working together, centered on our stores and fueled by our team to serve our guests and grow for the long term. The capabilities we built not only allowed us to navigate the most volatile time in retail history but show that they can flex and grow to serve the ever-changing needs of the consumer. The work isn't done. We're constantly refining an operation that is efficient, fast and supportive of Target's durable and scalable business model. From an engineer by training and a finance guy at heart, I can attest that you can't get too efficient or relevant enough. There's no finish line for continuous improvement and innovation. We'll keep making bets on the capabilities that give us the flexibility to serve guests well into the future.\n We have a lot of strength heading into 2021 and a lot of work still in front of us. But with a sound operational foundation and the talent and resilience of the Target team driving us ahead, I look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters and years to come.  \n With that, Michael, I'll hand it over to you. \n [Presentation] \nMichael Fiddelke: All I can say is wow. Those news clips paint a vivid picture of the roller coaster our team and our business experienced throughout 2020. All in all, it was a standout year in which everything we've spent years developing and building came together to serve our guests like never before. \n So today, after a year of record growth, I want to start my remarks by expanding on a point Brian mentioned earlier because investors often want to know, how much of Target's growth is being driven by specific strategies or specific assets? For example, they want to know if we can isolate how much of our growth is coming from Drive Up, from digital and total, our owned brand work, remodel program and any other way we can slice and dice the data. And I understand the impulse. Our internal team often wants to do the same thing. And of course, as a self described data geek, I'm inclined to think the same way.\n But then I see data like we first shared with you last year. Guests who tried Drive Up for the first time spend about 30% more on average compared with before, including an increase in conventional store shopping. And we see a similar change in behavior among guests who try Shipt for the first time. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of Drive Up and Shipt go far beyond the value of an individual trip. They're both capabilities that drive guest affinity, creating value that extends well beyond the services themselves.\n That same thinking applies to our merchandise categories. If you focus only on the amount of sales or growth by category, you can miss how they all work together to drive guest affinity. I see how this plays out with my own family. Over the next few months, the cold weather in Minnesota will finally end, and my kids will need warm weather clothes. On the next Saturday morning Target run, we'll shop for those clothes, and we'll also pick up some food, a few office supplies, laundry detergent and maybe a prescription from CVS. We might wander over and purchase some spring decor. And we'll probably need some more earbuds since the kids seem to be inventing new ways to lose or destroy them. And on our way out, we'll probably stop at the Starbucks near the entrance so my wife and I can enjoy a coffee on the way home. \n So now if you're going to analyze that basket, is there a way to know which category drove the trip? And beyond the basket itself, shouldn't we broaden the analysis even further since that trip depended on a conveniently located store that's clean, safe and fun to shop, featuring low everyday prices and a friendly and engaged team?\n Over time, I've come to understand that guest engagement and financial performance are driven by everything we're doing at the same time, not any factor in isolation. Among the critical factors, of course, there are the tangible assets that show up on our balance sheet, including our stores, distribution centers and technology, but the list goes way beyond the balance sheet and includes our team, our reputation and the trust we've established with multiple stakeholders, which only deepened in 2020. Then there's the Target brand itself. Our owned and exclusive brands, capabilities like marketing, merchandising, product design and development, sourcing and so much more. And of course, there's our culture, our mission and our values, which helped to unify a diverse and widely dispersed team in support of a common purpose. \n So what's the key to our future performance? It's our continued investments in the assets and capabilities, both tangible and intangible, that we can build and integrate to drive guest engagement and growth. And how should we determine what to focus on? The answer comes from continually listening carefully to our guests. The better we know them, the more effectively we can invest in what they want and develop new ways to deliver joy and inspiration while making their lives easier. If we invest the right way, guests will reward us with more engagement and growth, which in turn will create additional opportunities to invest.  \n Our success in 2020, which was years in the making, is a perfect example. It started many years ago as we engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of our business, our strategy and took a deep dive into the wants and needs of our guests. That work led to a new strategic focus, followed by years of investment of both capital and expense to roll out new fulfillment capabilities, rejuvenated stores and brands, a modern store operating model and more. Through that work, we built the foundation that allowed our team to deliver unprecedented results in the face of a rapidly changing landscape in 2020.  \n So this year, our focus is to lock in last year's gains, build on that foundation, continue to deepen guest engagement and drive long-term growth. And following last year's growth of $15 billion, more than we grew over the prior 11 years combined, we're entering 2021 as a much larger company with a host of opportunities to build on last year's success.  \n Digital is one of those opportunities. As John mentioned, in 2020, the penetration of digital sales advanced many years in a single year. With COVID as the catalyst, guests who had never tried our digital services quickly changed their habits and tried them sooner than they would have otherwise. We've long told you that, on average, a multichannel guest spends nearly 4x as much as a store-only guest and nearly 10x more than a digital-only guest. Now just in case there are any stats majors listening, that's a statement about correlation, not causation. So I'm not saying that a guest spending immediately changes that much after they move into a new channel. \n Even so, these averages help us to understand how deepening engagement translates to a more valuable guest relationship. And last year, Target gained an additional 12 million multichannel guests. Of course, a portion of those guests were completely new to Target, but the vast majority had previously shopped with us, but only in a single channel. The opportunity this year is to build on our now deeper relationship with these guests as we engage with them more frequently and help them migrate toward the much higher average spend we see from our multichannel guests over time.\n And today, even though we already have an unmatched suite of digital fulfillment options, there's more we can do for our guests. One way is to continue expanding the assortment of fresh, refrigerated and frozen food items available for Pick Up and Drive Up. When we study the behavior of guests who first shopped for these items through one of these services last year, we saw an average increase in shopping frequency of about 1 visit per month compared with the control group. On average, these guests increase their food and beverage spending between 20% and 30%. And importantly, spend about 20% more in other categories. \n As you heard from Christina, we also have an opportunity to continue developing and launching new owned brands while we become an increasingly attractive partner for leading national brands. In the years ahead, we'll likely have many more partnership opportunities. And given our strong performance and financial position, can be very thoughtful in approaching every one of them. This begins by ensuring the partnership is right for our guests and that the partner and financial arrangement are appropriate long-term choices for our business. \n And of course, there's a huge opportunity to create value through Target Circle, which has grown in less than 2 years to include more than 90 million members. Circle is easy and free to join and members enjoy rewards that drive engagement directly, which we can measure by the increase in spending among guests who joined. But the value of Circle only begins there because it also helps us to gain an ongoing, deeper understanding of our guests and their changing preferences, helping us to connect them with the services, brands and categories that address those wants and needs.\n So it's clear that we're entering 2021 with a lot of momentum and a really strong foundation with a lot more room to grow. As you heard from John, we still have a long runway to expand the available assortment for our same-day services, while we invest to broaden Shipt's reach by entering new markets while expanding in existing ones. When we acquired Shipt in late 2017, we were confident that same-day delivery was a capability every successful retailer would need to have, and we've spent the last 3 years integrating Shipt into our strategy and operations. At the same time, the acquisition has made it easier for Shipt to grow and achieve scale in new markets, given the volume that Target immediately brings to the platform. \n And as John covered, we're investing to modernize our network and add replenishment capacity to support future growth. Obviously, we came into last year with a great deal of capacity, but we used up a lot more of it than expected. Here's one way to think about it. At our current average sales per store, last year's growth of $15 billion was equivalent to the addition of more than 300 new Target stores. If we had actually opened that many new locations, we'd have needed some additional upstream capacity, and that need is the same, whether growth is coming from a bigger store footprint or higher productivity in our existing footage.\n While I'm on the topic, I want to pause and address the question of whether our stores are going to run out of capacity to grow digital sales. And I'd start with what John mentioned earlier, how our top quartile of stores demonstrate the continued potential for our average stores to handle more throughput. But I want to drill down into a really specific example to provide another view of our untapped capacity. And what we can do when an individual location reaches its limit. To do that, I'm going to go way back in history and talk about our experience at the Target store in Colma, California, part of the San Francisco market.  \n 20 years ago, Colma had grown to be our second highest volume store in the chain, generating more than $90 million in annual sales, nearly 3x our chain average at the time. Given its extreme volume, we suspected the store was running out of capacity, which was limiting its ability to grow. So when the site of a former Montgomery Ward's became available just across the highway in Daly City, we decided to buy it and build a new Target. This was unheard of in our history, building a new store less than a mile away from an existing one, and it was a calculated risk because the new store would only make sense if it drove incremental volume. And that's exactly what happened. The combined sales of the 2 stores quickly grew far beyond what the single store was able to generate. And today, each of those locations is in the top 5% of our stores based on sales volume.\n So let's come back to today. Last year, our stores fulfilled more than 95% of our total sales, which works out to an average of about $47 million in fulfilled sales per store. That means our average store today is fulfilling about half of what the Colma store was already supporting 20 years ago. This offers another clear window into the growth potential of our average store today. But will there sometimes be extreme examples of stores that hit their capacity? I hope so because we know what to do when that happens. If we have a viable real estate opportunity nearby, we can invest in another one of these modern multichannel assets we happen to call a Target store. To be clear, based on what we see today, we don't expect a lot of these opportunities over the next few years, but I'd love to be wrong about that since we'd likely generate strong returns on the new stores we could open in those markets. In the meantime, we continue to make productive investments in new small format stores, and we're eager to begin ramping up our remodel program in 2021 and beyond. \n So with all these options to generate profitable growth, we're in a position to play offense and lean into the opportunity to build on last year's momentum. As such, we're planning for annual CapEx in the $4 billion range in each of the next few years to support remodels, new stores and supply chain projects to add replenishment capacity and modernize the network, including sortation centers. Beyond full store remodels, we'll also invest in Ulta Beauty shop in shops, while optimizing front end space in our highest volume locations, increasing the efficiency of our Pick Up and Drive Up services.\n So now this is the section of my remarks in which you typically expect me to cover our P&L expectations for the year. But today, given the high level of uncertainty we continue to face, providing a lot of guidance would be an exercise on false precision. Instead, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the most important factors affecting our near-term plans as we maintain our laser focus on investing for the long term.\n So first, as I think about implications for Target's top line in the months and years ahead, I think about the drivers at 3 levels of a funnel. At the widest part of the funnel are macro factors, including uncertainty about the path of COVID-19 and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine campaign. How consumer attitudes and behaviors will evolve as we emerge from the pandemic. For example, there's an emerging consensus that the nature of work will permanently change as employers move to a more flexible model and allow for more work from home. This will likely have long-lasting implications for consumer spending. And finally, beyond changes in the consumer mindset, macro considerations include the health of the economy, the near-term impact of stimulus and how quickly various industries and communities will recover from the pandemic. \n The middle stage of the funnel involves questions around potential industry trends in each of the categories we sell and every industry has its own story. And categories consumed mostly at home, including food and beverage, essentials, home and hardlines, industry trends have accelerated over the last year and could see some softness as we emerge from the crisis. However, the timing and extent is hard to predict and could be offset by permanent changes in consumer habits, including a higher percentage of work time spent at home and an elevated focus on cleanliness and health resulting from the pandemic.\n In the beauty and apparel industries, which experienced softness in 2020, trends are expected to improve over time. Specifically, as people resume working in offices, attending concerts, movies and sporting events, traveling and eating out, they're likely to focus more on their appearance and spend more on these categories than they did in 2020. But let's be clear. These are just quick high-level thoughts on potential industry trends and they're far from ironclad predictions. \n So as we move to the bottom of the funnel and think about how those trends are likely to play out at Target, we first need to think about market share within those industries and on the topic of share, we have a lot of confidence as we look ahead. In 2020, Target saw unprecedented share gains across all 5 of our core merchandise categories. Importantly, these gains were not limited to the categories in which others were forced to close, and they stayed remarkably consistent throughout the year and across the country. Based on this experience and our investment focus going forward, we're optimistic about our opportunity to lock in recent share gains and deliver long-term growth on top of the foundation we've already established.\n So now I want to move beyond the top line and illustrate how we're thinking about other lines on the P&L for the year. And in this discussion, beyond prior year comparisons, I will often be looking back to 2019, since that year provides a more stable baseline compared with the extreme volatility we encountered in 2020. Let's start with our gross margin line, where in 2020, we experienced large but offsetting variances related to specific factors. The first was supply chain and digital fulfillment costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure last year. While that headwind was notable, it was less than I believe most of us would have expected, given that we saw $10 billion of digital sales growth, accounting for 2/3 of our total growth. As we look ahead to this year and beyond, we expect to see a smaller amount of pressure from supply chain and digital fulfillment, given that digital growth is likely to moderate, and we continue to make progress in reducing average unit fulfillment costs. \n A second headwind to last year's gross margin rate was category mix as lower margin categories grew faster than our higher-margin categories, accounting for about 90 basis points of rate pressure. At a minimum this year, we expect category mix to exert less pressure than last year. And notably, it could easily become a tailwind like it was in prior years. However, our crystal ball is not nearly clear enough today to predict this year's category mix with any precision.\n The third factor in last year's gross margin performance was our merchandising decisions, which include our pricing, mix of owned and national brands and the magnitude of our promotional and clearance markdowns. In 2020, the combination of these factors provided a significant tailwind of about 150 basis points, driven primarily by favorability and markdowns. A portion of this favorability was related to promotions, but the biggest single factor was a significant decline in clearance markdown rates as demand in seasonal and other clearance sensitive categories far outpaced our expectations. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from these abnormally low levels, which will create some gross margin pressure compared with 2020. So how do these expectations come together in 2021? As we consider the range of expectations for the combined impact of these 3 drivers, we believe that our 2021 gross margin rate will remain somewhat lower than our 2019 gross margin rate of 28.9%.\n On the SG&A expense line this year, we'll be annualizing last year's significant investments in safety measures and team member pay and benefits. We'll also be annualizing the fixed cost and other scale benefits we realized throughout the year. Looking ahead, given that we're focused on locking in last year's gains, we expect to retain significant scale benefits compared with 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver continued efficiency improvements, driven by investments in our supply chain, technology and operating model, which will help to offset continued investments in our team. Altogether, we expect that our 2021 SG&A expense rate will also be lower than our 2019 rate of 20.8%. \n On the D&A expense line, we expect to see moderate dollar growth in 2021 as we ramp up remodels and accelerate depreciation on the assets we replace. Of course, rate performance will depend on the total sales we deliver this year.  \n So as we consider how all of these rates come together on the operating margin line, we're facing a wide range of possibilities as we enter the year. I've already talked about the unpredictability of sales and how category and channel mix alone can impact our margin. But even with that uncertainty, we should continue to benefit from the leverage we gained in 2020. Altogether, our expectation is that this year's operating margin rate will move down from the 7% we recorded in 2020 but remain above our 2019 operating margin rate of 6%, with the most likely outcome in the lower half of that range. \n So now for those of you hoping we provide a more precise view of our expectations today, I want you to know that I feel the same way. I know that it's difficult to model our business right now. Our team is facing the same challenge. In the face of this uncertainty, we continue to put a huge premium on flexibility and agility, which served us extremely well throughout 2020. After all, flexibility is a cornerstone of our business model, which features a uniquely diverse category mix and a store-based fulfillment model that can quickly adapt to changes in guest shopping patterns. With the benefit of this model, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, we're perfectly positioned to navigate any near term uncertainty, while we continue to invest in long-term growth. And while it may sound counterintuitive, our expectations for the next few quarters feel cloudier than our view of the longer term, when we're highly confident in our ability to grow profitably and build on recent share gains.\n So now before I move beyond the P&L, I want to spend a minute talking about the prior year comparisons we're facing in the first 2 quarters of this year. As you'll recall, in the first quarter last year, sales accelerated meaningfully after the onset of COVID, but our gross margin rate for the quarter declined an astounding amount, more than 4 percentage points in light of the cost to rightsize our apparel inventory.\n Also in the first quarter, we began making meaningful investments in the health and safety of our team and guests, which we'd maintained throughout the year. Altogether, our first quarter earnings per share were down more than 60% compared with 2019. Contrast that with the second quarter last year when our comp sales grew more than 24%, our gross margin rate also increased and we saw a jaw dropping amount of leverage on the SG&A and D&A expense lines, which more than offset investments in team and guest safety. As a result, last year's second quarter EPS grew more than 80% compared with 2019. That's a swing of more than 140 percentage points in our EPS growth rates between Q1 and Q2 last year.\n So as we plan and analyze our performance in the first 2 quarters of 2021, we're going to lean heavily on comparisons to the much more stable environment we experienced in 2019. This will help all of us to look through the extreme volatility and year-over-year comparisons we'll be seeing throughout the first half of this year. \n So now let's move beyond the P&L and turn to cash and capital deployment, and I want to reiterate that our priorities remain the same as they have been for decades. First, we look to invest in the business and all of the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. One note, if we attain that goal in 2021, it will mark our 50th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend increases, putting us in a very small group of companies who can make that statement. And finally, we look to deploy excess cash through share repurchases only after we fully supported the first 2 goals within the capacity of our middle A credit ratings.\n As you know, last year turned out to be a very strong year for cash flow in light of our sales growth and strong operational performance. As a result, we ended the year with about $8.5 billion of cash, well beyond the amount we'd maintain in ordinary times. But as strong as our year turned out to be, we can't forget the volatility we just encountered and the environment today remains far from ordinary. It's in that context that we evaluate our 2021 capital deployment expectations.\n Regarding CapEx, I already outlined our plan to invest about $4 billion this year. Regarding the dividend, later this year, we expect to recommend that our Board approve a robust increase in the per share dividend. But as always, this recommendation will depend on how our business is performing. Beyond those priorities, we've resumed share repurchases this year. And depending on how the virus, the economy and our performance progresses, could have ample capacity within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\n But I will quickly say, we'll continue to be cautious and maintain an ample amount of liquidity to carry us through a wide range of near-term scenarios. As such, it may be a multiyear journey before our credit metrics move fully back to historical levels, depending on the speed with which we see more normal volatility across the economy and our business.\n So now I want to turn to our after-tax ROIC. As we've long emphasized, we rely on this metric to assess the health of our business and the effectiveness of our capital deployment over time. However, as is often the case, we sometimes need to look past near-term volatility and 2020 presents a great example. That's because last year, we delivered an astounding aftertax ROIC of 23.5%, up more than 7 percentage points from already strong performance in 2019. While this outcome is remarkable and a testament to our team and operating model, I'm going to quickly say that it's artificially high and likely to come back down over time. That might sound like a strange thing to say, but it's based on a number of factors that are clear today. \n First, with unexpectedly strong sales, our inventory turns shot up last year, and we saw abnormally high payables leverage. While that had a positive near-term impact on working capital, we also saw really choppy in stocks, which isn't how we want to operate under normal conditions. In 2021, we're planning for full shelves and better in stocks, which will bring inventory turns and payables leverage back down to more sustainable levels. This will require a net investment of working capital for the year. \n Similarly, as I mentioned earlier, we're leaning in to support a strong set of growth opportunities over the next few years. As we accelerate investment in stores, supply chain modernization and replenishment capacity in support of those growth prospects, we'll likely see an increase in the invested capital portion of this metric over the next few years. Bottom line, while I believe this metric will stay very healthy and compare favorably to other retailers, I expect it will move back down into the 20% range over time. This would represent very strong absolute and relative performance on a larger asset base than we've maintained in the past. \n So as I get ready to turn things back over to Brian. I want to take you back to this meeting 4 years ago, when I was listening from my headquarters in Minneapolis. During my career at Target, I've been lucky to spend time working with our stores, and I've developed a deep appreciation for the value they can deliver. So when Brian and John stood up and said we'd be investing to put our stores at the center of everything we do, including both digital and physical shopping, I had a ton of confidence in that plan. It was a plan based on carefully listening to our guests, it was differentiated and we were fortunate to have the necessary resources to get there.\n In the years following that meeting, our team worked hard, and we encountered many doubters but we continued to invest with a long view and last year's results showed the value of that focus. And as we sit here today, we remain committed to making future investments with that same long view. Rather than sitting back, taking a break and waiting for the virus to subside, we are focused on playing offense and investing in continued growth. \n And just like 4 years ago, my confidence in the future starts with the team. So I want to acknowledge everyone on the Target team, from headquarters to our distribution centers, to our stores in all 50 states and our offices around the world for their dedication to our guests and passion for taking care of each other. Without you, we couldn't have delivered such an amazing amount of value on behalf of our stakeholders in 2020. And with your help, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders in the years ahead. I can't say it enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \n Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. As we wind down today's event, I'll leave you with a couple of thoughts. 5 years ago, we envisioned a future for ourselves, in which the key to guest preference and breakout growth lay in an unappreciated omnichannel asset called the store. Many were skeptical, which is why we said from the beginning that we were playing our own game and creating a category of one. Many thought the inevitable drift was for our store guests to become digital guests, and that the current only ran in 1 direction.\n We saw something different. We saw a future in which even the most committed digital-only guests would find the best and easiest shopping experience at Target because of how we connect that experience to our stores. We knew that to make our stores function for the future that we envisioned, we'd have to build, acquire and bundle a unique set of capabilities. The technology, the supply chain inventiveness, the physical assets and operations and the team of trusted neighbors that millions turn to for friendly service and a bit of everyday joy.  \n We began to put all those pieces together like no one else had. And the experience was taking hold, on the timetable we expected. Then 2020 accelerated everything. And today, Target is as synonymous with same-day and safety as it is with style and swagger. That is a very strong position to be in.\n And here's where we intend to go with it. First, we'll continue to focus on market share over the long term. We believe our experience, including our fulfillment options, inspiring assortment, ease, safety and personal service will convert more and more consumers into guests. And we'll also work tirelessly to engage established guests across more of our channels and offerings. With new guests choosing Target and established guests engaging with more of our platform, we'll be able to listen to them even more closely. And capabilities like Drive Up, Shipt and Circle will give us a wider window than ever into their preferences. Meaning, we can further improve the experience we provide in the near term, while continuously anticipating where we should go next.  \n Staying closely connected to our guests always points us in the right direction. That's what helped us see a future 5 years ago, that today is a reality. And it's why we're stepping up our investments to drive additional profitable growth. Unlike in recent years, when we needed to shore up our foundation or create new capabilities, today's investments will build on an omnichannel Target platform that is already working incredibly well. A platform that has raised expectations, not just among Target guests, but for consumers across U.S. retail. Few can meet those expectations like we can because what we've created is based on a unique combination of differentiated assets.  \n But this is just the beginning of our story on which we'll continue to iterate, innovate and continuously improve for our guests. So in closing, I want to express my complete confidence in this company's future. I'm confident in our strategy and in our capabilities. And above all, I'm confident in our team. They know that no platform succeeds without purpose. And that our ambitions are always informed by the millions of families we serve. The results we're sharing today and what we envision for the future simply wouldn't be possible without the best team in the business. And I want to thank them once again for all they do for Target, our guests and communities.\n Finally, I want to thank you for joining our Financial Community Meeting. We appreciate your interest in Target, your engagement in our journey and your long-term investment in a growth horizon that we believe will remain bright for years to come. We look forward to hearing from you in the Q&A portion of our program. \n And I'll turn it back to John Hulbert to move us into that discussion. John? \nJohn Hulbert: Thanks, Brian. Before we take a short break, I want to pause and review logistics for the upcoming Q&A session. For those of you planning to listen in, but not ask a question during Q&A, you should simply stay on this webcast, and you'll hear this session in a few minutes. However, if you received our conference call invitation and you plan to ask a question today, you'll need to exit this webcast and dial into the conference line provided on your invitation. Once you're on the conference line, the operator will provide further instructions. But again, if you're planning to access the Q&A session in listen-only mode, your best option is to stay on this webcast even if you received an invitation.  \n With that, we'll pause for a few minutes to provide ample time for conference call participants to dial in and begin the Q&A session shortly. Thank you.\n [Break] \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation 2021 Financial Community Meeting Q&A Session Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, March 2, 2021. We are now ready for our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: A near - a '21 question, and then I have a follow-up on a longer-term question. Okay, in the SG&A outlook, on our math, you have about $1 billion related to COVID costs, such as special bonuses and cleaning, while you raised to $15 an hour midyear. To what extent are you assuming these costs come -- are tailwinds in '21? And can you quantify how significant the operating expense related -- is related to investment that's pressuring SG&A dollars? \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. I can take that one first, Chris. When you think about [ SG&A ] through the year, we'll be annualizing the move to $15, and there'll be some onetime things that don't repeat. You think about buying plexiglass dividers, you only do that once. The final story in SG&A will be written by what our sales outcome looks like too. But we've got a lot of levers within the model to continue to bend the cost curves in a direction we like throughout SG&A, the benefit of the volume growth that we've seen is that, that helps us get more and more efficient on how we fulfill that volume. \nChristopher Horvers: So then does it mean that sort of the SG&A rate coming back up is more of an embedded sort of negative top line outlook? \nMichael Fiddelke: No, I wouldn't think about it that way necessarily. With the SG&A, we expect that our SG&A rate will be lower than 2019's rate, and that's a benefit of the significant scale that we've gained since then. If you zoom out, I think there's going to be a lot of movement between the different levers within margin and SG&A. And so that's why we've tried to give some of our best thinking on operating rate in total. And so a wide range. Not every meeting I would sit here and be describing a 1 point gap in operating margin between the incredibly strong 6 that we had in 2019 and the 7 we just put up. And that whole range is in play. I think it's slightly more likely we're in the bottom half of that range when all the dust settles in the top half, but we're going to have a lot to learn throughout the year based on where we ultimately land. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then longer-term and bigger picture, we used to talk about showrooming with Best Buy. I was wondering what the organizational's thought change is on showrooming is versus national brands? You launched Apple and now you have Ulta. What's the thought change here? And what does it say about the willingness to take on more national brands in the apparel space where maybe the brands need to replace volumes from the mall? And is the bar higher here in terms of what those brands will need to bring to get into the Target store? \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Chris, it's Brian. I think one of the things that we underscored throughout the pandemic has been the strength of our stores. And despite many of Americans really avoiding public places, we've seen very strong store comps, obviously, in excess of 7%. And we saw very solid store traffic. So I think we've continued to build trust. And I think coming out of the pandemic, our stores are going to be -- continue to be very relevant, very important. I think they go far beyond showcasing. We know our guests are inspired by shopping in our stores. They enjoy browsing. They enjoy seeing the combination of our owned brands and national brands. \n And now I think we just punctuate that further with the addition of brands like Ulta Beauty, Levi's, the expansion of Apple. The work that we've done throughout the year to create a showcase of owned brands and national brands and continue to invest in building a trusted and safe shopping experience. So as we think to the future, stores are going to play a very important role. It's going to be a place where our guests enjoy shopping each and every day. And I think they're going to continue to enjoy our multi-category portfolio for years to come. So we are -- continue to be very bullish on the role stores play. And I think these new national brand partnerships will only accentuate the importance of stores and drive future traffic to our stores. \nOperator: Our next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I also had kind of '21 question and then a bigger picture question. So trying the SG&A question a little bit differently. If I look at what I think your COVID costs were and expenses were in 2020, it was north of $1 billion. And I think I calculate around $750 million in wages for the 2 quarters in the back half of 2020. So in theory, that would imply you lose about $1 billion in SG&A dollars in 2021. Is that the right way to think about it? Because it definitely gets me closer kind of to 7% on the operating margins, obviously, depending on sales. \nMichael Fiddelke: Karen, like similar to the answer I gave, Chris, I think there's going to be a lot of moving variables through the gross margin and SG&A lines. And to get overly precise today about where any one of them comes in, I think, would be a bit of an exercise in false precision. The biggest factor versus a couple of years ago on the SG&A line is going to be the benefit of scale, and we can put that to use in so many ways across the business. And we've got a long history of investing in our team. That was a big part of the journey we embarked on in 2017 and attracting and retaining the best team in retail has been a center of our strategy for the last several years. And we continue to put the team at the forefront this year, and that will continue as well. \nBrian Cornell: Karen, I might as well take the guidance question upfront and kind of remove the bull's eye from Michael's chest, again, no pun intended. But as we sit here today, I think we all recognize this is a very uncertain environment. We're still speculating around what's going to happen with the economy, how employment rates start to recover. While the trends are encouraging right now with the virus, we're all battling COVID each and every day. And while vaccine distribution is accelerating, millions and millions of Americans are still waiting for their turn to get that vaccine. We're still wondering when children go back to school. And when we'll return to the workplace. \n So we approach guidance, recognizing there's lots of uncertainty. But I'll go back to the fact that for most of the last year, we haven't provided guidance, but we have focused on execution. And I think our team has proven to be very flexible, very agile. We responded to the environment and we've been focused on delivering a trusted and safe experience for our guests, whether they're shopping in our stores or online. That focus on execution will continue in 2021. And I wouldn't confuse guidance or the lack thereof with our confidence to continue to take market share and outperform in the coming months and years.\n So I recognize the frustration of not being more precise, particularly on the top line as we think about sales, but I can guarantee you, our entire leadership team and every part of this organization is focused on retaining and growing market share no matter what the variables are we have to face. So I recognize, and we certainly like to be in a different position today, providing more precision. But what I can tell you is we're going to continue to execute our strategy, leverage our capabilities, our owned brands and national brands, our multi-category assortment and our team to continue to build on the momentum we gained in 2020, leverage the additional $15 billion of revenue we now have inside of our P&L and continue to build on the market share we gained in 2020 and make sure that's very sticky for years to come. \n But I recognize for all of you, you'd love more precision around market share. You'd love some more top line insights. I can tell you, we're off to a very strong start in February. In fact, our comps in February started with a 2 handle, and that's a 20 comp in the first part of the year.\n So we'll see how that plays out in March and April, but we're off to a strong start. We took significant market share in the fourth quarter. If you recall our comments in earlier meetings, we talked about the fact that in the first 3 quarters of the year, we had picked up approximately $6 billion of market share. So we added another $3 billion of market share during the holiday season, where all of our competitors were operating. So I think the vibrancy of our model, our ability to execute is something that I would ask all of you to focus in on. And I recognize you've got to do that in light of the fact that we haven't provided the precision that we normally do at this time. \nKaren Short: No, I appreciate that. And I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. With respect to the partnerships that you've announced, what is the gating factor on accelerating or not accelerating some of these partnerships at a faster rate? I mean you've obviously given us the number of remodels that you've done, and I'm sure they're not all a primary target for some of these partnerships, but it seems like you could move a little faster on those. So a little color on that would be great. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. I'll go back over time and think about the work we've been doing for the last 5 or 6 years. We always start by testing and learning. Listening to the guest, listening to our team, iterating along the way, validating our assumptions, both from a sales standpoint and a financial standpoint, before we accelerate. It's the same approach we've taken with remodels over the years and new small formats. It's the same approach we took to Pick Up and Drive Up. And we're doing the same thing as we think about partnerships with great partners like Apple and Ulta Beauty. We want to test and learn, make sure we get the model right. And then as we've demonstrated in the past, we'll hit the accelerator and make sure we expand and leverage scale as quickly as possible. \nKaren Short: Great. And congratulations on a great year. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Maybe just one on '21 and then also a bigger picture for you. So on the gross margin, can you just provide a bit more color on the '21 gross margin settling in a little bit below '19. Is that just simply a function of digital growth getting ahead of sort of potential offsets and merchandising? And then how are you thinking about the gross margin outlook beyond '21? \nBrian Cornell: Sure. The biggest factor in '21 was the supply chain and digital pressure, about 110 basis points of pressure on the year from that. But I think that's actually a good place to illustrate somewhat how we think about rate. Because to me, it's all about the dollar impact, not the rate impact. And digital is a perfect example. If you would have told us we could double the digital business and only see 110 basis points of pressure last year, I think we all would have taken that outcome. But more important than that, when we're growing digital, we're deepening our relationship with guests. And great things happen in aggregate to us when that occurs. \n And so sign me up for more digital growth going forward. We know that's a behavior that will be sticky. Because what comes with that, in addition to a little bit of rate pressure on the margin line, is hugely accretive sales benefits in total. And so biggest driver in 2021 for sure and I would welcome more digital growth going forward and we expect that's a place where we'll continue to excel. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then I just wanted to follow-up with a question on Shipt. Can you provide just a bit more color on what you've seen this year from -- or this past year from like a membership trend standpoint, retail partnership growth? And then taking a step back, what's the competitive synergy of owning this business versus utilizing it as if it was a third party provider? And if there was potential to amount value in something like Shipt, would that be something that would interest you? \nBrian Cornell: John, you want to talk about, Shipt? \nJohn Mulligan: Yes, sure. So we were incredibly pleased with Shipt's performance over the past year. They gained market share, very strong results for the business serving our retail partners. And just as important, and I'll come back to this, is Shipt has become an integral part of Target and our fulfillment on same-day operations. So incredibly important there. But I think the team down in Birmingham did an outstanding job this year, just scaling the business, right? They doubled the number of shoppers. We talked about how the Target sales on Shipt grew by 300%. Memberships grew by 130%. We continue to add great retail partners like Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond and several local and regional grocers. And so they've done just a really great job continuing to scale that business. \n I think when it comes to Shipt and obviously, the relationship with Target, incredibly important part about our same-day options. And you heard us talk all morning today about the key lever that having that suite of fulfillment, same-day fulfillment options for our Target guest has been over the past year and really over the past several years and will continue to be in the future. Not only is that the preferred way our guest continues to grow with us, but they're also economically advantaged. And so we see -- we continue to see huge opportunities for Shipt to continue to work directly with Target to continue to fulfill our guest's needs. \n The other thing I would say, is we see when a -- very similar to Drive Up, when a guest engages with Shipt through Target, again, we see growth in our sales in-store and online on the Target platform as well. So they get more engaged with Target. That is hugely valuable for us. So we bought that capability 3 years ago thinking this is what it would be. It would be incredibly important for us from a same-day perspective. It has only become more so has that accelerated through 2020. \nBrian Cornell: And I'd just go back to a point that we've made a number of times. Our most valuable guest is a guest that uses -- utilizes all of our assets, shops in our stores, leverages Order Pick Up, uses Drive Up when it's convenient for them. And also, more and more, leverages the benefits of a personal shopper through Shipt. So we think that continues to be the easiest place to shop in America. Having all of those assets available for our guests is critically important. And we think those are going to be very sticky over time. Those guests who utilize Drive Up and Shipt during the pandemic, we think there's going to be a lasting connection to those fulfillment options as we go forward in 2021 and beyond. \nOperator: The next question is from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nEdward Yruma: I guess, first, you were pretty early on in raising wages. Do you think that having a premium relative to some of your competitors is important to kind of keep the customer service level high? I guess I'm just asking that because it does seem like industry wages are moving up. And it's kind of a longer-term question, you guys have done a great job of differentiating your soft goods and your hard lines based on design. I guess as you think about food, particularly fresh food, how do you think you can differentiate and grab share? \nBrian Cornell: Ed, I'll go back to the commitment we made at this meeting in 2017, when John Mulligan and I laid out our strategy for the company and talked about the billions of dollars of capital we'd invest in stores, in remodeling stores, in building new stores and building out our digital and fulfillment capabilities. At that time, we said the most important investment we were making was in our team. And I think the results we've seen in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and 2020, is a by-product of that commitment to our team. Investing in wages and benefits, investing in training and career opportunities. And I think it's allowed us to build the best team in retail that's incredibly engaged, that's focused on taking care of our guests, but also taking care of each other. And our team was really the star of 2020. They stepped up during the pandemic and made sure we created a safe shopping environment. \n As we scale Drive Up and saw growth rates of 500% or 600%, they flexed and we're able to meet the needs of the guests. So I think the fact that we've taken a leadership position with wages, invested in our team, provided them the opportunities to grow their careers, that's a hallmark of the commitment we've made at Target to creating the best team in retail. And I think it's provided great returns on investments for shareholders. So we'll continue to make sure we invest in our team. \n To your question around design, the investments we've made in food and beverage, Good & Gather is off to a tremendous start, a multibillion-dollar brand in a short period of time. It's been well received by our guests, great quality, had a great value. And I think it typifies the things we do with our owned brands. And we're very excited about the momentum we had in food and beverage. We took significant market share throughout the year. And the guest has certainly recognized and appreciates the Good & Gather brand. So we think that's a way for us to continue to differentiate our offerings. And as John mentioned, we'll continue to add fresh products to our Drive Up assortment and Pick Up assortment throughout the year, providing our guests access to more of those products that they're looking for each and every day. \nOperator: The next question is from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: So I think the first question I have is really more of, I guess, strategic, structural. Just looking at the growth rate of your fulfillment cost just generally, is that going to be able to go below the growth rate of sales conceivably or conceptually? \nBrian Cornell: Scott, I think on fulfillment costs, we continue to make progress on our fulfillment costs through 2 paths. First is each individual fulfillment service, we continue to lower the absolute cost of providing it. So Order Pick Up today, Drive Up today, Shipt today, ship-from-store, all of those are cheaper than they were 2 years ago. So we continue to see our costs come down there. \n The second way we see our costs come down is through mix. Drive Up, Order Pick Up and Shipt all have much better economics, as we've said for years than shipping from the back of our stores, which also has better economics than shipping from our fulfillment centers. So we -- and they are the fastest-growing portion of our portfolio. In addition to that, ship-from-store grows much faster than fulfillment. So we see favorable mix as well. So we continue to be really pleased with the progress we're making on the unit economics of shipping or delivering goods, fulfilling goods to our guests.\n The only thing I might add to that is, I mean, John talked about the power of having stores hit the hub of that fulfillment equation, and that helps all those marginal economics. But also important not to forget is the thing that matters most economically with digital is the growth in guest spend in total as they become those omnichannel guests that have a deeper relationship with Target overall. \n And so any time we're looking at the slice and dicing of the P&L by channel, which we do a lot of, and we've made a lot of progress getting more efficient over time, that always has to be stapled to the greater impact of that greater guest spend in total as they use more and more of our digital fulfillment services. \n Scott, one of the examples we've shared over the last year is the Target guest that is now using Drive Up, actually spends more money in store. It just deepens that relationship. So we can look at the economics, fulfillment node by fulfillment node, but it's really how it all comes together and how we deepen relationship with our guests, get them to use all of our assets and utilize both stores and digital fulfillment channels over time. So as John said, we're going to continue to improve the economics of each one of those capabilities but it's really the sum of the parts and that deeper relationship we build as our guests use more of our fulfillment nodes over time. \nScott Mushkin: I appreciate that answer. I mean as a follow-up to what you guys are saying. I mean, obviously, Amazon has struggled with this, too, right? Their fulfillment costs grow faster than their sales. So if we're -- and I think, looking at it, as in kind of just as one kind of fulfillment cost, I mean, do you guys see a path ever for -- because I know Amazon struggled here too, like to getting fulfillment costs to grow on a slower basis than your sales? Because that's obviously where the leverage would be able to come in if you can make that happen. \nBrian Cornell: Scott, the place I'd start is the power that the store gives us to fulfill because everything is cheaper when it comes to the store. And that helps us on the cost question that you asked. It's cheaper to ship a box a shorter distance from a local store after it's ridden our supply chain rails all the way to that store. Same-day fulfillment economics look a lot like store economics to us. And that's the piece to John's point that's growing fastest. And so the stores give us an incredible advantage to have advantaged cost profile as we fulfill. \n The other thing that the stores give us that has been incredibly valuable this year is great flexibility. We've seen the ability for stores to scale to meet guests' need in a way that I think probably would have surprised us if we can go back a year in time and see it all coming. But stores are so flexible. There's real power in being able to say, it's that same piece of inventories sitting on a shelf, and we can put it in a box and ship it out the back. We can drop it in a guest's trunk via a Drive Up. They can place it in their cart on a store trip and not having to be able to see perfectly exactly how that demand is going to come, but knowing the inventory can fulfill it and our great store team can make it happen however the guest chooses to shop gives us a huge flexibility advantage as well. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. And just piling on now. The other thing, I go back to what Michael and Brian both said, it's the sum of the parts. And I don't think we need any more than to look at last year to see that when the sum of the parts operate together, we grew digital at an astronomical rate. We grew the store at a great rate. And together, we generated significant profits. So it is the sum of the parts working together that is the real power for us. And then Michael, I think, talked about this today that when you start to disaggregate them, you start picking at things that don't make a whole lot of sense because of the way we package the whole thing together to deliver that for our guests and the economic returns that provides for us in total. \nScott Mushkin: Perfect, guys. And hats off to you guys in the stores and everything else for doing what you did this year. It's just amazing, you could do so much more volume and perform so well. So congratulations on that. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question, I want to ask, I guess, longer-term question on margins. It's sort of outside of '21 so I know '21, there's not a lot of visibility. But I know the conversations we've had about margins is more about there an outcome and you're not managing to a particular margin. Beyond '21, is there anything that could hold margin back in terms of some of the investments that you have planned for the out years? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks for the question, Simeon. When I think about margins in the long run, the straw that will stir that drink is sales growth. And we're incredibly confident in the way we're positioned to build on the deepening guest trust the beginning of this year with long-term sales growth. You can see the power of leverage in our model in an exaggerated way in 2020, no doubt. But that's the focus of where we're investing going forward is to continue to gain share and grow the top line because that gives us a lot of levers to pull below there on the margin line. Yes. \n So the other thing that we've talked about periodically is the importance of mix in our business. And over time, our multi-category portfolio is a huge asset. Christina has been obviously in a merchant chair for a number of years and understands the importance of balancing our multi-category portfolio, the balance between our owned brands and national brands. And as John and Michael have talked about periodically, as we think about the future from a digital standpoint, we think that's going to continue to move more and more towards same-day, which from a mix standpoint is very advantageous to us. So I think our outlook for margin over the long-term is very bullish. \n As we leverage our multi-category portfolio, we continue to build our owned brands as well as great national brand partners. But as we continue to see guests take advantage of the speed and convenience of same-day digital fulfillment, all those things add up to a very healthy mix management and margin control. \nSimeon Gutman: Great. Okay. And my follow-up is on the $9 billion of share that you gained in 2020. I saw it was one of the pillars in that pyramid debt foundation. Can you talk about how you're thinking about retaining it? Anything more in terms of -- you're hoping to keep 100% of it and build from it. Can you share a range of outcomes in terms of share retention? And then anything on the categories that you think you can make the most headway with in 2021? \nBrian Cornell: Simeon, I'll come back to -- we saw a really strong share performance against our entire portfolio in 2020. And that continued in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to be in a strong share position in 2021. Obviously, we're still sorting through what the overall industry performance will look like, category by category as we think about 2021. But I'll let Christina comment on some of the early observations that we have as we think about the strength in our owned brands, some of the newness that we're bringing to market, the new national brand partnerships and the great investments we have with both our owned brand and national brand vendor partners. So I think we're well positioned to continue to grow share. And I think the investments we're making in our stores and the store experience and in digital positions us well to continue to grow share for years to come. \nChristina Hennington: Yes. I might add a few points there, but to really punctuate what Brian said is the multi-category portfolio that we have gives us so much flexibility. And if we follow the guest, we will deliver. We -- when the guests chose not to really change their order very much and more yield pass all year, it had an impact on the apparel industry, yet we significantly outpaced the performance in that industry. This year, people are going to buy new clothes because people don't want to wear the same thing over and over. They'll do their makeup. They might even buy a piece of luggage if they're venturing out of the trip. And that ability to flex with the needs of the guests through the breadth of our portfolio is what's going to keep us growing share and gaining against the industry for years to come. \nSimeon Gutman: Great, and congratulations. \nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies. \nCorey Grady: This is Corey Grady on for Steph Wissink. I wanted to follow-up on the February comp comment. How much of that strength would you attribute to stimulus? And can you compare the impact of this round on what you saw last summer? \nBrian Cornell: Yes. We've spent a lot of time trying to sort through some of the factors behind that. Again, I think so much of it has been the investments we've made in safety and the shopping experience throughout the last year. We certainly have seen guests shop all of our categories in the month of February. So broad-based strength. And I think, again, the guest is responding to some of the newness in our assortment. And to Christina's point, they're looking for the opportunity to shop our stores and find new items. They're tired of the yoga pants and really appreciate some of the new assortment we have in apparel. They're still shopping for their homes as they refresh the core. They're still heating at home so kitchen and food-related items are still really important. \n So we see a guest shopping all of our categories, taking advantage of both stores and our digital channels. And I think it's a byproduct of the investments we've made throughout the pandemic to build trust to make sure they know we've got a safe shopping environment and the great work that our teams have done to make sure that they're focused every day on meeting the needs to our guests. So very encouraged with the month of February. And we'll continue to make sure we stay agile and flexible to meet the needs of the guests throughout the next 11 months. \nCorey Grady: As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your inventory position. Where do you stand on in-stock positions today? Are you seeing any gaps that you feel you need to remediate in the near term? \nBrian Cornell: Christina? \nChristina Hennington: We're very pleased with our inventory position. We continue to build in support of sales. And the reality is that we are -- we're looking to fill in the gaps where we have a few selectively, but it's been a marked improvement throughout the year and the responsiveness of our team is incredible. We have not only a very responsible supply chain team here in the United States, but across the whole world. That intel and insight allows us to manage a very complex supply chain with efficiency and always been focused on getting our out of stocks in the best position possible. \nBrian Cornell: And Corey, an opportunity to really thank our vendor partners who have been very responsive to meeting our needs. Obviously, no one anticipated the kind of comps we were driving in 2020. I talked about the almost historic number we delivered in January, and our vendor partners have been very responsive, working with our merchants and supply chain teams to ensure that we fill in some of those gaps and have the inventory we need as we go forward. \nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious when you look back on 2020, how many new customers were new to Target? And how did that break down versus when you acquired them first half or second half? And is there anything you can share in terms of the patterns that you saw in terms of those gained in the first half? How did they spend in the second half? Maybe talk about the frequency and spend in their purchases. \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. I can start. Thanks for the question, Paul. As we think about new customers, no doubt, there are some new customers to Target this year. We've shared some of the digital guests that we've gained in past calls. The thing that we're most focused on is deepening the relationship of those guests that have really stepped up their trust and their spend and their share of wallet with Target over the last year. And so we talked about the 12 million new omnichannel guests this year. That's the place where we focused a lot of that kind of deepening of the guest relationship and the things that we're tracking. We're encouraged to see the stickiness of a lot of the new behaviors that were tried in 2020. \n So things like Drive Up, thanks to the incredible experience our store teams provide. Once guests try a service like that, they come back and we've seen higher rates of stickiness this year than historically for some of those digital fulfillment services. And that bodes well for the stickiness of those guests and those behaviors going forward. And so while we do watch new guests, and it's great to get a new guest and convert them to a deeper Target guests over time, a lot of America shops Target and it's the deepening of those existing guests as they shop us in new and different ways and more often, that's our focus. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Paul, the only other point I would add is, as we've looked at the guests during the pandemic, we know they're consolidating where they shop. And we may have had a Target guest that was shopping for home or beauty, but they're now shopping for apparel, picking up food and beverage, exploring new categories. They may be coming to us for electronics and toys. So to Michael's point, while most of America shops with Target, during the pandemic, we've seen consumers consolidate the number of places where they shop. They're now experiencing and are active in more categories, and we think that provides lasting benefits for us for years to come.\n Operator, it looks like we've got time for one final question today. \nOperator: Our last question is from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to kind of continue on that train of thought, Brian, with regard to customers come in for one thing, they shop for others, what are you guys doing from a data analytics standpoint and to really stimulate the customer to buy more items beyond what they normally buy? And I was just curious where we're at in terms of the data analytics and leveraging the data to really harness it and make it more useful. \nBrian Cornell: Joe, obviously, it's been a big area of focus for us for many years. And I'll come back to something we haven't talked about a lot today, which is the membership within Target Circle. The fact that we now have 90 million members in Target Circle, which gives us an understanding of their needs, their wants, how they're shopping, new categories and new items we can introduce them to. So we're going to continue to make sure we leverage Target Circle to build deeper relationships, introduce that guest to new categories, new fulfillment options. And over time, we think that's a very valuable asset that will continue to drive growth, help us build market share and continue the momentum that we established in 2020. \n So with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing all of you in person in 2022. And obviously, John and Michael will be available for any follow-up questions today or over the balance of the week. \n So thank you for joining us, and stay well.",

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. While most people expect the operations guy to get right into the technical stuff, like capacity, throughput and automation, and don't worry, I will get there, I'm going to start with our people, the Target team. In a year when the flexibility and scalability of our operation was pressure tested, our team rose to the challenge, just like they always do. They were the connection between processes, technology and physical assets, that allow us to deliver safety, ease, reliability and even a bit of joy during a year of uncertainty for our guests. Of course, the team wasn't starting from scratch. As you heard already this morning, we've been investing in them for years and building capabilities that would set them up to better serve our guests in any time, let alone a global pandemic. \n Let me take you back for a minute to one of our favorite reference points. It was early 2016 and Target's strategy was coming into focus. After years of testing and listening to our guests, we knew that betting on our stores, an uncommon proposition at the time, would be at the heart of a durable and scalable model. And we needed an operation with the right capabilities to drive it. Getting there wouldn't be fast or easy. Quarter-after-quarter, we tested, iterated and learned how to modernize our supply chain, update our stores, use them as fulfillment hubs and train our team to bring every part to life. Then we had to learn how to do it at scale.\n In 2019, all these efforts started operating together, and we saw tangible proof through financial results, market share gains and guest satisfaction scores that our work was paying off. Fast forward to 2020, we were ready for the world to change. But only because of the years we'd spent laying the operational foundation. The story of how we navigated the twists and turns of 2020 starts with replenishment because the whole operation relies on getting the right product to the right place at the right time. This last quarter, 95% of all sales, online and in person were fulfilled by our stores, which is why it's critical they have enough of the inventory our guests want to buy. Without that piece, the operation simply stops. When the pandemic hit last spring, our guest shopping behaviors changed nearly overnight. We saw heavy stock up trips, huge in-store surges and then a quick shift to online shopping. To meet the needs of the guests, our supply chain had to turn on a dime.  \n We sent hundreds more deliveries than we planned every day to replenish stores fast and often. Flexibility we'd learned from opening dozens of small format stores. We prioritize the flow of essential inventory like paper towels and cleaning wipes, to quickly send stores more of what they needed, not just what was planned. As we sold every paper product we had last March, we expedited everything we could from our vendor partners and secured greater allocations of additional inventory as they ramped up to produce more.\n In a normal year, we just spent months preparing for the traditional Q4 shopping spike. But in 2020, our peak season started in March. And after months of moving record volume, we have become increasingly efficient in how we managed high levels of demand. So when the holidays actually did arrive, we leaned into what was already working. We sent more inventory to stores than ever to prepare for an earlier holiday rush. We front-loaded those deliveries with the seasonal merchandise guests would expect so our stores would be stocked and ready, and we continue prioritizing essential products, like cleaning supplies and health care items, so we could keep meeting the pressing needs of our guests.\n The flexibility of our supply chain set up our stores to play an essential role in our communities. Because we could restock shelves quickly, guests could count on Target for what they needed, whether they came inside or shopped online. And when our digital business picked up last spring, our fulfillment operation went into high gear. Up to that point, our same-day fulfillment services had already been rolled out nationwide. Millions of guests were loving them because they're fast and easy. We always love them because they're incredibly efficient. Without the shipping expense, these orders look much more like a store sale than a traditional online transaction, costing on average 90% less than if we'd shipped it from a warehouse. And at the start of 2020, our same-day sales were growing at a healthy clip. Come spring, when consumers saw the need for more contactless ways to shop, those services exploded. And we had the infrastructure in place to grow alongside demand. \n Brian gave you the full year highlights on Drive Up, up more than 600%, and even Order Pick Up, which has been around for years, still grew more than 70%.  Beyond our pickup options, the delivery capability we have in Shipt became even more important. It filled the need for guests who wanted an online order, especially for perishable items, but also for so many other essentials across Target, brought right to their front doors. It offered more personalization, reliability and speed than they could get from a packaged shipment. And as a result Shipt's target sales grew more than 300%. Of course, we continue to ship online orders from the back of our local stores, saving 40% of the cost of shipping from a warehouse, an economic advantage for us as digital sales now account for even more of our total revenue.\n With third-party carriers fielding historic levels of volume, we worked closely with our partners to plan for capacity constraints and send millions and millions of packages to guest store's steps. But the popularity of our same-day services gave guests another option to shop from home, yet receive their orders faster, reliably and on their own time. Guests had Shipt deliver when it matched their schedule instead of guessing when a shipment would arrive. They drove through our pickup lanes when they were already out and about. No appointment required. This gave guests a flexibility they couldn't find anywhere else. The extraordinary growth of those services has shown just how much guests value that convenience, speed and peace of mind and the comfort they find in having a contactless option.\n In fact, we found that what we built to make Target the easiest place to shop had also set us up to be one of the safest. I've said countless times that a benefit of using our stores as hubs is our ability to ramp-up in peak times and ramp back down based on demand. This last year, the stores ramped up and stayed there. In early spring, our stores were fulfilling more in a single day than they had an entire week the year before, day after day after day. At the same time, they were also continuing to support a safe and easy in-store experience, which also drove strong comps. As our digital business continued to pick up steam, our stores sustained that pace for months on end. Records were set and then broken again and again and again.  \n But the years we spent building a rock-solid fulfillment capability in our stores prepared us to handle waves of volume without sacrificing the guest experience. Stores knew how to staff for peaks, train other store team members to pitch in when things got busy and adjust storage space to hold more orders. Despite wild growth, our Net Promoter Scores that represent guest satisfaction stayed incredibly high. It's one thing for our teams to adjust to record volume, but it's even more impressive to do it while we enhance the services themselves. As digital demand surged, we simultaneously broadened the assortment to make even more of the store available for same-day fulfillment. We added apparel to Shipt's delivery offerings and tested adult beverage pickup in a handful of markets. Most notably, we added fresh and frozen grocery to Drive Up and Order Pick Up. Although this expansion was already in the plan, we accelerated the rollout to go nationwide this summer, offering even more guests essential groceries through our contactless services. \n Importantly, we also adjusted the process to make our services even safer and more efficient. With Drive Up and Order Pick Up, guests now display a PIN on their phones from a distance or through a car window so teams can securely deliver the right order while staying farther apart. We gave additional store team members back up training and fulfillment. For example, when we temporarily closed our Starbucks cafe\u0301s, we taught hundreds of baristas how to efficiently pick and pack an order. That allowed us to keep those team members on the schedule and build their skills, while also helping us manage high volumes during peak times. And we added thousands of Drive Up parking spots, so guests could get in and out even faster.\n At the same time, Shipt more than doubled its shopper network to increase the number of delivery windows it could offer to keep up with soaring demand. It's worth taking a minute to emphasize that using our stores to support digital demand is only possible because of the trust and collaboration across many teams at Target. It's not just a stores operation or a supply chain effort, it's the product of many teams strategizing around a common purpose to deliver for our guests. That one team mindset is what built the capabilities we have today and is what allowed us to adjust swiftly when the business accelerated unexpectedly. \n We built an operation to handle the healthy digital growth we expected through the middle of this decade. The only surprise was that we got there last year much sooner than planned. Although we designed for that kind of flexibility and scale in the long run, our team hadn't planned for it to come all at once, and that's what makes their outstanding execution with no advanced warning, all the more remarkable. Advancing the business several years in a matter of months prove that our model is scalable and also prove we have the capacity to grow.  \n I'd remind you of what I've shared in several of our past earnings calls. A reliable way to assess our stores throughput capacity is to look at the sales we do per square foot. And you can see that productivity has grown a lot over the last couple of years for our average stores, but also for our top quartile. The fact that we continue to see more throughput in our highest-performing stores shows the capacity we have across the rest of the chain for even more growth in the future.\n With all the expectations we have for our stores, the physical buildings themselves play a huge role in our strategy. We're as committed as ever to our years long initiative to remodel stores with an inspirational specialty store feel that makes shopping easy and convenient. At the beginning of last year, we'd started about 130 full store remodels. In mid-March, to reduce distractions in our stores, we decided to complete the projects we'd started. Then we pivoted to more targeted improvements that emphasize safety, like installing plexiglass dividers and reformatting our sales floor for greater distancing.\n The timing for our small-format stores also shifted. After pausing construction in the spring, our teams accelerated the work through the summer and fall to finalize more than 2 dozen stores for new local guests. Despite stopping the work for part of the year, we still opened 29 small format stores, the most completed in 1 year-to-date. From the Las Vegas Strip to UC San Diego, our first store right on campus property, we tapped into new communities. And we continued expanding across markets like New York and L.A. With each one, Target brought a safe and essential shopping experience to even more guests, while positioning us to serve those neighborhoods for years to come.\n Our construction and store design teams also adjusted following the demonstrations for racial justice this summer. One of our Minneapolis stores required an entire rebuild. Without it, the local community had nowhere nearby to get essentials like baby formula and fresh food. So we partnered with local nonprofits to distribute needed supplies while putting plans in motion to reopen fast. We leaned on the expertise we developed remodeling stores and opening small formats to meet the community's needs. We listened to nearby residents, worked with local contractors, personalized the in-store experience and reopened months later as a convenient shopping destination, but also as a better partner to the neighborhood. Take a look.  \n [Presentation] From that video alone, it's clear that our team is dedicated, tireless and incredibly compassionate when it comes to serving our communities. You saw it in the opening video and you've heard it throughout this morning. Our team is the heartbeat of Target. And even when faced with challenges, they bring their A game. \n Several years ago, we implemented a new operating model in our stores to lift up that drive. It was a shift towards specialized roles to give our teams expertise, empowerment and a sense of ownership in how they serve our guests. With that model in place, our team could quickly adapt to the ups and downs in 2020, execute well and play an essential role in our communities. Now like anything in life, balance is good, and we found opportunities to train our specialists in other areas like teaching a hardlines expert how to fulfill an online order. So they gain skills beyond their specialized position. Those investments in their development also add flexibility to our operation.\n We've always known that supporting our team would have great returns and it has. In addition to the bonuses, time off options, wellbeing benefits and expanded nationwide starting wage that Brian mentioned, we also gave our team even more hours. With a greater investment in our trained and expert workforce, we saw turnover drop and guest satisfaction rise. It's a strong testament to what can be done when we empower our teams to use their skills and passions to serve our guests. The bottom line is that as our business grew exponentially, our operation flexed alongside. And as we delivered for our guests, we built on the trust they put in us to meet their needs and make it easy.  \n Going forward, we're taking the capabilities that drove Target in 2020 and accelerating them to continue making Target, the safest and easiest place to shop. As we do, we'll invest in more capacity and greater efficiencies. So we're positioned to continue growing for the long term.\n In our supply chain, that starts with expanding our network so we continue to have replenishment capacity that can support our future growth. In recent years, we accommodated steady sales growth through our existing supply chain network by increasing the productivity of our buildings. In fact, the average sales per foot supported by our distribution centers rose nearly 30% between 2016 and 2020, thanks to a series of process and technology improvements. During those years, we didn't open any new DCs to support replenishment. But after our business grew nearly 20% last year, with 95% of sales driven by our stores, it's time to expand our supply chain so we can support a much higher base of sales and continue growing.\n This year, we'll open 2 distribution centers to support replenishment, 1 close to the New Jersey Delaware state line and another in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago. And we currently have plans for one on each coast in 2022. We're also continuing to simplify the unload process once product reaches the stores. In a nutshell, it all comes down to how we sort and organize millions of items before they arrive at the stores' loading dock.  \n We've shown you the robotics capabilities we're building to help us sort inventory to the precise amount of store needs and organize it by store aisle. When we do, replenishment in stores is fast. Team members grab a tote, walk to the aisle and stock the shelf. No sorting in the back room or finding places to stash cases of excess product. We have 2 solutions that help us do that. We showed you both of these independently last year: 1 called auto-rebin sorts individual items. This is most useful for slower moving inventory, when stores only need a handful of items to put back on the shelf. Auto-rebin started in one of our local Minnesota warehouses, rolled out to 2 more and we'll expand to another 2 this year. \n The second is the robotic ships order we've been building at our Perth Amboy facility. This sorts everything, from boxes of individual items to entire cases of product. After the sort, robot sequence inventory so our team can load pallets in an order that saves stores even more time. Individually, these capabilities are hugely valuable, but they're designed to work together. This spring, we'll put both solutions in 1 warehouse to test how they bring more precision and speed to store replenishment. In Q4, we'll run them together at a small scale, doing what we always do to learn and iterate before we go bigger. Opening new warehouses and expanding our robotics capabilities are both about moving product more easily to stores. \n But just as important is being ready to send what stores need before they even know it. This year, we'll continue expanding the rollout of our predictive inventory positioning capability across our assortment. This helps us more precisely order and position product close to where we anticipate guests will want it so we can react quickly when there's demand. In turn, it improves out of stocks and lowers backroom inventory levels. In 2020, when sales spiked, this capability allowed us to order and restock products 25% faster than using our old systems. This year, we'll use it to order and position even more items in our assortment, so we can replenish the majority of the store faster for our guests. \n We've talked about how store replenishment feeds store fulfillment. This past year, our team was able to keep filling online orders because our supply chain was replenishing that inventory with speed and precision. While we continue refining our replenishment operation, we'll also build on our fulfillment capabilities to enhance the guest experience and make way for future growth. Today, the majority of our store assortment is available through our same-day services, but we're continually working to give guests even more choices. In coming months, we'll expand our pickup options further into categories like apparel and fresh food and roll adult beverage pickup to 800 more stores.\n We're also continuing to improve the Target Run so it's even easier for our guests and faster for our team. For example, Drive Up guests will be able to share more preferences in the app, like telling the team where to place the order in their vehicle or signing an alternate pickup person so it's easier for a spouse or family member to pick it up. We're numbering our Drive Up spaces so our teams can find guests sooner for those times when a guest pulls up in a black SUV next to 8 other black SUVs. And we're updating the team member app, so they can more easily see what orders are in progress and where they can help.\n Our same-day services have grown faster than any other fulfillment method. But when we do ship online orders, we'll continue sending the majority of those packages out the back of our stores. Since 2016, we scaled our ship-from-store capability from a low tech test in a few hundred stores to a sophisticated fulfillment operation in most Target backrooms. Now before anyone gets too worked up, I don't mean we have robots hiding in the back. Instead, we've got efficient tools, technology and process design working together, continually increasing the number of orders a store can fulfill.\n Next, we'll take it a step further, developing last mile capabilities that help us continue scaling this operation so we can ship more orders from stores on even lower cost. To do it, we're testing a new type of facility here in Minneapolis called a sortation center. The idea is to make our stores' hub model even more efficient, while also reducing our load on external carriers. Take a look.  \n [Presentation] This capability frees up time and space in our stores, which we can redirect into fulfilling more orders. In the end, it allows us to get orders to guests faster and at a lower cost. While we're still ramping up production at this first test facility, we're very confident in this concept and plan to open 5 additional sites in other urban markets later this year.\n In 2021, we'll also open more stores, accelerating our growth with 30 to 40 new locations a year, a pace we'll keep up for the foreseeable future. With our small format strategy, we'll expand in urban markets like Portland, L.A. and New York City, where there are still opportunities to serve new guests. And we'll continue our focus on college stores with the University of Georgia and the University of Michigan planned for later this year. We remain extremely bullish on our college sites. Even as the pandemic sent students to online classrooms and sales softened at many of those stores, we see them as a long-term play to serve the college guests, many of whom are on the brink of adulthood and building lifelong shopping habits.\n We'll also open a number of midsized stores to serve dense suburban neighborhoods from Denver to Brooklyn. As hundreds of retail vacancies have left holes in communities across the country, we've committed to sites where we can fill a need for the local guests. And as retail real estate prices have declined this year, we found these opportunities to serve new communities to be even more affordable. Along with opening new stores, we'll get back to remodeling our existing fleet. After stopping our full store remodels last spring, we'll pick back up later this year and complete about 150 stores in time for holiday, and we'll plan to ramp up to more than 200 stores a year in 2022 and beyond. \n Safety and ease have become the heart of Target shopping experience, and we'll incorporate what we learned during 2020 into our future store design. That includes implementing more contactless features, from our restrooms to our checkouts and adding distance between merchandise and at the check lanes. And as you heard from Christina, we'll also bring brand partnerships to life in our stores throughout 2021. A great example is the work we'll do to add Ulta Beauty to our sales floor, creating a specialty environment that's seamlessly integrated into the Target experience. Similarly, we'll use store design elements to highlight additional brands like Disney and Apple for our guests. \n We're investing in a lot of really exciting developments to fuel Target's growth. But what they all have in common, they're giving our team the tools or the backdrop to take better care of our guests and each other. That shows up most in our stores where the vast majority of our 350,000 team members bring our brand to life for guests across the country. A huge priority for our stores this year is adjusting our staffing strategies to create more predictability for our team. That's a challenge in any retail job, where ours are based on dynamic factors like consumer shopping patterns and changing team needs. But we know having an engaged team with more consistent hours leads to higher productivity, greater efficiency and lower turnover. It creates a place where people join to learn a job and stay to build a career and better serve our guests in the long run. So we'll train team members to take on other roles across the store and offer the option for longer shifts.\n We'll also build on our stores' operating model by introducing a new standard of service to our teams. It's not a checklist, but a set of principles that define great service, like welcoming a guest and paying attention to what they need, which might be as simple as finding an item or as big as building an outfit. It's meant to give our team flexibility and empower them to do what's right for the guests in the moment. Without our team, everything else you heard today comes to a standstill. The Target team continues to be the most important part of our operation, and I want to say an enormous thank you to all our team members for all they do to serve our guests and our communities.\n You've seen us make a lot of operational investments over the last few years, in our team, in our stores and in our capacity for long-term growth. In the most recent quarter, those returns were clear. We've created an operation unlike anyone else with our physical assets working together, centered on our stores and fueled by our team to serve our guests and grow for the long term. The capabilities we built not only allowed us to navigate the most volatile time in retail history but show that they can flex and grow to serve the ever-changing needs of the consumer. The work isn't done. We're constantly refining an operation that is efficient, fast and supportive of Target's durable and scalable business model. From an engineer by training and a finance guy at heart, I can attest that you can't get too efficient or relevant enough. There's no finish line for continuous improvement and innovation. We'll keep making bets on the capabilities that give us the flexibility to serve guests well into the future.\n We have a lot of strength heading into 2021 and a lot of work still in front of us. But with a sound operational foundation and the talent and resilience of the Target team driving us ahead, I look forward to sharing our progress in the quarters and years to come.  \n With that, Michael, I'll hand it over to you. \n [Presentation] Yes, sure. So we were incredibly pleased with Shipt's performance over the past year. They gained market share, very strong results for the business serving our retail partners. And just as important, and I'll come back to this, is Shipt has become an integral part of Target and our fulfillment on same-day operations. So incredibly important there. But I think the team down in Birmingham did an outstanding job this year, just scaling the business, right? They doubled the number of shoppers. We talked about how the Target sales on Shipt grew by 300%. Memberships grew by 130%. We continue to add great retail partners like Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond and several local and regional grocers. And so they've done just a really great job continuing to scale that business. \n I think when it comes to Shipt and obviously, the relationship with Target, incredibly important part about our same-day options. And you heard us talk all morning today about the key lever that having that suite of fulfillment, same-day fulfillment options for our Target guest has been over the past year and really over the past several years and will continue to be in the future. Not only is that the preferred way our guest continues to grow with us, but they're also economically advantaged. And so we see -- we continue to see huge opportunities for Shipt to continue to work directly with Target to continue to fulfill our guest's needs. \n The other thing I would say, is we see when a -- very similar to Drive Up, when a guest engages with Shipt through Target, again, we see growth in our sales in-store and online on the Target platform as well. So they get more engaged with Target. That is hugely valuable for us. So we bought that capability 3 years ago thinking this is what it would be. It would be incredibly important for us from a same-day perspective. It has only become more so has that accelerated through 2020. Yes. And just piling on now. The other thing, I go back to what Michael and Brian both said, it's the sum of the parts. And I don't think we need any more than to look at last year to see that when the sum of the parts operate together, we grew digital at an astronomical rate. We grew the store at a great rate. And together, we generated significant profits. So it is the sum of the parts working together that is the real power for us. And then Michael, I think, talked about this today that when you start to disaggregate them, you start picking at things that don't make a whole lot of sense because of the way we package the whole thing together to deliver that for our guests and the economic returns that provides for us in total."

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 Financial Community Meeting. We're eager to share our insights on the extraordinary year that just passed, as well as our vision for what's next. But I couldn't start today without reflecting on the fact that 1 year ago at this time, the pandemic was just beginning to unfold. And in an effort to keep everyone safe and limit travel, we decided to convert this meeting to a virtual format. While we miss hosting our in person gatherings, it's prudent to stick with virtual presentations once again this year. But we're looking forward to resuming our live events, including this one and our Annual Shareholders Meeting in 2022.\n As I look back over the past year, a year when so much care and compassion was called for, I see purpose, coupled with capabilities as the essential enabler of our response. And the story of Target in 2020 is the story of a team that wanted nothing more than to take care of those around us, drawing on capabilities that were equal to that ambition after years of building an investment.  \n So I want to start today by publicly recognizing and thanking our team. I'm incredibly proud of the resilience, empathy, care and concern they've shown for each other, our guests and communities through a very challenging 12 months and counting. None of what we'll share today would've happened without them. Even before the dramatic challenges of last year took hold, our team had been busy building the retail platform of tomorrow. But 2020 accelerated everything and, as such, our guests are already benefiting from and loving that platform today. At the heart of the platform was the belief that consumers would continue to flock to out stores for multicategory one-stop shopping; a friendly, well-trained and knowledgeable team; and joyful experiences.\n As we designed our strategy and invested accordingly, we relentlessly asked ourselves what products and services those stores should offer, where they should be located, how their operations should be tailored to meet neighborhood needs and ultimately, how to make our stores work together with all of our other assets as one shopping platform that would keep guests turning to Target however they want to shop. In answering those questions, we did 2 things at once: We placed the physical store more firmly at the center of our omnichannel platform and we created a durable, sustainable and scalable business model that puts Target on a road of our own.\n Our goal was to use our proximity, nearly 1,900 stores within 10 miles of the vast majority of the U.S. consumers to offer the fastest and easiest digital fulfillment in retail. And the capabilities we built to become America's easiest place to shop also cracked the essential question of how to grow our digital sales exponentially, while maintaining the overall profitability of our business. When we began this journey, we didn't know we would be facing a global pandemic, mass quarantines, rapid unemployment and the need to limit the number of people in public spaces. And yet, when those threats emerged in 2020, we were ready. And without hesitation, millions of American families turned to Target like never before. That happened because of decisions we made 4 and 5 years ago. And today, Christina Hennington, our recently named Chief Growth Officer, along with John Mulligan and Michael Fiddelke, will join me in mapping out how our team's efforts in recent years created a new baseline from which we'll continue to climb higher for our guests.\n And here's what I hope you'll take away from our story. First, that our team's ability to act and react in 2020 was years in the making. Without our multiyear roadmap to develop new capabilities and bring them to scale, 2020 could've exposed essential gaps in our business model. Instead, it proved beyond a doubt the durability of our model and it signaled our potential for continued growth in years ahead.\n The second takeaway stems from a question I've heard frequently, especially in 2020, \"Brian, what's the secret to Target's growth trajectory?\" What you'll see in our presentation today is that the one thing that's driving our success is a focused commitment to several things: an integrated collection of strategies and capabilities that all work together, are very difficult to replicate and, ultimately, make Target unique.\n I'll start today with a high level recap of our full year results. When we gathered virtually for this meeting last year, I shared how our revenue had grown by $5.4 billion since 2017, and that we were consistently gaining share in many of our core merchandising categories. In other words, we were already starting to see steady growth from our investments.\n When we left that meeting, no one knew that COVID-19 would be declared a pandemic in the United States, only a couple of weeks later. In hindsight, it's hard to believe that we only receive one COVID-related question that day. But today, as we look back on 2020, the business highlights are clear: Our revenue during the year increased another $15 billion. We gained meaningful market share across all 5 of our merchandising categories, totaling about $9 billion. Our full year comparable sales were up more than 19%, with a store comp of more than 7% in a year when people were staying home to stay safe, and a digital comp of 145%. Standing at this meeting 3 or 4 years ago, it would have been hard for any of us, or any of you, to imagine digital penetration of 18% without a dramatic deterioration in our P&L. Yet today, we announced record high full year adjusted EPS of $9.42. \n Importantly, we accomplished all of this while making huge incremental investments in our team's safety and well-being and completely reoutfitting our stores to keep our team and guests safe. Far for being a fluke, this performance is further proof that we've built a business model that is working as intended, one that puts Target in a category of its own.  \n A few consistent pillars have been and will continue to be at the heart of our playbook. The enormous investments we made in supply chain, store operations and technology capabilities are already powering exponential growth in digital commerce. They've enabled us to use our stores and showrooms and service centers, but also as hubs for digital fulfillment. Without these investments, we simply wouldn't have been able to satisfy the exploding guest demand for same-day services, represented by more than 600% growth in Drive Up. \n Likewise, Shipt is an extraordinary capability that grew by more than 300% last year and will continue to grow as more guests recognize the power of having their purchases brought to their doorstep in as little as 1 hour. We have consistently invested in our merchandising strength, like our differentiated owned brand portfolio, our curated national brands, inspired limited time offering and strategic relationships that run the gamut from web only start-ups looking for omnichannel scale to premier partners like Disney, Apple, Levi's and Ulta Beauty.\n We're continuously improving our physical and digital shopping experience, investing billions in store remodels, specialized store rows and service training for our teams, while continuing to open up new small formats in urban centers, major college campuses and iconic tourist destinations. Most importantly, we're continuing to invest in our team. Even before 2020's outsized incremental expenditures on team health and safety, Target was an employer of choice, an academy company for those looking for a rewarding and purposeful careers. In addition to accelerating our $15 starting wage in 2020, we celebrated our team's exceptional efforts with 5 separate recognition bonuses, most recently in January when we invested another $200 million to reward each of our frontline team members $500. \n As we develop capabilities, like Target Circle, or acquire them, like Shipt, we do so with a clear vision for how they'll work together in service to our guests. Ultimately, the value they create in our core business has to contribute to our retail offering that's greater than the sum of the parts. But when we look at these elements individually, it's strikingly clear how much value we've added in a very short time. In 2016, our digital transformation was only beginning, we weren't even a top 10 e-commerce provider, and we were just getting our same-day services off the ground. Today, we have the most complete suite of same-day fulfillment services in the industry. We're one of the leading e-commerce players. And for Click and Collect same-day services, we continue to deliver industry-leading growth and dollar volume as well as Net Promoter Scores over 80% despite record demand.\n In 2016, we had about 30 small format stores. Today, we have 140 and we'll add another 30 to 40 per year over the next several years. If these stores were standalone chain, they're revenue would rival that of fast-growing chains with many more locations. In 2016, we launched Pillowfort and Cat & Jack, touching off our owned brand reinvention that has since resulted in more than 30 new brands, with more on the way this year. By the time we gathered for this meeting last year, Cat & Jack and 5 other owned brands were generating $1 billion or more apiece in annual sales, and that tally has continued to grow.\n We cleared 2020 with 10 of owned brands each generating $1 billion or more and 4 of those across the $2 billion per year threshold. Any one of these brands alone would be a sizable retailer and, as you know, their contribution profits is outsized. Of course, owned and exclusive brands are just one component of our merchandising strategy, which is always run on curated national brands across our assortment.\n As we've expanded capabilities in recent years, we've also steadily built our roster of strategic partners. Levi's is an excellent example of how we can build upon a longstanding collaboration and help strategic partners catapult into new product categories. We started partnering with Levi's years ago on the DENIZEN denim brand and that partnership grew to include Levi's Red Tab apparel and build out presence in hundreds of stores and on target.com. Just this last Sunday, we launched the Levi's for Target collection, a limited time offering of home goods. This is the first foray by Levi's into this category and it's a great example of combining their strengths with ours, including our incredible sourcing and product design and development capabilities to forge new potential for both of our brands.\n Meanwhile, our team is also gearing up to introduce Ulta Beauty at Target to our stores and target.com, starting with the first 100 stores later this year. From this initial batch, we'll test, we'll learn and we'll expand hundreds of additional locations over time. This partnership combines Ulta Beauty's unparalleled assortment, category expertise and guest loyalty with our large high-growth traffic-driving beauty business and the ease and convenience of our fulfillment services. Together, we'll be able to offer guests access to established, emerging and prestige beauty brands as well as expert beauty consultation in an industry leading omnichannel retail experience.\n As a standalone or isolated innovation, each of these elements I mentioned, has something in common with the other. Each was advanced based on how it would complement out other assets and capabilities and we tested each one with an eye towards scale. In fact, the ability to integrate and scale is a key component of our decision making. And to emphasize the critical importance of scalability, I simply think back to what we could've done in 2016 but didn't. At that time, conventional wisdom held that the only way forward was for retailers to build capacity, to send more packages to homes. Instead, we went our own way, built a fulfillment model with our guest local store at the center and took the initiative on same-day. We could just as easily have constructed additional fulfillment centers and driven the shift to digital sales with more ship-to-home capacity. But as you know, the economics were terrible and we wouldn't have been differentiated.\n In short, we didn't see the textbook solution as scalable or as likely to do what we've done, namely set the groundwork for years of guest satisfaction and brand loyalty, as represented by comments like this, \"Thank you for providing curbside pickup. It actually was the determining factor in me buying from Target instead of one of those online retailers.\" Or this, or this or this note from a guest who simply said, \"Please always continue to do curbside pick up. It is such a help even outside of COVID. This is a wonderful service and I'll continue to choose Target for this very reason.\"\n So where do we go from here? And how do we keep climbing from this strong new baseline? In the near term, we'll continue to generate incredible value by executing on our strategy. Throughout the pandemic, we've built deep trust and loyalty with our guests who clearly prefer the ease and everyday inspiration of shopping at Target, along with our relentless commitment to the safety and cleanliness of our shopping environment. This is a decades long commitment that was only emphasized by the pandemic, and it will continue to be a differentiator in the months and years ahead.\n Our multi-category merchandise portfolio is a huge advantage, particularly as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. And we're absolutely committed to delivering value and everyday affordability, which is important in any environment, but particularly as the economic consequences of COVID continue to play out. At the same time, we'll continue to listen closely to our stakeholders and to build upon our strategy. So in the years ahead, you'll see continuous iteration and improvement in the pillars I've mentioned already. But we'll also focus on better localizing our experience, applying learning from our small format expansion. And we'll continue to build scale and personalizing the experience, leveraging capabilities like Target Circle to better understand our guests and find new ways to engage and reward the 90 million members who have joined so far.\n To ensure we're continuously delivering great value and emphasizing everyday affordability, we'll stay laser focused on being priced right daily. And on showcasing our value with clear messaging and relevant promotions. Importantly, we'll also double down on an approach to sustainability that builds on our rich legacy and company purpose. This includes decades of community relations, corporate responsibility and philanthropic leadership grounded in our 75-year track record of giving 5% of pre-tax profits in the support of vibrant and inclusive communities. \n Our intent is to further use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet, building on the work we've done already to elevate our offering of sustainable brands, to create equity and opportunity in our communities and to help protect the environment. High stakeholder expectations for corporate responsibility only increased in the pandemic and the 2020 demonstrations for social justice. And as we've seen for years, sustainability builds resiliency in our operating model and fuels growth and innovation. So this is work that's important, not just to our guests, our team members, our investors and our communities but to ensuring our business model remains durable for years to come.\n The best predictor of whether we can follow through on our aspiration is a track record of taking care of our team, serving our guests and communities and responsibly growing our business. And to give you a more detailed picture of how we'll continue to do that in the years ahead, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to weigh in. Christina? Thanks, Michael. As we wind down today's event, I'll leave you with a couple of thoughts. 5 years ago, we envisioned a future for ourselves, in which the key to guest preference and breakout growth lay in an unappreciated omnichannel asset called the store. Many were skeptical, which is why we said from the beginning that we were playing our own game and creating a category of one. Many thought the inevitable drift was for our store guests to become digital guests, and that the current only ran in 1 direction.\n We saw something different. We saw a future in which even the most committed digital-only guests would find the best and easiest shopping experience at Target because of how we connect that experience to our stores. We knew that to make our stores function for the future that we envisioned, we'd have to build, acquire and bundle a unique set of capabilities. The technology, the supply chain inventiveness, the physical assets and operations and the team of trusted neighbors that millions turn to for friendly service and a bit of everyday joy.  \n We began to put all those pieces together like no one else had. And the experience was taking hold, on the timetable we expected. Then 2020 accelerated everything. And today, Target is as synonymous with same-day and safety as it is with style and swagger. That is a very strong position to be in.\n And here's where we intend to go with it. First, we'll continue to focus on market share over the long term. We believe our experience, including our fulfillment options, inspiring assortment, ease, safety and personal service will convert more and more consumers into guests. And we'll also work tirelessly to engage established guests across more of our channels and offerings. With new guests choosing Target and established guests engaging with more of our platform, we'll be able to listen to them even more closely. And capabilities like Drive Up, Shipt and Circle will give us a wider window than ever into their preferences. Meaning, we can further improve the experience we provide in the near term, while continuously anticipating where we should go next.  \n Staying closely connected to our guests always points us in the right direction. That's what helped us see a future 5 years ago, that today is a reality. And it's why we're stepping up our investments to drive additional profitable growth. Unlike in recent years, when we needed to shore up our foundation or create new capabilities, today's investments will build on an omnichannel Target platform that is already working incredibly well. A platform that has raised expectations, not just among Target guests, but for consumers across U.S. retail. Few can meet those expectations like we can because what we've created is based on a unique combination of differentiated assets.  \n But this is just the beginning of our story on which we'll continue to iterate, innovate and continuously improve for our guests. So in closing, I want to express my complete confidence in this company's future. I'm confident in our strategy and in our capabilities. And above all, I'm confident in our team. They know that no platform succeeds without purpose. And that our ambitions are always informed by the millions of families we serve. The results we're sharing today and what we envision for the future simply wouldn't be possible without the best team in the business. And I want to thank them once again for all they do for Target, our guests and communities.\n Finally, I want to thank you for joining our Financial Community Meeting. We appreciate your interest in Target, your engagement in our journey and your long-term investment in a growth horizon that we believe will remain bright for years to come. We look forward to hearing from you in the Q&A portion of our program. \n And I'll turn it back to John Hulbert to move us into that discussion. John? Yes. Chris, it's Brian. I think one of the things that we underscored throughout the pandemic has been the strength of our stores. And despite many of Americans really avoiding public places, we've seen very strong store comps, obviously, in excess of 7%. And we saw very solid store traffic. So I think we've continued to build trust. And I think coming out of the pandemic, our stores are going to be -- continue to be very relevant, very important. I think they go far beyond showcasing. We know our guests are inspired by shopping in our stores. They enjoy browsing. They enjoy seeing the combination of our owned brands and national brands. \n And now I think we just punctuate that further with the addition of brands like Ulta Beauty, Levi's, the expansion of Apple. The work that we've done throughout the year to create a showcase of owned brands and national brands and continue to invest in building a trusted and safe shopping experience. So as we think to the future, stores are going to play a very important role. It's going to be a place where our guests enjoy shopping each and every day. And I think they're going to continue to enjoy our multi-category portfolio for years to come. So we are -- continue to be very bullish on the role stores play. And I think these new national brand partnerships will only accentuate the importance of stores and drive future traffic to our stores. Karen, I might as well take the guidance question upfront and kind of remove the bull's eye from Michael's chest, again, no pun intended. But as we sit here today, I think we all recognize this is a very uncertain environment. We're still speculating around what's going to happen with the economy, how employment rates start to recover. While the trends are encouraging right now with the virus, we're all battling COVID each and every day. And while vaccine distribution is accelerating, millions and millions of Americans are still waiting for their turn to get that vaccine. We're still wondering when children go back to school. And when we'll return to the workplace. \n So we approach guidance, recognizing there's lots of uncertainty. But I'll go back to the fact that for most of the last year, we haven't provided guidance, but we have focused on execution. And I think our team has proven to be very flexible, very agile. We responded to the environment and we've been focused on delivering a trusted and safe experience for our guests, whether they're shopping in our stores or online. That focus on execution will continue in 2021. And I wouldn't confuse guidance or the lack thereof with our confidence to continue to take market share and outperform in the coming months and years.\n So I recognize the frustration of not being more precise, particularly on the top line as we think about sales, but I can guarantee you, our entire leadership team and every part of this organization is focused on retaining and growing market share no matter what the variables are we have to face. So I recognize, and we certainly like to be in a different position today, providing more precision. But what I can tell you is we're going to continue to execute our strategy, leverage our capabilities, our owned brands and national brands, our multi-category assortment and our team to continue to build on the momentum we gained in 2020, leverage the additional $15 billion of revenue we now have inside of our P&L and continue to build on the market share we gained in 2020 and make sure that's very sticky for years to come. \n But I recognize for all of you, you'd love more precision around market share. You'd love some more top line insights. I can tell you, we're off to a very strong start in February. In fact, our comps in February started with a 2 handle, and that's a 20 comp in the first part of the year.\n So we'll see how that plays out in March and April, but we're off to a strong start. We took significant market share in the fourth quarter. If you recall our comments in earlier meetings, we talked about the fact that in the first 3 quarters of the year, we had picked up approximately $6 billion of market share. So we added another $3 billion of market share during the holiday season, where all of our competitors were operating. So I think the vibrancy of our model, our ability to execute is something that I would ask all of you to focus in on. And I recognize you've got to do that in light of the fact that we haven't provided the precision that we normally do at this time. Yes. I'll go back over time and think about the work we've been doing for the last 5 or 6 years. We always start by testing and learning. Listening to the guest, listening to our team, iterating along the way, validating our assumptions, both from a sales standpoint and a financial standpoint, before we accelerate. It's the same approach we've taken with remodels over the years and new small formats. It's the same approach we took to Pick Up and Drive Up. And we're doing the same thing as we think about partnerships with great partners like Apple and Ulta Beauty. We want to test and learn, make sure we get the model right. And then as we've demonstrated in the past, we'll hit the accelerator and make sure we expand and leverage scale as quickly as possible. Sure. The biggest factor in '21 was the supply chain and digital pressure, about 110 basis points of pressure on the year from that. But I think that's actually a good place to illustrate somewhat how we think about rate. Because to me, it's all about the dollar impact, not the rate impact. And digital is a perfect example. If you would have told us we could double the digital business and only see 110 basis points of pressure last year, I think we all would have taken that outcome. But more important than that, when we're growing digital, we're deepening our relationship with guests. And great things happen in aggregate to us when that occurs. \n And so sign me up for more digital growth going forward. We know that's a behavior that will be sticky. Because what comes with that, in addition to a little bit of rate pressure on the margin line, is hugely accretive sales benefits in total. And so biggest driver in 2021 for sure and I would welcome more digital growth going forward and we expect that's a place where we'll continue to excel. John, you want to talk about, Shipt? And I'd just go back to a point that we've made a number of times. Our most valuable guest is a guest that uses -- utilizes all of our assets, shops in our stores, leverages Order Pick Up, uses Drive Up when it's convenient for them. And also, more and more, leverages the benefits of a personal shopper through Shipt. So we think that continues to be the easiest place to shop in America. Having all of those assets available for our guests is critically important. And we think those are going to be very sticky over time. Those guests who utilize Drive Up and Shipt during the pandemic, we think there's going to be a lasting connection to those fulfillment options as we go forward in 2021 and beyond. Ed, I'll go back to the commitment we made at this meeting in 2017, when John Mulligan and I laid out our strategy for the company and talked about the billions of dollars of capital we'd invest in stores, in remodeling stores, in building new stores and building out our digital and fulfillment capabilities. At that time, we said the most important investment we were making was in our team. And I think the results we've seen in 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and 2020, is a by-product of that commitment to our team. Investing in wages and benefits, investing in training and career opportunities. And I think it's allowed us to build the best team in retail that's incredibly engaged, that's focused on taking care of our guests, but also taking care of each other. And our team was really the star of 2020. They stepped up during the pandemic and made sure we created a safe shopping environment. \n As we scale Drive Up and saw growth rates of 500% or 600%, they flexed and we're able to meet the needs of the guests. So I think the fact that we've taken a leadership position with wages, invested in our team, provided them the opportunities to grow their careers, that's a hallmark of the commitment we've made at Target to creating the best team in retail. And I think it's provided great returns on investments for shareholders. So we'll continue to make sure we invest in our team. \n To your question around design, the investments we've made in food and beverage, Good & Gather is off to a tremendous start, a multibillion-dollar brand in a short period of time. It's been well received by our guests, great quality, had a great value. And I think it typifies the things we do with our owned brands. And we're very excited about the momentum we had in food and beverage. We took significant market share throughout the year. And the guest has certainly recognized and appreciates the Good & Gather brand. So we think that's a way for us to continue to differentiate our offerings. And as John mentioned, we'll continue to add fresh products to our Drive Up assortment and Pick Up assortment throughout the year, providing our guests access to more of those products that they're looking for each and every day. Scott, I think on fulfillment costs, we continue to make progress on our fulfillment costs through 2 paths. First is each individual fulfillment service, we continue to lower the absolute cost of providing it. So Order Pick Up today, Drive Up today, Shipt today, ship-from-store, all of those are cheaper than they were 2 years ago. So we continue to see our costs come down there. \n The second way we see our costs come down is through mix. Drive Up, Order Pick Up and Shipt all have much better economics, as we've said for years than shipping from the back of our stores, which also has better economics than shipping from our fulfillment centers. So we -- and they are the fastest-growing portion of our portfolio. In addition to that, ship-from-store grows much faster than fulfillment. So we see favorable mix as well. So we continue to be really pleased with the progress we're making on the unit economics of shipping or delivering goods, fulfilling goods to our guests.\n The only thing I might add to that is, I mean, John talked about the power of having stores hit the hub of that fulfillment equation, and that helps all those marginal economics. But also important not to forget is the thing that matters most economically with digital is the growth in guest spend in total as they become those omnichannel guests that have a deeper relationship with Target overall. \n And so any time we're looking at the slice and dicing of the P&L by channel, which we do a lot of, and we've made a lot of progress getting more efficient over time, that always has to be stapled to the greater impact of that greater guest spend in total as they use more and more of our digital fulfillment services. \n Scott, one of the examples we've shared over the last year is the Target guest that is now using Drive Up, actually spends more money in store. It just deepens that relationship. So we can look at the economics, fulfillment node by fulfillment node, but it's really how it all comes together and how we deepen relationship with our guests, get them to use all of our assets and utilize both stores and digital fulfillment channels over time. So as John said, we're going to continue to improve the economics of each one of those capabilities but it's really the sum of the parts and that deeper relationship we build as our guests use more of our fulfillment nodes over time. Scott, the place I'd start is the power that the store gives us to fulfill because everything is cheaper when it comes to the store. And that helps us on the cost question that you asked. It's cheaper to ship a box a shorter distance from a local store after it's ridden our supply chain rails all the way to that store. Same-day fulfillment economics look a lot like store economics to us. And that's the piece to John's point that's growing fastest. And so the stores give us an incredible advantage to have advantaged cost profile as we fulfill. \n The other thing that the stores give us that has been incredibly valuable this year is great flexibility. We've seen the ability for stores to scale to meet guests' need in a way that I think probably would have surprised us if we can go back a year in time and see it all coming. But stores are so flexible. There's real power in being able to say, it's that same piece of inventories sitting on a shelf, and we can put it in a box and ship it out the back. We can drop it in a guest's trunk via a Drive Up. They can place it in their cart on a store trip and not having to be able to see perfectly exactly how that demand is going to come, but knowing the inventory can fulfill it and our great store team can make it happen however the guest chooses to shop gives us a huge flexibility advantage as well. Thanks for the question, Simeon. When I think about margins in the long run, the straw that will stir that drink is sales growth. And we're incredibly confident in the way we're positioned to build on the deepening guest trust the beginning of this year with long-term sales growth. You can see the power of leverage in our model in an exaggerated way in 2020, no doubt. But that's the focus of where we're investing going forward is to continue to gain share and grow the top line because that gives us a lot of levers to pull below there on the margin line. Yes. \n So the other thing that we've talked about periodically is the importance of mix in our business. And over time, our multi-category portfolio is a huge asset. Christina has been obviously in a merchant chair for a number of years and understands the importance of balancing our multi-category portfolio, the balance between our owned brands and national brands. And as John and Michael have talked about periodically, as we think about the future from a digital standpoint, we think that's going to continue to move more and more towards same-day, which from a mix standpoint is very advantageous to us. So I think our outlook for margin over the long-term is very bullish. \n As we leverage our multi-category portfolio, we continue to build our owned brands as well as great national brand partners. But as we continue to see guests take advantage of the speed and convenience of same-day digital fulfillment, all those things add up to a very healthy mix management and margin control. Simeon, I'll come back to -- we saw a really strong share performance against our entire portfolio in 2020. And that continued in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to be in a strong share position in 2021. Obviously, we're still sorting through what the overall industry performance will look like, category by category as we think about 2021. But I'll let Christina comment on some of the early observations that we have as we think about the strength in our owned brands, some of the newness that we're bringing to market, the new national brand partnerships and the great investments we have with both our owned brand and national brand vendor partners. So I think we're well positioned to continue to grow share. And I think the investments we're making in our stores and the store experience and in digital positions us well to continue to grow share for years to come. Yes. We've spent a lot of time trying to sort through some of the factors behind that. Again, I think so much of it has been the investments we've made in safety and the shopping experience throughout the last year. We certainly have seen guests shop all of our categories in the month of February. So broad-based strength. And I think, again, the guest is responding to some of the newness in our assortment. And to Christina's point, they're looking for the opportunity to shop our stores and find new items. They're tired of the yoga pants and really appreciate some of the new assortment we have in apparel. They're still shopping for their homes as they refresh the core. They're still heating at home so kitchen and food-related items are still really important. \n So we see a guest shopping all of our categories, taking advantage of both stores and our digital channels. And I think it's a byproduct of the investments we've made throughout the pandemic to build trust to make sure they know we've got a safe shopping environment and the great work that our teams have done to make sure that they're focused every day on meeting the needs to our guests. So very encouraged with the month of February. And we'll continue to make sure we stay agile and flexible to meet the needs of the guests throughout the next 11 months. Christina? And Corey, an opportunity to really thank our vendor partners who have been very responsive to meeting our needs. Obviously, no one anticipated the kind of comps we were driving in 2020. I talked about the almost historic number we delivered in January, and our vendor partners have been very responsive, working with our merchants and supply chain teams to ensure that we fill in some of those gaps and have the inventory we need as we go forward. Yes. Paul, the only other point I would add is, as we've looked at the guests during the pandemic, we know they're consolidating where they shop. And we may have had a Target guest that was shopping for home or beauty, but they're now shopping for apparel, picking up food and beverage, exploring new categories. They may be coming to us for electronics and toys. So to Michael's point, while most of America shops with Target, during the pandemic, we've seen consumers consolidate the number of places where they shop. They're now experiencing and are active in more categories, and we think that provides lasting benefits for us for years to come.\n Operator, it looks like we've got time for one final question today. Joe, obviously, it's been a big area of focus for us for many years. And I'll come back to something we haven't talked about a lot today, which is the membership within Target Circle. The fact that we now have 90 million members in Target Circle, which gives us an understanding of their needs, their wants, how they're shopping, new categories and new items we can introduce them to. So we're going to continue to make sure we leverage Target Circle to build deeper relationships, introduce that guest to new categories, new fulfillment options. And over time, we think that's a very valuable asset that will continue to drive growth, help us build market share and continue the momentum that we established in 2020. \n So with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing all of you in person in 2022. And obviously, John and Michael will be available for any follow-up questions today or over the balance of the week. \n So thank you for joining us, and stay well."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "All I can say is wow. Those news clips paint a vivid picture of the roller coaster our team and our business experienced throughout 2020. All in all, it was a standout year in which everything we've spent years developing and building came together to serve our guests like never before. \n So today, after a year of record growth, I want to start my remarks by expanding on a point Brian mentioned earlier because investors often want to know, how much of Target's growth is being driven by specific strategies or specific assets? For example, they want to know if we can isolate how much of our growth is coming from Drive Up, from digital and total, our owned brand work, remodel program and any other way we can slice and dice the data. And I understand the impulse. Our internal team often wants to do the same thing. And of course, as a self described data geek, I'm inclined to think the same way.\n But then I see data like we first shared with you last year. Guests who tried Drive Up for the first time spend about 30% more on average compared with before, including an increase in conventional store shopping. And we see a similar change in behavior among guests who try Shipt for the first time. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of Drive Up and Shipt go far beyond the value of an individual trip. They're both capabilities that drive guest affinity, creating value that extends well beyond the services themselves.\n That same thinking applies to our merchandise categories. If you focus only on the amount of sales or growth by category, you can miss how they all work together to drive guest affinity. I see how this plays out with my own family. Over the next few months, the cold weather in Minnesota will finally end, and my kids will need warm weather clothes. On the next Saturday morning Target run, we'll shop for those clothes, and we'll also pick up some food, a few office supplies, laundry detergent and maybe a prescription from CVS. We might wander over and purchase some spring decor. And we'll probably need some more earbuds since the kids seem to be inventing new ways to lose or destroy them. And on our way out, we'll probably stop at the Starbucks near the entrance so my wife and I can enjoy a coffee on the way home. \n So now if you're going to analyze that basket, is there a way to know which category drove the trip? And beyond the basket itself, shouldn't we broaden the analysis even further since that trip depended on a conveniently located store that's clean, safe and fun to shop, featuring low everyday prices and a friendly and engaged team?\n Over time, I've come to understand that guest engagement and financial performance are driven by everything we're doing at the same time, not any factor in isolation. Among the critical factors, of course, there are the tangible assets that show up on our balance sheet, including our stores, distribution centers and technology, but the list goes way beyond the balance sheet and includes our team, our reputation and the trust we've established with multiple stakeholders, which only deepened in 2020. Then there's the Target brand itself. Our owned and exclusive brands, capabilities like marketing, merchandising, product design and development, sourcing and so much more. And of course, there's our culture, our mission and our values, which helped to unify a diverse and widely dispersed team in support of a common purpose. \n So what's the key to our future performance? It's our continued investments in the assets and capabilities, both tangible and intangible, that we can build and integrate to drive guest engagement and growth. And how should we determine what to focus on? The answer comes from continually listening carefully to our guests. The better we know them, the more effectively we can invest in what they want and develop new ways to deliver joy and inspiration while making their lives easier. If we invest the right way, guests will reward us with more engagement and growth, which in turn will create additional opportunities to invest.  \n Our success in 2020, which was years in the making, is a perfect example. It started many years ago as we engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of our business, our strategy and took a deep dive into the wants and needs of our guests. That work led to a new strategic focus, followed by years of investment of both capital and expense to roll out new fulfillment capabilities, rejuvenated stores and brands, a modern store operating model and more. Through that work, we built the foundation that allowed our team to deliver unprecedented results in the face of a rapidly changing landscape in 2020.  \n So this year, our focus is to lock in last year's gains, build on that foundation, continue to deepen guest engagement and drive long-term growth. And following last year's growth of $15 billion, more than we grew over the prior 11 years combined, we're entering 2021 as a much larger company with a host of opportunities to build on last year's success.  \n Digital is one of those opportunities. As John mentioned, in 2020, the penetration of digital sales advanced many years in a single year. With COVID as the catalyst, guests who had never tried our digital services quickly changed their habits and tried them sooner than they would have otherwise. We've long told you that, on average, a multichannel guest spends nearly 4x as much as a store-only guest and nearly 10x more than a digital-only guest. Now just in case there are any stats majors listening, that's a statement about correlation, not causation. So I'm not saying that a guest spending immediately changes that much after they move into a new channel. \n Even so, these averages help us to understand how deepening engagement translates to a more valuable guest relationship. And last year, Target gained an additional 12 million multichannel guests. Of course, a portion of those guests were completely new to Target, but the vast majority had previously shopped with us, but only in a single channel. The opportunity this year is to build on our now deeper relationship with these guests as we engage with them more frequently and help them migrate toward the much higher average spend we see from our multichannel guests over time.\n And today, even though we already have an unmatched suite of digital fulfillment options, there's more we can do for our guests. One way is to continue expanding the assortment of fresh, refrigerated and frozen food items available for Pick Up and Drive Up. When we study the behavior of guests who first shopped for these items through one of these services last year, we saw an average increase in shopping frequency of about 1 visit per month compared with the control group. On average, these guests increase their food and beverage spending between 20% and 30%. And importantly, spend about 20% more in other categories. \n As you heard from Christina, we also have an opportunity to continue developing and launching new owned brands while we become an increasingly attractive partner for leading national brands. In the years ahead, we'll likely have many more partnership opportunities. And given our strong performance and financial position, can be very thoughtful in approaching every one of them. This begins by ensuring the partnership is right for our guests and that the partner and financial arrangement are appropriate long-term choices for our business. \n And of course, there's a huge opportunity to create value through Target Circle, which has grown in less than 2 years to include more than 90 million members. Circle is easy and free to join and members enjoy rewards that drive engagement directly, which we can measure by the increase in spending among guests who joined. But the value of Circle only begins there because it also helps us to gain an ongoing, deeper understanding of our guests and their changing preferences, helping us to connect them with the services, brands and categories that address those wants and needs.\n So it's clear that we're entering 2021 with a lot of momentum and a really strong foundation with a lot more room to grow. As you heard from John, we still have a long runway to expand the available assortment for our same-day services, while we invest to broaden Shipt's reach by entering new markets while expanding in existing ones. When we acquired Shipt in late 2017, we were confident that same-day delivery was a capability every successful retailer would need to have, and we've spent the last 3 years integrating Shipt into our strategy and operations. At the same time, the acquisition has made it easier for Shipt to grow and achieve scale in new markets, given the volume that Target immediately brings to the platform. \n And as John covered, we're investing to modernize our network and add replenishment capacity to support future growth. Obviously, we came into last year with a great deal of capacity, but we used up a lot more of it than expected. Here's one way to think about it. At our current average sales per store, last year's growth of $15 billion was equivalent to the addition of more than 300 new Target stores. If we had actually opened that many new locations, we'd have needed some additional upstream capacity, and that need is the same, whether growth is coming from a bigger store footprint or higher productivity in our existing footage.\n While I'm on the topic, I want to pause and address the question of whether our stores are going to run out of capacity to grow digital sales. And I'd start with what John mentioned earlier, how our top quartile of stores demonstrate the continued potential for our average stores to handle more throughput. But I want to drill down into a really specific example to provide another view of our untapped capacity. And what we can do when an individual location reaches its limit. To do that, I'm going to go way back in history and talk about our experience at the Target store in Colma, California, part of the San Francisco market.  \n 20 years ago, Colma had grown to be our second highest volume store in the chain, generating more than $90 million in annual sales, nearly 3x our chain average at the time. Given its extreme volume, we suspected the store was running out of capacity, which was limiting its ability to grow. So when the site of a former Montgomery Ward's became available just across the highway in Daly City, we decided to buy it and build a new Target. This was unheard of in our history, building a new store less than a mile away from an existing one, and it was a calculated risk because the new store would only make sense if it drove incremental volume. And that's exactly what happened. The combined sales of the 2 stores quickly grew far beyond what the single store was able to generate. And today, each of those locations is in the top 5% of our stores based on sales volume.\n So let's come back to today. Last year, our stores fulfilled more than 95% of our total sales, which works out to an average of about $47 million in fulfilled sales per store. That means our average store today is fulfilling about half of what the Colma store was already supporting 20 years ago. This offers another clear window into the growth potential of our average store today. But will there sometimes be extreme examples of stores that hit their capacity? I hope so because we know what to do when that happens. If we have a viable real estate opportunity nearby, we can invest in another one of these modern multichannel assets we happen to call a Target store. To be clear, based on what we see today, we don't expect a lot of these opportunities over the next few years, but I'd love to be wrong about that since we'd likely generate strong returns on the new stores we could open in those markets. In the meantime, we continue to make productive investments in new small format stores, and we're eager to begin ramping up our remodel program in 2021 and beyond. \n So with all these options to generate profitable growth, we're in a position to play offense and lean into the opportunity to build on last year's momentum. As such, we're planning for annual CapEx in the $4 billion range in each of the next few years to support remodels, new stores and supply chain projects to add replenishment capacity and modernize the network, including sortation centers. Beyond full store remodels, we'll also invest in Ulta Beauty shop in shops, while optimizing front end space in our highest volume locations, increasing the efficiency of our Pick Up and Drive Up services.\n So now this is the section of my remarks in which you typically expect me to cover our P&L expectations for the year. But today, given the high level of uncertainty we continue to face, providing a lot of guidance would be an exercise on false precision. Instead, I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the most important factors affecting our near-term plans as we maintain our laser focus on investing for the long term.\n So first, as I think about implications for Target's top line in the months and years ahead, I think about the drivers at 3 levels of a funnel. At the widest part of the funnel are macro factors, including uncertainty about the path of COVID-19 and the speed and effectiveness of the vaccine campaign. How consumer attitudes and behaviors will evolve as we emerge from the pandemic. For example, there's an emerging consensus that the nature of work will permanently change as employers move to a more flexible model and allow for more work from home. This will likely have long-lasting implications for consumer spending. And finally, beyond changes in the consumer mindset, macro considerations include the health of the economy, the near-term impact of stimulus and how quickly various industries and communities will recover from the pandemic. \n The middle stage of the funnel involves questions around potential industry trends in each of the categories we sell and every industry has its own story. And categories consumed mostly at home, including food and beverage, essentials, home and hardlines, industry trends have accelerated over the last year and could see some softness as we emerge from the crisis. However, the timing and extent is hard to predict and could be offset by permanent changes in consumer habits, including a higher percentage of work time spent at home and an elevated focus on cleanliness and health resulting from the pandemic.\n In the beauty and apparel industries, which experienced softness in 2020, trends are expected to improve over time. Specifically, as people resume working in offices, attending concerts, movies and sporting events, traveling and eating out, they're likely to focus more on their appearance and spend more on these categories than they did in 2020. But let's be clear. These are just quick high-level thoughts on potential industry trends and they're far from ironclad predictions. \n So as we move to the bottom of the funnel and think about how those trends are likely to play out at Target, we first need to think about market share within those industries and on the topic of share, we have a lot of confidence as we look ahead. In 2020, Target saw unprecedented share gains across all 5 of our core merchandise categories. Importantly, these gains were not limited to the categories in which others were forced to close, and they stayed remarkably consistent throughout the year and across the country. Based on this experience and our investment focus going forward, we're optimistic about our opportunity to lock in recent share gains and deliver long-term growth on top of the foundation we've already established.\n So now I want to move beyond the top line and illustrate how we're thinking about other lines on the P&L for the year. And in this discussion, beyond prior year comparisons, I will often be looking back to 2019, since that year provides a more stable baseline compared with the extreme volatility we encountered in 2020. Let's start with our gross margin line, where in 2020, we experienced large but offsetting variances related to specific factors. The first was supply chain and digital fulfillment costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure last year. While that headwind was notable, it was less than I believe most of us would have expected, given that we saw $10 billion of digital sales growth, accounting for 2/3 of our total growth. As we look ahead to this year and beyond, we expect to see a smaller amount of pressure from supply chain and digital fulfillment, given that digital growth is likely to moderate, and we continue to make progress in reducing average unit fulfillment costs. \n A second headwind to last year's gross margin rate was category mix as lower margin categories grew faster than our higher-margin categories, accounting for about 90 basis points of rate pressure. At a minimum this year, we expect category mix to exert less pressure than last year. And notably, it could easily become a tailwind like it was in prior years. However, our crystal ball is not nearly clear enough today to predict this year's category mix with any precision.\n The third factor in last year's gross margin performance was our merchandising decisions, which include our pricing, mix of owned and national brands and the magnitude of our promotional and clearance markdowns. In 2020, the combination of these factors provided a significant tailwind of about 150 basis points, driven primarily by favorability and markdowns. A portion of this favorability was related to promotions, but the biggest single factor was a significant decline in clearance markdown rates as demand in seasonal and other clearance sensitive categories far outpaced our expectations. In 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from these abnormally low levels, which will create some gross margin pressure compared with 2020. So how do these expectations come together in 2021? As we consider the range of expectations for the combined impact of these 3 drivers, we believe that our 2021 gross margin rate will remain somewhat lower than our 2019 gross margin rate of 28.9%.\n On the SG&A expense line this year, we'll be annualizing last year's significant investments in safety measures and team member pay and benefits. We'll also be annualizing the fixed cost and other scale benefits we realized throughout the year. Looking ahead, given that we're focused on locking in last year's gains, we expect to retain significant scale benefits compared with 2019. In addition, we expect to deliver continued efficiency improvements, driven by investments in our supply chain, technology and operating model, which will help to offset continued investments in our team. Altogether, we expect that our 2021 SG&A expense rate will also be lower than our 2019 rate of 20.8%. \n On the D&A expense line, we expect to see moderate dollar growth in 2021 as we ramp up remodels and accelerate depreciation on the assets we replace. Of course, rate performance will depend on the total sales we deliver this year.  \n So as we consider how all of these rates come together on the operating margin line, we're facing a wide range of possibilities as we enter the year. I've already talked about the unpredictability of sales and how category and channel mix alone can impact our margin. But even with that uncertainty, we should continue to benefit from the leverage we gained in 2020. Altogether, our expectation is that this year's operating margin rate will move down from the 7% we recorded in 2020 but remain above our 2019 operating margin rate of 6%, with the most likely outcome in the lower half of that range. \n So now for those of you hoping we provide a more precise view of our expectations today, I want you to know that I feel the same way. I know that it's difficult to model our business right now. Our team is facing the same challenge. In the face of this uncertainty, we continue to put a huge premium on flexibility and agility, which served us extremely well throughout 2020. After all, flexibility is a cornerstone of our business model, which features a uniquely diverse category mix and a store-based fulfillment model that can quickly adapt to changes in guest shopping patterns. With the benefit of this model, an outstanding team and a strong balance sheet, we're perfectly positioned to navigate any near term uncertainty, while we continue to invest in long-term growth. And while it may sound counterintuitive, our expectations for the next few quarters feel cloudier than our view of the longer term, when we're highly confident in our ability to grow profitably and build on recent share gains.\n So now before I move beyond the P&L, I want to spend a minute talking about the prior year comparisons we're facing in the first 2 quarters of this year. As you'll recall, in the first quarter last year, sales accelerated meaningfully after the onset of COVID, but our gross margin rate for the quarter declined an astounding amount, more than 4 percentage points in light of the cost to rightsize our apparel inventory.\n Also in the first quarter, we began making meaningful investments in the health and safety of our team and guests, which we'd maintained throughout the year. Altogether, our first quarter earnings per share were down more than 60% compared with 2019. Contrast that with the second quarter last year when our comp sales grew more than 24%, our gross margin rate also increased and we saw a jaw dropping amount of leverage on the SG&A and D&A expense lines, which more than offset investments in team and guest safety. As a result, last year's second quarter EPS grew more than 80% compared with 2019. That's a swing of more than 140 percentage points in our EPS growth rates between Q1 and Q2 last year.\n So as we plan and analyze our performance in the first 2 quarters of 2021, we're going to lean heavily on comparisons to the much more stable environment we experienced in 2019. This will help all of us to look through the extreme volatility and year-over-year comparisons we'll be seeing throughout the first half of this year. \n So now let's move beyond the P&L and turn to cash and capital deployment, and I want to reiterate that our priorities remain the same as they have been for decades. First, we look to invest in the business and all of the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. One note, if we attain that goal in 2021, it will mark our 50th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend increases, putting us in a very small group of companies who can make that statement. And finally, we look to deploy excess cash through share repurchases only after we fully supported the first 2 goals within the capacity of our middle A credit ratings.\n As you know, last year turned out to be a very strong year for cash flow in light of our sales growth and strong operational performance. As a result, we ended the year with about $8.5 billion of cash, well beyond the amount we'd maintain in ordinary times. But as strong as our year turned out to be, we can't forget the volatility we just encountered and the environment today remains far from ordinary. It's in that context that we evaluate our 2021 capital deployment expectations.\n Regarding CapEx, I already outlined our plan to invest about $4 billion this year. Regarding the dividend, later this year, we expect to recommend that our Board approve a robust increase in the per share dividend. But as always, this recommendation will depend on how our business is performing. Beyond those priorities, we've resumed share repurchases this year. And depending on how the virus, the economy and our performance progresses, could have ample capacity within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\n But I will quickly say, we'll continue to be cautious and maintain an ample amount of liquidity to carry us through a wide range of near-term scenarios. As such, it may be a multiyear journey before our credit metrics move fully back to historical levels, depending on the speed with which we see more normal volatility across the economy and our business.\n So now I want to turn to our after-tax ROIC. As we've long emphasized, we rely on this metric to assess the health of our business and the effectiveness of our capital deployment over time. However, as is often the case, we sometimes need to look past near-term volatility and 2020 presents a great example. That's because last year, we delivered an astounding aftertax ROIC of 23.5%, up more than 7 percentage points from already strong performance in 2019. While this outcome is remarkable and a testament to our team and operating model, I'm going to quickly say that it's artificially high and likely to come back down over time. That might sound like a strange thing to say, but it's based on a number of factors that are clear today. \n First, with unexpectedly strong sales, our inventory turns shot up last year, and we saw abnormally high payables leverage. While that had a positive near-term impact on working capital, we also saw really choppy in stocks, which isn't how we want to operate under normal conditions. In 2021, we're planning for full shelves and better in stocks, which will bring inventory turns and payables leverage back down to more sustainable levels. This will require a net investment of working capital for the year. \n Similarly, as I mentioned earlier, we're leaning in to support a strong set of growth opportunities over the next few years. As we accelerate investment in stores, supply chain modernization and replenishment capacity in support of those growth prospects, we'll likely see an increase in the invested capital portion of this metric over the next few years. Bottom line, while I believe this metric will stay very healthy and compare favorably to other retailers, I expect it will move back down into the 20% range over time. This would represent very strong absolute and relative performance on a larger asset base than we've maintained in the past. \n So as I get ready to turn things back over to Brian. I want to take you back to this meeting 4 years ago, when I was listening from my headquarters in Minneapolis. During my career at Target, I've been lucky to spend time working with our stores, and I've developed a deep appreciation for the value they can deliver. So when Brian and John stood up and said we'd be investing to put our stores at the center of everything we do, including both digital and physical shopping, I had a ton of confidence in that plan. It was a plan based on carefully listening to our guests, it was differentiated and we were fortunate to have the necessary resources to get there.\n In the years following that meeting, our team worked hard, and we encountered many doubters but we continued to invest with a long view and last year's results showed the value of that focus. And as we sit here today, we remain committed to making future investments with that same long view. Rather than sitting back, taking a break and waiting for the virus to subside, we are focused on playing offense and investing in continued growth. \n And just like 4 years ago, my confidence in the future starts with the team. So I want to acknowledge everyone on the Target team, from headquarters to our distribution centers, to our stores in all 50 states and our offices around the world for their dedication to our guests and passion for taking care of each other. Without you, we couldn't have delivered such an amazing amount of value on behalf of our stakeholders in 2020. And with your help, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders in the years ahead. I can't say it enough. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \n Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Sure. I can take that one first, Chris. When you think about [ SG&A ] through the year, we'll be annualizing the move to $15, and there'll be some onetime things that don't repeat. You think about buying plexiglass dividers, you only do that once. The final story in SG&A will be written by what our sales outcome looks like too. But we've got a lot of levers within the model to continue to bend the cost curves in a direction we like throughout SG&A, the benefit of the volume growth that we've seen is that, that helps us get more and more efficient on how we fulfill that volume. No, I wouldn't think about it that way necessarily. With the SG&A, we expect that our SG&A rate will be lower than 2019's rate, and that's a benefit of the significant scale that we've gained since then. If you zoom out, I think there's going to be a lot of movement between the different levers within margin and SG&A. And so that's why we've tried to give some of our best thinking on operating rate in total. And so a wide range. Not every meeting I would sit here and be describing a 1 point gap in operating margin between the incredibly strong 6 that we had in 2019 and the 7 we just put up. And that whole range is in play. I think it's slightly more likely we're in the bottom half of that range when all the dust settles in the top half, but we're going to have a lot to learn throughout the year based on where we ultimately land. Karen, like similar to the answer I gave, Chris, I think there's going to be a lot of moving variables through the gross margin and SG&A lines. And to get overly precise today about where any one of them comes in, I think, would be a bit of an exercise in false precision. The biggest factor versus a couple of years ago on the SG&A line is going to be the benefit of scale, and we can put that to use in so many ways across the business. And we've got a long history of investing in our team. That was a big part of the journey we embarked on in 2017 and attracting and retaining the best team in retail has been a center of our strategy for the last several years. And we continue to put the team at the forefront this year, and that will continue as well. Sure. I can start. Thanks for the question, Paul. As we think about new customers, no doubt, there are some new customers to Target this year. We've shared some of the digital guests that we've gained in past calls. The thing that we're most focused on is deepening the relationship of those guests that have really stepped up their trust and their spend and their share of wallet with Target over the last year. And so we talked about the 12 million new omnichannel guests this year. That's the place where we focused a lot of that kind of deepening of the guest relationship and the things that we're tracking. We're encouraged to see the stickiness of a lot of the new behaviors that were tried in 2020. \n So things like Drive Up, thanks to the incredible experience our store teams provide. Once guests try a service like that, they come back and we've seen higher rates of stickiness this year than historically for some of those digital fulfillment services. And that bodes well for the stickiness of those guests and those behaviors going forward. And so while we do watch new guests, and it's great to get a new guest and convert them to a deeper Target guests over time, a lot of America shops Target and it's the deepening of those existing guests as they shop us in new and different ways and more often, that's our focus."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. It's great to be joining all of you today, and I'm really excited to discuss how our teams have differentiated Target in the marketplace and some of the potential we see in front of us. Now I should mention upfront that I joined Target back in 2003. Since then, I've held a number of roles across merchandising. Over that time, I've seen a lot in our business, ups and downs, good years and rebuilding years, economic booms and a great recession. But I've never seen anything like last year. Of course, COVID-19 is an unprecedented event, challenging our team and our guests in ways we never could have imagined. But how we responded at Target, empowering our teams, moving quickly and leveraging the power of our multi-category assortment, that's Target at its best. In fact, that's Target better than I've ever seen us. \n So when I think about my new role in bringing together insight, strategy and innovation, plus planning, design, sourcing and buying functions, it's not about fixing anything, it's about improving on what worked so well last year. It's about keeping Target relevant by staying ahead of what our guests need and it's about positioning Target to drive growth in 2021 and for years to come. We were successful last year because we gave our guests a lot of reasons to be confident in shopping at Target. The work of our frontline teams to keep our stores safe and clean has made Target a destination, a happy place as our guests limit other trips out of their homes. \n Our suite of same-day fulfillment options was a game changer, driving triple-digit growth in our digital sales. And regardless of whether our guests were strolling our aisles or scrolling on our app, we struck that balance between replenishment and discovery. Through the breadth of our assortment, along with a single view of inventory and teams leading across all channels, we were able to move with speed and agility, meeting guest needs despite the fastest changing environment we've ever faced. \n A lot of you probably saw this last spring in observing our business or in your own lives. In the space of just a few weeks at the outbreak of the pandemic, guests stocked up on food, beverages and essentials. Then they turned to us for help in converting kitchen tables into classroom space and spare bedrooms into home offices. And then they look to Target for fitness gear, games and other entertainment as they settled in for the long haul. That kind of volatility continued throughout 2020. In fact, one of the only constants last year was that no matter what happened, our guests turned to Target for help to meet functional needs to get through the pandemic and for inspiration and joy, especially around those key seasonal moments that took on added importance for so many people last year. \n So we never looked at our business from the perspective of a particular category. Instead, we shaped our business decisions around what was happening in the world. That's something we'll continue to guide us. Because when we focus on what's happening in the lives of our guests, it's obvious what categories we need to flex to keep building on the trust they placed in Target. Our multi-category assortment is a competitive advantage because it keeps Target relevant no matter what. But how we manage that assortment, the premium we place on curation, partnerships and product design and development, that's what differentiates Target. \n Brian touched briefly on our billion and multibillion-dollar owned brands. Our owned brand portfolio, which spans all categories, is vital to the success of our business. It represents about 1/3 of our total sales and even more of our gross margin, which helps to sustain key enterprise investments. And Target's owned brands continue to generate strong growth because of our approach to creating, designing and maintaining these brands. They're not just private labels, they're brands our guests trust, they're brands our guests love. \n A great example of this is in the athleisure space. Even before athleisure became work-from-home apparel, this was a hot category, and it was an area where we had room to raise our game. So early in 2020, we launched All in Motion. And last month, it became a $1 billion brand. That didn't happen by chance. We were able to respond to this trend quickly and build a beloved brand because we invested in co-creating this brand with our guests. Our team talked to 15,000 people, we consulted with 65 fitness pros and we had team members attend dozens of workout classes with our guests. That's the kind of work we put into owned brands across our assortment in every category. So whether it's sweating through a spin class or talking to parents and kids about how Cat & Jack can meet their needs or taste testing every recipe in our Good & Gather assortment before we launch, we go the extra mile, resulting in brands our guests don't just buy because we offer them at a good price, but instead, brands they love, brands that are the reason why they're shopping at Target in the first place. \n And that work continues. This year, we'll announce and launch several new owned brands in areas where we know Target can make a difference for our guests. This focus on making Target irresistible through our products and our experience also applies to how we work with our national brand partners. And it's an approach that has made targeted place where national brands thrive. You've heard about Levi's, including the limited time Home Collection that just set and the Ulta Beauty at Target shops we're adding to our stores and target.com this year. Those are great examples of what Target represents for our partners. Levi's is an iconic brand that, for a long time, have thrived largely in department store environments. But as they began exploring new platforms, they turned to Target. And Ulta Beauty is an incredible leader in specialty beauty. Through our new partnership, we'll provide access to brands we know our guests love, but previously had to go elsewhere to get. \n This kind of work is a big part of what makes Target special, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, in fact, we began rolling out a dedicated Apple experience, starting in 17 stores across the country and online. We're doubling the Apple footprint in these stores with new lighting fixtures and displays for Apple products, including an extended assortment of accessories. We have a new dedicated Apple landing page on our digital channels and we'll offer our guests more expertise with Apple train team members in these stores and enhanced product videos on our app and website. This is really exciting because we're taking the work we've done with Apple over the last 15 years and making it even better. \n Finally, I want to touch on a body of work that's incredibly important. The efforts underway to make Target more relevant and more welcoming for black guests. Over the last few years, we've listened carefully to our multicultural guests as a whole, and we recognized there was an opportunity to do more for black guests. So we've added more brands and products that we know they love. A great example is what we've done in the beauty space with 50 black-owned and black-founded brands now available in our industry-leading assortment. But we're committed to doing even more in key categories through our owned brands and partnerships, building on our progress to ensure that we're delivering on our purpose of helping all families discover the joy of everyday life. \n The retail landscape is never static. So the retailers that will win are the ones that have a durable business model, something we've built at Target. But just as important, the retailers that will be best positioned for the future are the ones with the closest connection to their customers and the ability to flex to meet their changing needs. That was critical to Target's success last year. And that obsession with listening to our guests, understanding the things that are shaping their world and meeting their needs for convenience and ease, inspiration and discovery across all channels is what has Target poised for continued growth in the years ahead. \n Thank you. And now I'll hand the meeting over to John. Yes. I might add a few points there, but to really punctuate what Brian said is the multi-category portfolio that we have gives us so much flexibility. And if we follow the guest, we will deliver. We -- when the guests chose not to really change their order very much and more yield pass all year, it had an impact on the apparel industry, yet we significantly outpaced the performance in that industry. This year, people are going to buy new clothes because people don't want to wear the same thing over and over. They'll do their makeup. They might even buy a piece of luggage if they're venturing out of the trip. And that ability to flex with the needs of the guests through the breadth of our portfolio is what's going to keep us growing share and gaining against the industry for years to come. We're very pleased with our inventory position. We continue to build in support of sales. And the reality is that we are -- we're looking to fill in the gaps where we have a few selectively, but it's been a marked improvement throughout the year and the responsiveness of our team is incredible. We have not only a very responsible supply chain team here in the United States, but across the whole world. That intel and insight allows us to manage a very complex supply chain with efficiency and always been focused on getting our out of stocks in the best position possible."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation third quarter earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 18, 2020.  \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. \n In a few moments, Brian, John and Michael will provide their perspective on the third quarter and our priorities as we move into the holiday season. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.  \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder,  any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings.  \n Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and our focus going forward. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I move to our third quarter results, I want to acknowledge our team. In an incredibly challenging environment, they have stayed focused on our guests, looked out for each other and built on the purpose and a clear set of priorities we've had in place for several years, making Target an even more relevant and responsive company for the millions of families we serve every week.  \n The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us, and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. They've stayed laser-focused on safety, agility and reliability as they seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and shopping patterns. They've handled supply constraints in essential categories while chasing inventory in long lead time categories that are experiencing explosive growth. They've been a calming presence and a friendly face to our guests, who are craving normalcy at a time when hardly anything feels that way.  \n And our team members have passionately played an active, positive role in our communities during an incredibly turbulent year. With a deepening level of trust our guests are placing in our team and our brand, we've continued to see very strong business results. \n Third quarter sales grew nearly $4 billion over last year, bringing our year-to-date growth to more than $10 billion. This unprecedented growth, both in the quarter and the year, has been driven by meaningful share gains across every one of our core categories as guests increasingly rely on Target to reliably and safely serve their wants and needs.  \n Based on the cost leverage driven by steeply higher sales, our business continued to deliver impressive bottom line performance despite the outside investments we have been making in our team, safety and digital fulfillment. \n Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.79 established another record high for company and was up more than 100% from last year. \n Third quarter comparable sales increased 20.7%, reflecting a 4.5% traffic growth, combined with an increase in average ticket of more than 15%.  \n Since the pandemic began in March, we've experienced a meaningful acceleration in basket growth, both in stores and online, as guests have consolidated their shopping into much larger trips. Across channels, our store comps grew nearly 10% while our digital comp sales grew 155%, contributing nearly 11 percentage points to the company comp.  \n Within digital, we continued to see the strongest growth in our same-day services, Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt, which, together, grew more than 200% in the quarter. These services are fast, convenient, reliable and contactless, which explains why they continue to generate very high levels of guest satisfaction. All our financial reporting counts these same-day orders as digital. These services are entirely enabled by our stores. Specifically, same-day orders are fulfilled by our store teams, along with Shipt shoppers, who rely on store inventory and systems to deliver to the front of our stores, our parking lots or guest front doors within a couple of hours receiving an order.  \n Beyond same-day services, well over half of our packages we ship to guest homes are also fulfilled from our stores, providing speed to our guests while reducing shipping costs on our P&L. \n Altogether, between same-day services and packages shipped to our guests, about 75% of our third quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. And of course, if you add that on to our conventional store sales of more than $18 billion, you can see that more than 95% of our total third quarter sales were fulfilled by our stores. This store-as-hub model is the foundational element of our strategic plan we announced at the beginning of 2017, just over 3 years ago. \n Our performance for the first 3 quarters of 2020, which includes digital sales growth of nearly $6.5 billion and a store sales increase of more than $3.5 billion is the direct result of our stores-as-hub strategy combined with the tireless work of our team to bring it to life.  \n In terms of the cadence of our business throughout the quarter, we began with mid-teen comp growth in August. This reflected a slow start to the back-to-school season as many school districts across the country began their year in distance learning mode. However, sales trends in Back-to-School, Back-to-College and our overall business strengthened in September, driving comp growth in the mid-20% range for the month overall. In October, comp growth settled back to approximately 20%, consistent with our comp growth for the full quarter.  \n Across our core merchandise categories, third quarter growth was strongest in Hardlines, which saw comp growth in the mid-30% range. Within Hardlines, result was strongest in electronics, which grew more than 50%, driven by particular strength in computer software, video games, portable electronic and office equipment.  \n Within our style categories, results were strongest in home. We saw comp growth in the mid-20% range, with the strongest growth in decor and kitchen. Comp sales in apparel grew by nearly 10%, led by results in intimates and sleepwear as well as men's apparel. \n Consistent with the second quarter, both our Essentials & Beauty and Food & Beverage categories saw third quarter comp growth in the high teens. In Essentials & Beauty, we saw strength across the entire portfolio with the strongest results in paper and pet. Similarly, in Food & Beverage, we saw broad-based growth with a particular strength in adult beverages and dry grocery.  \n Following our announcement in the second quarter, this was the first full quarter in which our starting wage was $15 or higher across the country, up from $13 a year ago. The attainment of this milestone was the culmination of a commitment we first announced in the fall of 2017 when our starting wage across the country was $10. Our team has always been a key differentiator for our stores and our brand. And this $15 commitment was intended to attract, reward and retain top talent for what has long been the best team in retail.  \n Beyond our longer-term goal to raise Target's starting wage, this year, we've also focused on recognizing our team's outside efforts during these extraordinary times. Specifically, we have awarded 4 separate recognition bonuses so far in 2020. Most recently, in October, we awarded $200 to each of our frontline team members in support of our plan to invest more than $1 billion in our team for the year.  \n As we build our plans for the fourth quarter, our team focused first on flexibility and agility, knowing how volatile and unpredictable the external environment continues to be. We focused on leveraging Target's strengths, including the emotional connection between our brands and our guests and the convenience and speed of our stores-as-hub model. We're focused on listening to our guests to understand what they're experiencing, and they've told us that safety is one of their top concerns. So on top of our goal to be the easiest place to shop, we're committed to being the safest place to shop as well. \n In support of that goal, we've implemented a number of technology improvements to make shopping at Target more contact-free. These include an enhancement to our self-service lanes, which means guests no longer need to use the hand scanner to pay with their wallet function in our app. We made changes to Drive Up that eliminate the need for a team member to scan a guest phone when they deliver an order. We've rolled out a new capability on Target.com, allowing guests to check in, in advance to see whether we're currently metering traffic in their store and allow them to reserve a spot in line before leaving home. In addition, we have altered our promotional cadence to avoid events that typically cause crowd. And we announced that we'll be closed on Thanksgiving and open at the regular time on Black Friday.  \n Rather than concentrating holiday deals around Thanksgiving and Black Friday, we've spread our Black Friday offers throughout the entire month of November with weekly promotions spread across different categories throughout the month. And in the spirit of transparency and trust, we've assured our guests that they see any of our Black Friday items for a lower price later in this season, we'll happily make up the difference through our extended price match policy. \n To minimize lines, we've added more than 1,000 mobile checkout devices across the chain, allowing our team members to help guests check out anywhere in the store. We've also added thousands of gift items eligible for same-day fulfillment. And we're entering the holiday season with more than double the number of Drive Up parking spaces compared with a year ago.  \n In addition, we've added fresh, refrigerated and frozen items to our Pick Up and Drive Up assortment in more than 1,600 locations across the country, making this the first holiday season in which guests from coast-to-coast can use these convenience services to pick up everything they need for a holiday meal.  \n We're also continuing to expand the number of our merchandise categories available through our Shipt service, most recently adding kids and adult apparel. This change provides a new contactless option for guest to shop these categories and have them delivered to their front doors in as little as an hour.  \n While many things will be different this year, our guests have told us that they still plan to celebrate the holidays, and we know they'll be looking to Target for some holiday magic. \n That's why we're so excited about our recently announced partnership with FAO Schwarz. New for this holiday season, Target and FAO Schwarz have collaborated on an exclusive 70-piece toy collection with many items priced under $20. This collection will be available at Target stores nationwide, on Target.com and the flagship FAO Schwarz store in New York City.  \n Beyond this unique election, this holiday, we've created our biggest ever list of Top Toys, including more than 600 exclusive items, which will feature at an incredible value all-season long.  \n In decor, we're focused on bringing Target's brand promise to life by offering value and quality with hundreds of ornaments priced at $3, $5 and $10. \n On Target.com, more and more of our guests are shopping for decor using See It In Your Space technology, which makes our digital shopping experience more inspiring than ever. This feature allows guests to visualize what Christmas trees will look like in their homes as they prepare to decorate for the holiday. Guests who utilize this 3D rendering feature are 2x more likely to purchase a tree compared with an average digital guest.  \n In speaking with our guests, we know that finding the right gift can be a source of stress during the holiday. So this year, to make it easier than ever for our guests to share the joy, we've expanded our gifting assortment, including items for even the toughest individual on their list. With many items priced at $15 or less, we are offering incredible value, making it easier to celebrate the season with family and friends. \n And while the holiday season is top-of-mind right now, we shouldn't forget that the fourth quarter also includes a full month after the holiday. We're planning to kick off the new year on a positive note with a focus on wellness and nutrition, new exclusives in Beauty and the introduction of seamless T-shirt, fleece and performance bottoms to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of our new activewear brand, All in Motion. \n And speaking of Beauty, we couldn't be more excited about our new long-term strategic partnership with Ulta Beauty, which we announced last week. Because it embodies book style and frequency, the Beauty category is ideally suited to our strategy and it's one of our strongest growing categories over the last few years. This new partnership will help us to build on that success, providing our guests access to dozens of new beauty brands nationwide with elevated service and presentation in select store locations. \n We plan to open the first 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops later in 2021 with the potential to open 100 more in the years beyond.  \n So now before I close, I want to provide a brief update on our plans for Target's 2021 Financial Community Meeting. While no one can accurately predict the future of the coronavirus and the impact of potential vaccines, we have decided to host this meeting virtually in 2021. We made this decision out of an abundance of caution in keeping with our focus on the safety of our team and our investors. We look forward to hosting it again in person beginning in 2022.  \n So now as I get ready to turn the call over to John, I want to come back where I started and acknowledge our amazing team. When I arrived at Target a little more than 6 years ago, I already knew that Target is an academy company, a place that attracts and develops the level of talent that's the envy of other companies. That was already true before I arrived, and I couldn't be more proud of the team investments we've made in recent years, investments intended to cement Target's position as an inclusive home for top talent.  \n What I didn't appreciate until I became and immersed with this team is the warmth of the culture and the team's sincere desire for Target to play a positive role in the world. This desire often shows through in our marketing and our assortment and you could certainly see it in our stores. But for those of us who had the privilege of working with every part of this team, we see it every day behind the scenes even when no one else is looking. \n So I'll close with a simple thank you to this team for your passion to make Target a welcoming place for all families and a great place to work for everyone on the team. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John for an update on our operations and plans for the holiday season. John? \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Brian. When you pull back and consider what's happened in our business this year, it's clear that a couple of defining themes have emerged. The first is flexibility. You've seen that play out in our merchandising assortment, enabling us to satisfy our guests' rapidly changing wants and needs throughout the year. \n You've also seen it play out in our operations as our stores-as-hubs model allowed our team to pivot seamlessly when guests move their shopping between stores and our digital channels. This flexibility will continue to serve us well in the fourth quarter and beyond, given that we continue to face an elevated level of uncertainty across multiple aspects of our business.  \n Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our same-day services to deliver speed and convenience for our guests while driving an impressive amount of the company's growth. In the third quarter, our same-day services grew well over 200% compared with last year, adding more than $1 billion of incremental sales. Nearly $700 million of this growth was from our Drive Up service alone, which increased more than 500% compared with last year. Amazingly, this growth was not at the expense of in-store pickup, which increased more than 50%. And while Shipt remains the smallest of our same-day services, it continues to grow rapidly as Target sales on Shipt increased nearly 280% in the quarter, accounting for more than $200 million of incremental sales. \n I want to pause and give a shout out to our team at Shipt and congratulate them on an incredible year of growth and expansion, which has included a doubling of their shopper base.  \n Altogether, our third quarter digital sales grew more than $2 billion compared with last year. For perspective, $2 billion is more than our company's total digital sales for the entire year in 2014. Somehow, I think I should pause for a second and let that sink in. But instead, maybe I'll pile on by making the same point a different way and point out that between the first 3 quarters of 2014 and the same period this year, the compound annual growth rate of our digital sales was 45% over that 6-year period.  \n Another area in which we've seen amazing flexibility is in the management of our inventory as we've adapted to huge swings in the pace of sales among individual categories and worked to support overall growth that's been well above expectation. \n As I mentioned last quarter, while we continue to make progress, we've seen some persistent inventory shortfalls for a couple of distinct reasons. First, in several of our long lead categories, like electronics, home and apparel, our team has been playing catch-up given that we experienced an unexpected sharp and sustained explosion in demand for these categories. The team has done a great job of chasing and expediting inventory to support these categories, which enabled the unusually strong comps that Brian outlined earlier. Even more encouraging, we ended the third quarter in a much better position than where we started, and we expect to see additional recovery in the fourth quarter. \n The other driver of inventory shortfalls in 2020 is related to industry dynamics as the producers of cleaning and paper products have been working to ramp up production in the face of a dramatically higher demand across all of U.S. retail. Happily, we're also making progress in these categories. While we're not yet back to pre-COVID levels, we saw supply improve during the quarter and we expect to make continued progress in the fourth quarter. \n Overall, our progress is reflected in the aggregate numbers. Specifically, we started the third quarter with inventory down about 3% compared with the year ago and ended more than 11% higher than a year ago after a quarter in which our sales grew more than 20%. This is a remarkable progress and puts us in a much better position as we move into the fourth quarter.  \n I also want to highlight the flexibility of our properties team who just opened 18 new stores in October. For the year, our team successfully opened 30 new stores, of which 29 were small formats, making 2020 the biggest year of small format openings ever. \n In any year, setting records would be notable. But in a year in which COVID caused us to delay our new store construction, it's been amazing to watch how quickly our team was able to restart such a large number of projects and successfully bring them to completion in advance of the holiday season.  \n Beyond flexibility, another key theme this year is capacity as we consider the physical resources we'll need to support our business over time. As Brian mentioned, we've already grown our sales by more than $10 billion through the first 3 quarters of 2020. And again, for context, that $10 billion of incremental sales is more than our total sales growth between 2011 and 2019, an 8-year period. You might well have wondered whether compressing 8 years of growth into less than a year was even possible. But clearly, the capacity was there. And while capacity is a function of replenishment as well as fulfillment, the question we hear most often is whether we'll continue to have enough capacity for our digital fulfillment. And in that regard, the primary factor is our strategic decision to place our stores as the center of fulfillment. By relying on the same asset to fulfill both our conventional and digital sales, the key to fulfillment capacity is the store asset itself and the speed with which we can move inventory through it. You might refer to that as our ability to increase turnover. But sometimes you'll hear engineers like Michael and me refer to that metric as throughput just to sound smart. \n As we said in the past, sales per foot is a useful proxy for throughput. So let's consider how that has progressed so far this year. As a baseline, for the full year in 2019, average sales per foot at Target were about $320. And so far this year, that metric has grown about 19% compared with last year. So just as a thought exercise, if you assumed we were going to grow our sales productivity at that same pace for the full year, we'd end 2020 at about $380 per foot. \n Now I need to pause to quickly and reinforce. I'm using a hypothetical 19% number. I'm not providing guidance for the quarter. I'm just giving us something to anchor on. \n So the critical question is after growing sales per foot from the lower end of the $300 range into the upper 300s, do we have any more capacity in our stores? The answer is certainly yes. Last year, in our second quarter call, I mentioned that our top quartile stores averaged well over $400 a foot back in 2018 and that number has grown to nearly $500 since then. If we can average nearly $500 a foot on nearly 500 of our most productive stores, I think it's clear we have capacity to grow the chain average well beyond where it is today. And that capacity would be there even if we kept doing what we're doing today. \n But of course, we continue to find ways to improve throughput. And one of our newest options is to deploy sortation centers in markets where delivery density is high. To better assess this concept, we recently opened our first sortation center here in Minneapolis, which will allow our teams to test, learn and assess its ultimate potential before determining whether to roll out the concept further. \n The business case for our sortation center is straightforward: by moving the sorting and staging prospects out of the stores, it frees up backroom space, enabling additional throughput. Stores can simply focus on packing the orders, which are then transferred multiple times per day to the sortation center where they can be sorted and staged at a larger scale, driving per-unit efficiencies and potentially reducing the number of split shipments. In addition, we can reduce per-unit shipping cost by deploying technology from Grand Junction, which helps us to allocate packages across different providers and applying recently acquired technology from Deliv to help us to optimize sortation and injection into those provider networks. \n But unit efficiencies are only part of the potential benefit. While these centers require some capital investment, they are designed to increase both throughput and capital efficiency of our existing network, which should reduce the need for us to invest capital in upstream fulfillment centers. \n Net-net, our expectation is that investing in sortation centers will be a more capital-efficient way to add capacity, and we'll be assessing that potential through the test. \n Before I move on from this topic, I should quickly acknowledge, there are a number of other important considerations regarding capacity. Beyond overall capacity, within each store, we need to ensure we have allocated appropriate space to fulfill both our conventional store sales and our entire suite of store-fulfilled digital sales. \n There are a number of ways we account for this in our plan. First, we continue to find ways to optimize space within our stores, including options to free up front end space to accommodate growth in Pick Up and Drive Up and backroom space to accommodate peak demand for our ship-from-store capability. We're planning for this expanded capacity in our new stores and remodels, and we developed robust processes across the rest of the chain to free up space outside of a full remodel. \n Second, within each market, we route the bulk of our ship-from-store orders to lower-volume stores, allowing the highest volume stores to devote most of their capacity to conventional sales. \n And third, we've developed tools and processes to create temporary peak capacity in both the front end and the back room, which allows us to handle the fourth quarter surge in both same-day and ship-from-store volume without building a permanent solution that we wouldn't need for the rest of the year. \n We've already deployed this additional temporary capacity across the chain in advance of this year's holiday peak, which we expect will be far larger than anything we've seen in the past. \n The other consideration in planning for future capacity is our upstream supply chain, which handles the bulk of the product we receive from vendors and then routed to the stores across the country. Even going into this year, we told you that we would need to be adding to our upstream capacity to accommodate future volumes. And with this year's unprecedented growth, upstream capacity has become an even more important aspect of our plan. \n So as I've said before, I hope these metrics and our demonstrated ability to grow well beyond expectations this year can help to address any of your concerns that we're going to run out of capacity. But in the meantime, I want to cover our plans for the fourth quarter peak. The team is in place and ready, and while stores will be busy, both our promotions and operational plans are designed to minimize crowding to allow our guests to shop safely. \n Digital penetration always peaks in the fourth quarter. And this year, our store central fulfillment model is well positioned to handle an unprecedented amount of digital volume. And while all of our digital options will likely see huge volume, we're really excited about our capacity to satisfy guest demand through our same-day services. We're ending the fourth quarter with double the number of Drive Up spaces compared with a year ago. And as Brian mentioned, we've made technology changes to make it completely contactless. \n We're also entering the fourth quarter with more than 1,600 stores able to fulfill fresh, refrigerated and frozen items through our Pick Up and Drive Up services, making shopping for holiday dinners incredibly easy. Among guests who have been shopping this enhanced assortment using Drive Up, we've seen half of the orders picked up within 2 hours and 2/3 within 4 hours, demonstrating how guests are using this service to conveniently serve an urgent need. \n And finally, as we plan for seasonal hiring this year, we prioritized additional hours for our existing team members first and then added seasonal help to provide the necessary capacity. In training our teams to ensure we've accommodate peak digital fulfillment needs, we rolled out a plan to ensure that at least 50% of each store's team is cross-trained and able to support fulfillment this year. \n So like Brian, I want to close with a simple and sincere thank you to the entire team. While peak is still ahead of us, you've already made this a year to remember, and I can't wait to see what we can do together to deliver for our guests throughout this holiday season. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael who'll provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance and provide his initial thoughts as we plan for next year. Michael? \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. Similar to each of our every day lives since the onset of the coronavirus, hardly anything in our P&L has felt the same as before. But a few factors are most important in understanding our business results so far this year. \n First off, for the headwinds of which there have been several, including merchandising mix, digital fulfillment costs and an avalanche of first quarter apparel markdown. In addition, we've invested nearly $1 billion in additional pay and benefits for our team, along with safety measures to protect both our team and our guests. Yet in the face of those pressures, our business has delivered outstanding profit. And while there are various places on the P&L where you can see the favorability, they all tie back to the $10 billion of incremental sales that John mentioned earlier. \n On the expense line, this growth has resulted in an extraordinary amount of leverage, which has more than offset the pressure from additional costs. \n In addition, this year's unusually strong growth has resulted in exceptionally low markdown rates as I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes. \n When you pull back from the detail, it's clear that our business has been able to deliver both incredible top line growth and strong bottom line results. This is a hallmark of the durable model we've been building over the last few years. \n Our third quarter comparable sales increase of 20.7% reflects the continued pattern of trip consolidation by our guests as our average transaction size grew by more than 15% on top of very healthy traffic growth of 4.5%. Total sales grew 21.3%, about 60 basis points faster due to sales in new and nonmature stores. \n On the gross margin line, we recorded a rate increase of about 80 basis points in the third quarter, driven by the net impact of 3 separate factors. The first is the benefit of our merchandising efforts, which contributed well over 2 percentage points to our gross margin rate in the quarter. While there are many individual factors within this larger bucket, the most notable is on the markdown line as we saw exceptionally low promotional and clearance markdown rate. On the promotional markdown line, we've seen a year-over-year benefit since the pandemic began. And the reason is simple: when unit volume in commodity categories is so high that production is struggling to keep up with demand, it makes sense to stick with our low everyday prices and reduce the number of stock-up and other volume-driving promotions, which would only increase the number of out-of-stocks faced by our guests. \n On the clearance markdown line, we've seen even more favorability, and the reason is somewhat different. As demand for our noncommodity categories has stayed persistently higher than expected, we've sold a higher-than-average mix of our units at regular price with fewer-than-expected units sold on clearance discounts at the end of the season. Even more notable, favorability on the clearance line has been the primary driver of our overall markdown favorability on a year-to-date basis despite the exceptionally high apparel markdowns we recorded in the first quarter. \n Offsetting the benefit of our merchandising efforts, there were 2 distinct headwinds to gross margin in the third quarter. The first was from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure, driven by rapid growth, digital fulfillment, along with incremental team member pay, benefits and safety costs for our supply chain team members. The other gross margin headwind came from category sales mix, which was worth about 60 basis points of pressure as lower-margin categories grew faster than higher-margin categories during the quarter. \n On the SG&A expense line, we recorded about 180 basis points of favorability in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the favorability on this line reflects exceptionally strong cost leverage due to sales growth of more than 20%. This benefit was so strong, it was able to offset about $300 million of incremental investments in team member pay and benefit, along with safety measures to protect our team and our guests. \n On the D&A line, dollars were down about 6% from a year ago worth about 70 basis points of rate improvement as we continued to annualize higher levels of accelerated depreciation on last year's larger remodel program. \n Altogether, the business delivered an exceptionally high operating margin rate of 8.5%, more than 3 percentage points higher than last year. On a dollar basis, operating income grew more than $900 million or more than 90% compared with last year. \n On the interest expense line, we recognized a $512 million loss on debt extinguishment related to a debt tender offer we executed in October. \n In light of our higher profitability, income taxes grew by about $90 million compared with last year. \n On the bottom line, despite the loss on debt extinguishment, which was equivalent to $0.75 of pressure, third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations established a new record high of $2.01, representing an increase of 46% compared with $1.37 last year. Adjusted EPS, which excluded the debt extinguishment loss and a couple of other small factors in both years, also established a new record high of $2.79, more than 100% higher than $1.36 last year. \n Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. Specifically, through the first 3 quarters of the year, our operations have delivered just over $7 billion of cash, which is nearly $3 billion more than a year ago. Obviously, our profit performance is an important factor in this increase, but we also continued to benefit from unusually high payables leverage, which is running well over 100%. Consistent with my comments last quarter and despite the inventory growth John mentioned earlier, we would have chosen to have less cash at the end of the quarter and more inventory if that option had been available. \n In light of the continued strength of our cash generation and resulting cash position on our balance sheet, our treasury team recently elected to take a couple of actions. The first was the execution of a debt tender offer in October, in which we invested $2.3 billion of cash to retire $1.8 billion of high coupon long-term debt. This transaction created significant economic value and it will significantly reduce future interest costs. In addition, it allowed us to deploy the bulk of the extra cash we added in the first quarter when, like many other well-capitalized companies, we chose to take on additional liquidity insurance at a time of extreme uncertainty following the onset of the pandemic. \n The other decision was made earlier this month when we terminated a supplementary 364-day credit facility, which was also added during the period of extremely high uncertainty during the first quarter. \n Beyond those actions, we also announced today that we have lifted the share repurchase suspension that we initially announced in the first quarter. We don't intend to engage in any repurchases before the end of the holiday season, but under appropriate conditions, we would look to reinitiate repurchases in 2021. As a reminder, we currently have $4.5 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September of 2019. \n As always, the timing and quantity of repurchase activity will be governed by our decades-long capital deployment goals: we first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria; second, we support our dividend and look to build on our nearly 50-year record of annual increases in our dividend per share; and finally, we deploy any excess cash beyond the first 2 uses to repurchase our shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. These capital priorities have served us well for decades and have played a critical role in supporting both strong operations and a strong balance sheet over time. \n In terms of capital deployment, we made capital investments of about $600 million in the third quarter, bringing our total for the year to just over $2 billion. \n We continue to expect full year CapEx in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, below our original expectation of about $3.5 billion, driven primarily by the reduction in remodel activity following the onset of COVID-19. \n We paid dividends of $340 million in the third quarter, reflecting a 3% increase in the dividend per share, partially offset by a decline in share count. And of course, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter in light of the suspension I mentioned earlier. \n Turning now to our after-tax return on invested capital. Our business delivered an extraordinarily high 19.9% in the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, up nearly 5 percentage points from 15% a year ago. While our longer-term plans have focused on delivering higher after-tax ROIC over time, the acceleration over the last 2 quarters has been well beyond anything we would have expected. And given that our inventories have been consistently lower than we'd prefer, we gladly would have traded some cash for more inventory over the last 2 quarters even though that would have driven this metric somewhat lower. \n So now before I close, I want to comment a little bit about our outlook. While we stopped driving financial guidance back in the first quarter, I want to outline a number of important considerations as we move into the holiday season and the fourth quarter overall. The first is the continued headwinds facing the consumer and the economy. In light of uncertainty around the path of the pandemic and continued elevated levels of unemployment. \n Offsetting this pressure, beginning with the onset of the pandemic, there has been a significant change in the mix of consumer spending as a meaningful portion has shifted away from travel and multiple forms of out-of-home entertainment and into many of the categories we sell. \n We also continue to benefit from trip consolidation as consumers have increasingly relied on our stores and digital services to satisfy a wide variety of their wants and needs in a single trip. \n Beyond these macro trends, there are a number of more specific considerations as we enter the holiday. The first is the expected change in the category mix of our fourth quarter business as typically both our electronics and toy categories generate half their annual sales in the fourth quarter. Given that both of these categories have seen dramatically stronger sales since the pandemic began, it's more difficult than usual to predict how the pattern will play out in the fourth quarter. \n Similarly, the digital mix of our sales, an important factor in our overall profitability, typically reaches a seasonal peak in the fourth quarter. This year, it's difficult to predict how high our digital mix will become given that we've already seen dramatically higher levels of digital penetration all year. \n So the natural question is, once you quantify all the potential headwinds and tailwinds you've just outlined, what's your fourth quarter forecast? Well, I think that's a great question. The reality is that none of us can accurately predict the future as all of us are facing a much higher level of uncertainty compared with a normal year. That's the reason why we've suspended financial guidance, but that doesn't mean we can't affect the outcome. As I've mentioned before, we continue to prioritize flexibility as we plan our business and focus on agility in our operations. That way, when the unexpected happens, our team can respond quickly and effectively as you've seen so far this year. \n Looking ahead to next year, the crystal ball doesn't get any clearer. Not only is it uncertain when the coronavirus will be fully behind us, it's also unclear how the consumer will behave in a post-COVID world. That creates uncertainty about the path of multiple categories as you consider how the mix of consumer spending will evolve and what the competitive landscape will look like. In adapting to that new world, we'll need to understand what that will mean for our business and how the financial metrics that have been dramatically changed this year will settle down over time. And today, while we can't answer these questions any more accurately than you can, it's clear that flexibility and agility will continue to be vitally important. \n So while specific metrics will continue to be difficult to predict, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our business and our ability to outperform. That's because based on the hard work of our team over the last few years, we now have a business model that's demonstrated its ability to deliver market share growth and profitability across a range of environments that's been far wider than any of us would have expected. And importantly, in a time where virtually nothing has stayed consistent, the one reliable through line across weeks and product categories has been consistent share gains throughout the year. \n In addition, we've seen a massive increase in guest engagement this year as they ventured into new categories and service at Target. And as I mentioned in our first quarter call, we've long known that engagement with guests at a time when their habits are changing is an incredibly important factor in deepening long-term loyalty. It's the reason we prioritize the Back-to-College season when many consumers are moving away from home for the first time. It's also the reason we're there for young couples when they get married and when they have children because our relationship with young families has long been a foundational aspect of our strategy. \n But most importantly, our team is a huge reason why we're confident in our future. We've long told you that we have the best team in retail, and this year's experience has demonstrated why we feel that way. Throughout the year, our team has stayed optimistic, they've taken care of each other, they've offered friendly service to our guests and they've successfully overcome a host of unforeseen challenges. The longer I've been at Target, the more I've seen how our team is Target's secret sauce, and I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of them for everything they've accomplished so far this year. \n With that, I'll turn it back over to Brian for some final thoughts. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thank you. I want to reinforce Michael's commentary on our connection to families, which is so fundamental to our strategy. It's right at the center of our corporate purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. As we enter the holiday season at the end of a truly remarkable year, we're humbled and gratified at the number of families who have turned to Target to help them stay connected this year. We've helped them to find everything they need for a birthday party, including the decor, the food, the presents and a card. We created registries for couples getting married and for parents excited to celebrate the birth of a new child. We've helped our guests to stay connected from a distance with a new mobile phone or tablet. And we've helped them enjoy the additional time they're spending at home, whether that was new decor, office equipment, toys, video games or even activewear now that it's become work appropriate in a world in which all meetings are virtual. \n Even though the holidays will be different this year, we know our guests still want to discover the joy and connect with those closest to them. So our team is focused on helping to make that happen while providing helpful and friendly service in a safe environment during the busiest time of the year. \n So with that, we'll move to Q&A. John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So I have a near-term question and a long-term question, starting with the near term. I guess curious what your thoughts are on how this holiday plays out. What's the mood of the consumers that you've seen as you head into holiday? You've had some events already that could probably test where you're seeing strength and where you're not seeing strength. So how are you thinking about -- what's the outlook here for the holiday and the timing and so forth? \nBrian Cornell: Well, Chris, it's Brian. Why don't I start out, give everyone a sense for how we're viewing the holiday season. And we've spent a lot of time talking to guests throughout the year. And as it pertains to the holiday, they're clearly telling us that they want to celebrate this holiday season, but they know it's going to be very different: smaller gatherings, those trips that we used to take will be postponed. But we certainly expect that the guests that we serve is going to look for ways to find that little bit of joy during the holiday season. \n They've reacted very positively to our new promotional plan to start early and actually make those deals available throughout the holiday season. We've heard very positive responses to closing on Thanksgiving and really minimizing those big traffic-driving occasions that we've seen in the past. \n So we expect this to be a season that's going to be very different, unlike any other we've ever seen. But we expect that guests will decorate their home, and there'll be gifts under the tree and they'll find special ways to celebrate the holiday season. And they'll turn to  Target and our multi-category portfolio and our suite of fulfillment services as a way to make that happen. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then on the long term, so you've seen the likes of Levi's, Disney shop-in-shops, Ulta last week. Today, WWD has an article that Journelle is coming to Target. It's clear the level of fashion is on the rise at Target. There are plenty of well-known brands that sell into likes of Penneys and Kohl's and Macy's that now seem like a natural fit from Under Armour, Chaps, CK. Is this an active strategy that you are pursuing on the apparel side? What's been the dialogue there? And is there any pushback that you've heard from these types of brands? \nBrian Cornell: First, to be really clear, our focus will always be on curation and making sure we balance the right mix of our own brand and select national brand partners. And that will be an approach we'll take for years to come. So we're very excited about some of our new partnerships and working now with Levi's. And next year, in 2021, welcoming Ulta Beauty to our stores and to Target.com. But we'll always be curators and finding the right mix for our guests between our own brands and iconic national brands. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink from Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: I have a follow-up question to Chris' question just on brand expansion, but I'm curious if we can look through the lens of your guest profile. Any insights into new to file guests, where they might be coming from and how those baskets may look relative to your historic average guest? \nBrian Cornell: Stephanie, we've talked about the number of new guests that have turned to Target during the pandemic. As John and Michael and I referred to in our opening comments, we're seeing a guest shop multiple categories, take advantage of our vast multi-category portfolio. Some days, they're shopping our stores. Some days, they're taking advantage of our same-day fulfillment services. And we expect that to continue. So the guests that are shopping our stores right now are taking advantage of the multiple categories that we sell. They are shopping in apparel and home. They're coming into Hardlines and Food & Beverage. They're taking advantage of our Beauty offerings as well as Household Essentials. And again, some days, we see them taking advantage of the investments we've made to create a safe shopping experience in-store. And other days, they're taking advantage of the ease and convenience of our same-day fulfillment services. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Your gross margin performance this quarter was excellent obviously. But can you provide a bit more color just on the markdown situation? So of the 200 basis points that you mentioned, was that all markdowns? How much of that was just less promos versus clearance? \n And then how do we think about Q4 as it relates to these line items? It's obviously pretty hard for us to predict at this point. I'm sure for you as well. But any color there, I think, would be helpful. \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. I can take that one. When you think about the drivers in Q3, the north of 200 basis points of good news from a bucket of levers within merchandising. The single biggest of those, for certain, was markdown efficiency. And we've seen continued efficiency on the promo markdown line throughout the year. \n And then clearance, and so much of that is a function of our sales -- our higher-than-expected sales in some of the seasonal categories. As you guys well know, a big part of our recipe for assortment in stores is bringing seasonal relevance and newness. In Q3, we changed over a lot of the store heading into the fall. And we had sold through a greater degree of that assortment this year than we typically see, and that provided some real tailwind on the margin line in Q3. \n When it comes to Q4, as one said, Q4 is always its own animal. So we build Q4 bottom-up with a clean sheet of paper and that's the way we've done it this year with admittedly a few more uncertainties in that equation than we might have typically. But we feel really good about, importantly, how our inventory is positioned heading into the holiday season. And we expect and feel good about our prospects for the quarter looking forward and the strength of the multi-category assortment and the strength of our fulfillment options and the ease and convenience that we'll be able to bring the guests should bode well for the fourth quarter as well. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. It's Brian. I'd only add and really recognize the great work our merchants teams have done throughout the pandemic and certainly in the third quarter, making sure that we quickly adjust assortment to make sure it's relevant for the guests in today's environment. And I think you'll expect to see that in the fourth quarter as well. \n But our merchants have worked very closely with our key vendor partners to make sure we're making the adjustments and we've got the relevant items in our stores and online that guests are looking for today. And that's certainly been a big part of our success throughout 2020. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nEdward Yruma: You guys have been very successful in operating and opening stores in some of these more densely populated urban areas. Wonder if you could give us some sense to how they performed, maybe as some folks have left these cities. \n And I guess the flip side it, if real estate becomes more accessible, is this a strategy you could continue to lean into longer term? \nBrian Cornell: John, you want to talk about small formats in 2020 and some of the outlook that we have for 2021? \nJohn Mulligan: Sure. Yes, we remain really bullish on the small-format stores and the opportunity in front of us there. We have many different types of trade areas that we have opened small formats in over the years, and by and large, they are all performing well. \n There's a couple that I would say are probably not quite where we'd like to be given the year. One is college campuses. Those stores that are heavily dependent on just students have lagged the company a little bit. And the other one is really on employment centers, not really around dense urban neighborhoods. Dense urban neighborhoods have continued to perform very, very well. Employment centers where people have been working from home, those have also lagged a little bit the rest of the chain. \n But as we look forward, we continue to see great opportunities across all the different trade areas. We believe college campuses, we're very bullish on those for the future. And so you'll continue to see us look to open small formats in many of the same areas that we've opened them in historically. And you'll see us begin to accelerate a little bit next year, potentially 30 to 35, perhaps over time get to 40 stores a year as we continue to think about opening those smaller stores to address trade areas where guests are seeking the Target experience, but today can't get that store experience. So like I said, we remain very bullish on that whole concept. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. \nKaren Short: I'm just wondering, with respect -- a short-term question and then longer term. You gave a lot of color in terms of the things that you're doing near term and also for January to the extent that January slows down. But I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about December from the perspective of there's been so much pull-forward of shopping. Do you think there's some risk from a December perspective that December kind of fizzles a little bit? And how are you planning for that? \n And then I just had one other bigger picture. \nBrian Cornell: Karen, why don't I start? I think as we've looked at the holiday season, we expected the guests to start shopping earlier but continue to shop throughout the holiday season right up to Christmas eve. So we think it's going to be a prolonged shopping season. I think we're going to see very different shopping patterns. We don't expect to see those big spikes during Black Friday and on weekends. I think it's going to be spread across the holiday season. \n And we think December is going to be a very important gifting season for our guests. So we're watching it carefully. And again, we'll put a premium on flexibility and agility as we work through the months of November and December. But all indications, as we've talked to the consumer and talked to the guests is they're going to look to celebrate this holiday season. They're going to be focused on gifting and celebrating with their family and close friends. And we expect them to be in our stores and shopping online right till the very end of the holiday season. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then my second question is just for -- as we look to 2021, obviously, there are some tough comparisons on the top line and maybe some tougher comparisons on the promotional from a lack of promotions this year. How are you thinking about the environment in 2021 as some retailers have to lap some of the tough comparisons? Or is it a function of the fact that there are many retailers that really can't be promotional because they don't have the balance sheet and capability to do that? \nBrian Cornell: Karen, right now, we're very focused on the first half of 2021. And this is going to be a familiar theme: really taking some of the lessons learned from 2020, putting a premium on flexibility and agility because as Michael and I have both said, we, unfortunately, don't have that crystal ball as we look to the future. We're all looking for greater certainty. But we know we're going to go into the first half of 2021 facing the continued pandemic, waiting for vaccines, looking for greater clarity around the condition of the economy and unemployment. And I think we're going to just have to make sure that we remain flexible and provide the assortment and the services and the safety that the guest is looking for from Target. \n We certainly expect certain trends will continue. We think guests will continue to consolidate the number of locations where they shop. We think our multi-category portfolio will continue to be very important as we serve the needs of families. We think ease and convenience, combined with safety, will continue to be important. And we'll continue to deliver great value. \n So Michael talked about our continued focus on market share and the market share opportunities that are in front of us, and I think we'll be very focused on continuing to build off of the market share gains that we achieved in 2020 and further share opportunities in 2021. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: A couple of quick ones. Just I'm curious if you can quantify the percent of your sales increase that's being driven by new customers versus existing customers? Curious about the store comp, if you can talk traffic versus ticket. \n And then, Brian, you mentioned, I think the top quartile of your stores are doing $500 a foot. Curious if you looked at that top quartile, let's say, as of 2019 versus the bottom quartile, how are each of those performing this year in 2020? \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Why don't I start and then I'll ask for both John and Michael to provide a perspective. \n But I'll start with the recognition that on an average week, we see well over 30 million guests shopping our stores. And as you've seen in our third quarter results, we've seen traffic continue to grow at a rate of 4.5%, basket expand over 15%, and certainly, there are a mix of new guests to Target. \n But the Target guests and the families that shop us each and every week are visiting us more frequently. They're certainly shopping more categories. And that's creating greater trips either to our stores or to our fulfillment channels, and they're shopping a wider array of categories to take advantage of our multi-category portfolio.  So we're seeing both growth with our existing guests and new guests to Target and to Target.com. \n Mike, can you give perspective on top-tier versus lower-tier store performance? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I'll take that really quickly. As you'd imagine, given just the magnitude of the number of stores, those tiers tend to move in unison. So we talked about the top tier being up, the bottom tier move the same amount. And any individual store will have its own story. But in quartile, they tend to move pretty consistently. \nBrian Cornell: So I think the only thing I'd add is we look at our performance, our comps by geography each and every week. And we're seeing very consistent results literally across the country. From both coasts and the heartland of America and in the Southern market, really consistent comp and growth performance. So certainly, it's not 1 or 2 markets that are driving it. It's not our top-tier stores versus some of our lower-volume stores. We're seeing a consistent lift across the entire fleet of stores and obviously very strong growth in our digital channels. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Very strong quarter. The question I'm not going to ask is to John on whether there's enough capacity for the holiday season. I think the point is very well made there. \n But I do want to ask about -- I do want to ask about the evolution of the same-day services. And just curious on what you're learning given the robust growth, how you're improving efficiency, your ability to add additional items of merchandise in categories to be included in those services? \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Well, first, thank you, God bless you for not asking about capacity. I would tell you, our store teams and the Shipt team continue to execute our same-day services at a very, very high level. And I think you hit on one of the things we've been very focused on this year, which is really assortment expansion. For Drive Up and for Pick Up, that has meant adding frozen, refrigerated and fresh foods. We are on a trajectory when we started the year to add it to about 300 stores. We obviously paused in the early spring. And then as things started to open up, really proud of the way our store teams responded and decided we could execute that across our properties team, supply chain and stores to get that in close to 1,600 of our stores today. And so that's available and that's been a huge win for our guests. \n We see the unit increases -- the number of units in the basket increase as guests start shopping that. It was the #1 guest satisfier. If I can come and get diapers and a couple of other things, why can't I get a gallon of milk and some eggs. And so now we're able to fulfill that. \n Right along with that, in OPU and Drive Up -- with Order Pick Up and Drive Up, we've added adult beverage, another key category for us where, again, it just tops off the basket. So a real guest satisfier and we'll continue to work to add other categories at Shipt. The opportunity there was to get some more of our discretionary categories available for our guests as they use our same-day service. And so as Brian mentioned earlier in the call, we added children's and adult apparel to that right here before the holiday. We think that will do very well. \n So the teams continue to execute, continue to build efficiencies into what we're doing. But importantly -- I think the most important thing is they continue to ask the guests what it is they want and what we can fulfill for them and you'll see us continue to work toward that. And that will guide really how we continue to improve those services. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: First, Brian and team, I just want to say congrats on the execution of your strategy. It's been plain remarkable. \n My question, I'm sorry, I'm going to ask two. Brian, you mentioned Shipt. I was wondering if you could give us a little more on Shipt and profitability and maybe growth outside of Target, maybe a little more color on what Shipt is becoming. \n And then the second, maybe a shorter question, just a Target Plus, your marketplace. Anything changing with your strategy there that you can share with us, given your momentum online? \nBrian Cornell: John, you want to start with Shipt and then we'll wrap up with Target Plus. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. We continue to be really, really pleased with the performance of Shipt and the execution of the team. As we said, Shipt at Target has grown 280% this quarter, $200 million of incremental sales. So -- and it's a key part of what we're going to do here in the fourth quarter, we think you'll see us throughout the fourth quarter really lean into our same-day service as Order Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt as a way -- as our way to fulfill our guest needs, and Shipt will be a big part of that. \n I think beyond that, Shipt continues to experience very strong growth. They continue to add retailers. There are over 100 national and regional retailers. They added Bed Bath & Beyond this quarter in addition to a few others. They've doubled the number of shoppers since the spring and are planning to add another 100,000 shoppers here for the fourth quarter. So we continue to see really strong growth, and we're very pleased with Shipt's performance overall. \nBrian Cornell: And Robby, on Target Plus, our approach continues to be the same. We're very selectively curating some vendor partners. I think we're up to about 175 right now. We probably have now close to 400,000 SKUs available through Target Plus. But we'll continue to make sure we curate very carefully and complement our store and online assortment. \n So with that, I do want to thank everyone for joining us today. I wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. We look forward to the day when we can all be back together in person. \n But thanks for joining us. Thanks for your support, and have a safe and happy holiday season.",

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. When you pull back and consider what's happened in our business this year, it's clear that a couple of defining themes have emerged. The first is flexibility. You've seen that play out in our merchandising assortment, enabling us to satisfy our guests' rapidly changing wants and needs throughout the year. \n You've also seen it play out in our operations as our stores-as-hubs model allowed our team to pivot seamlessly when guests move their shopping between stores and our digital channels. This flexibility will continue to serve us well in the fourth quarter and beyond, given that we continue to face an elevated level of uncertainty across multiple aspects of our business.  \n Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our same-day services to deliver speed and convenience for our guests while driving an impressive amount of the company's growth. In the third quarter, our same-day services grew well over 200% compared with last year, adding more than $1 billion of incremental sales. Nearly $700 million of this growth was from our Drive Up service alone, which increased more than 500% compared with last year. Amazingly, this growth was not at the expense of in-store pickup, which increased more than 50%. And while Shipt remains the smallest of our same-day services, it continues to grow rapidly as Target sales on Shipt increased nearly 280% in the quarter, accounting for more than $200 million of incremental sales. \n I want to pause and give a shout out to our team at Shipt and congratulate them on an incredible year of growth and expansion, which has included a doubling of their shopper base.  \n Altogether, our third quarter digital sales grew more than $2 billion compared with last year. For perspective, $2 billion is more than our company's total digital sales for the entire year in 2014. Somehow, I think I should pause for a second and let that sink in. But instead, maybe I'll pile on by making the same point a different way and point out that between the first 3 quarters of 2014 and the same period this year, the compound annual growth rate of our digital sales was 45% over that 6-year period.  \n Another area in which we've seen amazing flexibility is in the management of our inventory as we've adapted to huge swings in the pace of sales among individual categories and worked to support overall growth that's been well above expectation. \n As I mentioned last quarter, while we continue to make progress, we've seen some persistent inventory shortfalls for a couple of distinct reasons. First, in several of our long lead categories, like electronics, home and apparel, our team has been playing catch-up given that we experienced an unexpected sharp and sustained explosion in demand for these categories. The team has done a great job of chasing and expediting inventory to support these categories, which enabled the unusually strong comps that Brian outlined earlier. Even more encouraging, we ended the third quarter in a much better position than where we started, and we expect to see additional recovery in the fourth quarter. \n The other driver of inventory shortfalls in 2020 is related to industry dynamics as the producers of cleaning and paper products have been working to ramp up production in the face of a dramatically higher demand across all of U.S. retail. Happily, we're also making progress in these categories. While we're not yet back to pre-COVID levels, we saw supply improve during the quarter and we expect to make continued progress in the fourth quarter. \n Overall, our progress is reflected in the aggregate numbers. Specifically, we started the third quarter with inventory down about 3% compared with the year ago and ended more than 11% higher than a year ago after a quarter in which our sales grew more than 20%. This is a remarkable progress and puts us in a much better position as we move into the fourth quarter.  \n I also want to highlight the flexibility of our properties team who just opened 18 new stores in October. For the year, our team successfully opened 30 new stores, of which 29 were small formats, making 2020 the biggest year of small format openings ever. \n In any year, setting records would be notable. But in a year in which COVID caused us to delay our new store construction, it's been amazing to watch how quickly our team was able to restart such a large number of projects and successfully bring them to completion in advance of the holiday season.  \n Beyond flexibility, another key theme this year is capacity as we consider the physical resources we'll need to support our business over time. As Brian mentioned, we've already grown our sales by more than $10 billion through the first 3 quarters of 2020. And again, for context, that $10 billion of incremental sales is more than our total sales growth between 2011 and 2019, an 8-year period. You might well have wondered whether compressing 8 years of growth into less than a year was even possible. But clearly, the capacity was there. And while capacity is a function of replenishment as well as fulfillment, the question we hear most often is whether we'll continue to have enough capacity for our digital fulfillment. And in that regard, the primary factor is our strategic decision to place our stores as the center of fulfillment. By relying on the same asset to fulfill both our conventional and digital sales, the key to fulfillment capacity is the store asset itself and the speed with which we can move inventory through it. You might refer to that as our ability to increase turnover. But sometimes you'll hear engineers like Michael and me refer to that metric as throughput just to sound smart. \n As we said in the past, sales per foot is a useful proxy for throughput. So let's consider how that has progressed so far this year. As a baseline, for the full year in 2019, average sales per foot at Target were about $320. And so far this year, that metric has grown about 19% compared with last year. So just as a thought exercise, if you assumed we were going to grow our sales productivity at that same pace for the full year, we'd end 2020 at about $380 per foot. \n Now I need to pause to quickly and reinforce. I'm using a hypothetical 19% number. I'm not providing guidance for the quarter. I'm just giving us something to anchor on. \n So the critical question is after growing sales per foot from the lower end of the $300 range into the upper 300s, do we have any more capacity in our stores? The answer is certainly yes. Last year, in our second quarter call, I mentioned that our top quartile stores averaged well over $400 a foot back in 2018 and that number has grown to nearly $500 since then. If we can average nearly $500 a foot on nearly 500 of our most productive stores, I think it's clear we have capacity to grow the chain average well beyond where it is today. And that capacity would be there even if we kept doing what we're doing today. \n But of course, we continue to find ways to improve throughput. And one of our newest options is to deploy sortation centers in markets where delivery density is high. To better assess this concept, we recently opened our first sortation center here in Minneapolis, which will allow our teams to test, learn and assess its ultimate potential before determining whether to roll out the concept further. \n The business case for our sortation center is straightforward: by moving the sorting and staging prospects out of the stores, it frees up backroom space, enabling additional throughput. Stores can simply focus on packing the orders, which are then transferred multiple times per day to the sortation center where they can be sorted and staged at a larger scale, driving per-unit efficiencies and potentially reducing the number of split shipments. In addition, we can reduce per-unit shipping cost by deploying technology from Grand Junction, which helps us to allocate packages across different providers and applying recently acquired technology from Deliv to help us to optimize sortation and injection into those provider networks. \n But unit efficiencies are only part of the potential benefit. While these centers require some capital investment, they are designed to increase both throughput and capital efficiency of our existing network, which should reduce the need for us to invest capital in upstream fulfillment centers. \n Net-net, our expectation is that investing in sortation centers will be a more capital-efficient way to add capacity, and we'll be assessing that potential through the test. \n Before I move on from this topic, I should quickly acknowledge, there are a number of other important considerations regarding capacity. Beyond overall capacity, within each store, we need to ensure we have allocated appropriate space to fulfill both our conventional store sales and our entire suite of store-fulfilled digital sales. \n There are a number of ways we account for this in our plan. First, we continue to find ways to optimize space within our stores, including options to free up front end space to accommodate growth in Pick Up and Drive Up and backroom space to accommodate peak demand for our ship-from-store capability. We're planning for this expanded capacity in our new stores and remodels, and we developed robust processes across the rest of the chain to free up space outside of a full remodel. \n Second, within each market, we route the bulk of our ship-from-store orders to lower-volume stores, allowing the highest volume stores to devote most of their capacity to conventional sales. \n And third, we've developed tools and processes to create temporary peak capacity in both the front end and the back room, which allows us to handle the fourth quarter surge in both same-day and ship-from-store volume without building a permanent solution that we wouldn't need for the rest of the year. \n We've already deployed this additional temporary capacity across the chain in advance of this year's holiday peak, which we expect will be far larger than anything we've seen in the past. \n The other consideration in planning for future capacity is our upstream supply chain, which handles the bulk of the product we receive from vendors and then routed to the stores across the country. Even going into this year, we told you that we would need to be adding to our upstream capacity to accommodate future volumes. And with this year's unprecedented growth, upstream capacity has become an even more important aspect of our plan. \n So as I've said before, I hope these metrics and our demonstrated ability to grow well beyond expectations this year can help to address any of your concerns that we're going to run out of capacity. But in the meantime, I want to cover our plans for the fourth quarter peak. The team is in place and ready, and while stores will be busy, both our promotions and operational plans are designed to minimize crowding to allow our guests to shop safely. \n Digital penetration always peaks in the fourth quarter. And this year, our store central fulfillment model is well positioned to handle an unprecedented amount of digital volume. And while all of our digital options will likely see huge volume, we're really excited about our capacity to satisfy guest demand through our same-day services. We're ending the fourth quarter with double the number of Drive Up spaces compared with a year ago. And as Brian mentioned, we've made technology changes to make it completely contactless. \n We're also entering the fourth quarter with more than 1,600 stores able to fulfill fresh, refrigerated and frozen items through our Pick Up and Drive Up services, making shopping for holiday dinners incredibly easy. Among guests who have been shopping this enhanced assortment using Drive Up, we've seen half of the orders picked up within 2 hours and 2/3 within 4 hours, demonstrating how guests are using this service to conveniently serve an urgent need. \n And finally, as we plan for seasonal hiring this year, we prioritized additional hours for our existing team members first and then added seasonal help to provide the necessary capacity. In training our teams to ensure we've accommodate peak digital fulfillment needs, we rolled out a plan to ensure that at least 50% of each store's team is cross-trained and able to support fulfillment this year. \n So like Brian, I want to close with a simple and sincere thank you to the entire team. While peak is still ahead of us, you've already made this a year to remember, and I can't wait to see what we can do together to deliver for our guests throughout this holiday season. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael who'll provide more detail on our third quarter financial performance and provide his initial thoughts as we plan for next year. Michael? Sure. Yes, we remain really bullish on the small-format stores and the opportunity in front of us there. We have many different types of trade areas that we have opened small formats in over the years, and by and large, they are all performing well. \n There's a couple that I would say are probably not quite where we'd like to be given the year. One is college campuses. Those stores that are heavily dependent on just students have lagged the company a little bit. And the other one is really on employment centers, not really around dense urban neighborhoods. Dense urban neighborhoods have continued to perform very, very well. Employment centers where people have been working from home, those have also lagged a little bit the rest of the chain. \n But as we look forward, we continue to see great opportunities across all the different trade areas. We believe college campuses, we're very bullish on those for the future. And so you'll continue to see us look to open small formats in many of the same areas that we've opened them in historically. And you'll see us begin to accelerate a little bit next year, potentially 30 to 35, perhaps over time get to 40 stores a year as we continue to think about opening those smaller stores to address trade areas where guests are seeking the Target experience, but today can't get that store experience. So like I said, we remain very bullish on that whole concept. Yes. Well, first, thank you, God bless you for not asking about capacity. I would tell you, our store teams and the Shipt team continue to execute our same-day services at a very, very high level. And I think you hit on one of the things we've been very focused on this year, which is really assortment expansion. For Drive Up and for Pick Up, that has meant adding frozen, refrigerated and fresh foods. We are on a trajectory when we started the year to add it to about 300 stores.

It was the #1 guest satisfier. If I can come and get diapers and a couple of other things, why can't I get a gallon of milk and some eggs. And so now we're able to fulfill that. \n Right along with that, in OPU and Drive Up -- with Order Pick Up and Drive Up, we've added adult beverage, another key category for us where, again, it just tops off the basket.

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I move to our third quarter results, I want to acknowledge our team. In an incredibly challenging environment, they have stayed focused on our guests, looked out for each other and built on the purpose and a clear set of priorities we've had in place for several years, making Target an even more relevant and responsive company for the millions of families we serve every week.  \n The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us, and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. They've stayed laser-focused on safety, agility and reliability as they seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and shopping patterns. They've handled supply constraints in essential categories while chasing inventory in long lead time categories that are experiencing explosive growth. They've been a calming presence and a friendly face to our guests, who are craving normalcy at a time when hardly anything feels that way.  \n And our team members have passionately played an active, positive role in our communities during an incredibly turbulent year. With a deepening level of trust our guests are placing in our team and our brand, we've continued to see very strong business results. \n Third quarter sales grew nearly $4 billion over last year, bringing our year-to-date growth to more than $10 billion. This unprecedented growth, both in the quarter and the year, has been driven by meaningful share gains across every one of our core categories as guests increasingly rely on Target to reliably and safely serve their wants and needs.  \n Based on the cost leverage driven by steeply higher sales, our business continued to deliver impressive bottom line performance despite the outside investments we have been making in our team, safety and digital fulfillment. \n Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.79 established another record high for company and was up more than 100% from last year. \n Third quarter comparable sales increased 20.7%, reflecting a 4.5% traffic growth, combined with an increase in average ticket of more than 15%.  \n Since the pandemic began in March, we've experienced a meaningful acceleration in basket growth, both in stores and online, as guests have consolidated their shopping into much larger trips. Across channels, our store comps grew nearly 10% while our digital comp sales grew 155%, contributing nearly 11 percentage points to the company comp.  \n Within digital, we continued to see the strongest growth in our same-day services, Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt, which, together, grew more than 200% in the quarter. These services are fast, convenient, reliable and contactless, which explains why they continue to generate very high levels of guest satisfaction. All our financial reporting counts these same-day orders as digital. These services are entirely enabled by our stores. Specifically, same-day orders are fulfilled by our store teams, along with Shipt shoppers, who rely on store inventory and systems to deliver to the front of our stores, our parking lots or guest front doors within a couple of hours receiving an order.  \n Beyond same-day services, well over half of our packages we ship to guest homes are also fulfilled from our stores, providing speed to our guests while reducing shipping costs on our P&L. \n Altogether, between same-day services and packages shipped to our guests, about 75% of our third quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. And of course, if you add that on to our conventional store sales of more than $18 billion, you can see that more than 95% of our total third quarter sales were fulfilled by our stores. This store-as-hub model is the foundational element of our strategic plan we announced at the beginning of 2017, just over 3 years ago. \n Our performance for the first 3 quarters of 2020, which includes digital sales growth of nearly $6.5 billion and a store sales increase of more than $3.5 billion is the direct result of our stores-as-hub strategy combined with the tireless work of our team to bring it to life.  \n In terms of the cadence of our business throughout the quarter, we began with mid-teen comp growth in August. This reflected a slow start to the back-to-school season as many school districts across the country began their year in distance learning mode. However, sales trends in Back-to-School, Back-to-College and our overall business strengthened in September, driving comp growth in the mid-20% range for the month overall. In October, comp growth settled back to approximately 20%, consistent with our comp growth for the full quarter.  \n Across our core merchandise categories, third quarter growth was strongest in Hardlines, which saw comp growth in the mid-30% range. Within Hardlines, result was strongest in electronics, which grew more than 50%, driven by particular strength in computer software, video games, portable electronic and office equipment.  \n Within our style categories, results were strongest in home. We saw comp growth in the mid-20% range, with the strongest growth in decor and kitchen. Comp sales in apparel grew by nearly 10%, led by results in intimates and sleepwear as well as men's apparel. \n Consistent with the second quarter, both our Essentials & Beauty and Food & Beverage categories saw third quarter comp growth in the high teens. In Essentials & Beauty, we saw strength across the entire portfolio with the strongest results in paper and pet. Similarly, in Food & Beverage, we saw broad-based growth with a particular strength in adult beverages and dry grocery.  \n Following our announcement in the second quarter, this was the first full quarter in which our starting wage was $15 or higher across the country, up from $13 a year ago. The attainment of this milestone was the culmination of a commitment we first announced in the fall of 2017 when our starting wage across the country was $10. Our team has always been a key differentiator for our stores and our brand. And this $15 commitment was intended to attract, reward and retain top talent for what has long been the best team in retail.  \n Beyond our longer-term goal to raise Target's starting wage, this year, we've also focused on recognizing our team's outside efforts during these extraordinary times. Specifically, we have awarded 4 separate recognition bonuses so far in 2020. Most recently, in October, we awarded $200 to each of our frontline team members in support of our plan to invest more than $1 billion in our team for the year.  \n As we build our plans for the fourth quarter, our team focused first on flexibility and agility, knowing how volatile and unpredictable the external environment continues to be. We focused on leveraging Target's strengths, including the emotional connection between our brands and our guests and the convenience and speed of our stores-as-hub model. We're focused on listening to our guests to understand what they're experiencing, and they've told us that safety is one of their top concerns. So on top of our goal to be the easiest place to shop, we're committed to being the safest place to shop as well. \n In support of that goal, we've implemented a number of technology improvements to make shopping at Target more contact-free. These include an enhancement to our self-service lanes, which means guests no longer need to use the hand scanner to pay with their wallet function in our app. We made changes to Drive Up that eliminate the need for a team member to scan a guest phone when they deliver an order. We've rolled out a new capability on Target.com, allowing guests to check in, in advance to see whether we're currently metering traffic in their store and allow them to reserve a spot in line before leaving home. In addition, we have altered our promotional cadence to avoid events that typically cause crowd. And we announced that we'll be closed on Thanksgiving and open at the regular time on Black Friday.  \n Rather than concentrating holiday deals around Thanksgiving and Black Friday, we've spread our Black Friday offers throughout the entire month of November with weekly promotions spread across different categories throughout the month. And in the spirit of transparency and trust, we've assured our guests that they see any of our Black Friday items for a lower price later in this season, we'll happily make up the difference through our extended price match policy. \n To minimize lines, we've added more than 1,000 mobile checkout devices across the chain, allowing our team members to help guests check out anywhere in the store. We've also added thousands of gift items eligible for same-day fulfillment. And we're entering the holiday season with more than double the number of Drive Up parking spaces compared with a year ago.  \n In addition, we've added fresh, refrigerated and frozen items to our Pick Up and Drive Up assortment in more than 1,600 locations across the country, making this the first holiday season in which guests from coast-to-coast can use these convenience services to pick up everything they need for a holiday meal.  \n We're also continuing to expand the number of our merchandise categories available through our Shipt service, most recently adding kids and adult apparel. This change provides a new contactless option for guest to shop these categories and have them delivered to their front doors in as little as an hour.  \n While many things will be different this year, our guests have told us that they still plan to celebrate the holidays, and we know they'll be looking to Target for some holiday magic. \n That's why we're so excited about our recently announced partnership with FAO Schwarz. New for this holiday season, Target and FAO Schwarz have collaborated on an exclusive 70-piece toy collection with many items priced under $20. This collection will be available at Target stores nationwide, on Target.com and the flagship FAO Schwarz store in New York City.  \n Beyond this unique election, this holiday, we've created our biggest ever list of Top Toys, including more than 600 exclusive items, which will feature at an incredible value all-season long.  \n In decor, we're focused on bringing Target's brand promise to life by offering value and quality with hundreds of ornaments priced at $3, $5 and $10. \n On Target.com, more and more of our guests are shopping for decor using See It In Your Space technology, which makes our digital shopping experience more inspiring than ever. This feature allows guests to visualize what Christmas trees will look like in their homes as they prepare to decorate for the holiday. Guests who utilize this 3D rendering feature are 2x more likely to purchase a tree compared with an average digital guest.  \n In speaking with our guests, we know that finding the right gift can be a source of stress during the holiday. So this year, to make it easier than ever for our guests to share the joy, we've expanded our gifting assortment, including items for even the toughest individual on their list. With many items priced at $15 or less, we are offering incredible value, making it easier to celebrate the season with family and friends. \n And while the holiday season is top-of-mind right now, we shouldn't forget that the fourth quarter also includes a full month after the holiday. We're planning to kick off the new year on a positive note with a focus on wellness and nutrition, new exclusives in Beauty and the introduction of seamless T-shirt, fleece and performance bottoms to celebrate the 1-year anniversary of our new activewear brand, All in Motion. \n And speaking of Beauty, we couldn't be more excited about our new long-term strategic partnership with Ulta Beauty, which we announced last week. Because it embodies book style and frequency, the Beauty category is ideally suited to our strategy and it's one of our strongest growing categories over the last few years. This new partnership will help us to build on that success, providing our guests access to dozens of new beauty brands nationwide with elevated service and presentation in select store locations. \n We plan to open the first 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops later in 2021 with the potential to open 100 more in the years beyond.  \n So now before I close, I want to provide a brief update on our plans for Target's 2021 Financial Community Meeting. While no one can accurately predict the future of the coronavirus and the impact of potential vaccines, we have decided to host this meeting virtually in 2021. We made this decision out of an abundance of caution in keeping with our focus on the safety of our team and our investors. We look forward to hosting it again in person beginning in 2022.  \n So now as I get ready to turn the call over to John, I want to come back where I started and acknowledge our amazing team. When I arrived at Target a little more than 6 years ago, I already knew that Target is an academy company, a place that attracts and develops the level of talent that's the envy of other companies. That was already true before I arrived, and I couldn't be more proud of the team investments we've made in recent years, investments intended to cement Target's position as an inclusive home for top talent.  \n What I didn't appreciate until I became and immersed with this team is the warmth of the culture and the team's sincere desire for Target to play a positive role in the world. This desire often shows through in our marketing and our assortment and you could certainly see it in our stores. But for those of us who had the privilege of working with every part of this team, we see it every day behind the scenes even when no one else is looking. \n So I'll close with a simple thank you to this team for your passion to make Target a welcoming place for all families and a great place to work for everyone on the team. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John for an update on our operations and plans for the holiday season. John? Thank you. I want to reinforce Michael's commentary on our connection to families, which is so fundamental to our strategy. It's right at the center of our corporate purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. As we enter the holiday season at the end of a truly remarkable year, we're humbled and gratified at the number of families who have turned to Target to help them stay connected this year. We've helped them to find everything they need for a birthday party, including the decor, the food, the presents and a card. We created registries for couples getting married and for parents excited to celebrate the birth of a new child. We've helped our guests to stay connected from a distance with a new mobile phone or tablet. And we've helped them enjoy the additional time they're spending at home, whether that was new decor, office equipment, toys, video games or even activewear now that it's become work appropriate in a world in which all meetings are virtual. \n Even though the holidays will be different this year, we know our guests still want to discover the joy and connect with those closest to them. So our team is focused on helping to make that happen while providing helpful and friendly service in a safe environment during the busiest time of the year. \n So with that, we'll move to Q&A. John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Well, Chris, it's Brian. Why don't I start out, give everyone a sense for how we're viewing the holiday season. And we've spent a lot of time talking to guests throughout the year. And as it pertains to the holiday, they're clearly telling us that they want to celebrate this holiday season, but they know it's going to be very different: smaller gatherings, those trips that we used to take will be postponed. But we certainly expect that the guests that we serve is going to look for ways to find that little bit of joy during the holiday season. \n They've reacted very positively to our new promotional plan to start early and actually make those deals available throughout the holiday season. We've heard very positive responses to closing on Thanksgiving and really minimizing those big traffic-driving occasions that we've seen in the past. \n So we expect this to be a season that's going to be very different, unlike any other we've ever seen. But we expect that guests will decorate their home, and there'll be gifts under the tree and they'll find special ways to celebrate the holiday season. And they'll turn to  Target and our multi-category portfolio and our suite of fulfillment services as a way to make that happen. First, to be really clear, our focus will always be on curation and making sure we balance the right mix of our own brand and select national brand partners. And that will be an approach we'll take for years to come. So we're very excited about some of our new partnerships and working now with Levi's. And next year, in 2021, welcoming Ulta Beauty to our stores and to Target.com. But we'll always be curators and finding the right mix for our guests between our own brands and iconic national brands. Stephanie, we've talked about the number of new guests that have turned to Target during the pandemic. As John and Michael and I referred to in our opening comments, we're seeing a guest shop multiple categories, take advantage of our vast multi-category portfolio. Some days, they're shopping our stores. Some days, they're taking advantage of our same-day fulfillment services. And we expect that to continue. So the guests that are shopping our stores right now are taking advantage of the multiple categories that we sell. They are shopping in apparel and home. They're coming into Hardlines and Food & Beverage. They're taking advantage of our Beauty offerings as well as Household Essentials. And again, some days, we see them taking advantage of the investments we've made to create a safe shopping experience in-store. And other days, they're taking advantage of the ease and convenience of our same-day fulfillment services. Yes. It's Brian. I'd only add and really recognize the great work our merchants teams have done throughout the pandemic and certainly in the third quarter, making sure that we quickly adjust assortment to make sure it's relevant for the guests in today's environment. And I think you'll expect to see that in the fourth quarter as well. \n But our merchants have worked very closely with our key vendor partners to make sure we're making the adjustments and we've got the relevant items in our stores and online that guests are looking for today. And that's certainly been a big part of our success throughout 2020. John, you want to talk about small formats in 2020 and some of the outlook that we have for 2021? Karen, why don't I start? I think as we've looked at the holiday season, we expected the guests to start shopping earlier but continue to shop throughout the holiday season right up to Christmas eve. So we think it's going to be a prolonged shopping season. I think we're going to see very different shopping patterns. We don't expect to see those big spikes during Black Friday and on weekends. I think it's going to be spread across the holiday season. \n And we think December is going to be a very important gifting season for our guests. So we're watching it carefully. And again, we'll put a premium on flexibility and agility as we work through the months of November and December. But all indications, as we've talked to the consumer and talked to the guests is they're going to look to celebrate this holiday season. They're going to be focused on gifting and celebrating with their family and close friends. And we expect them to be in our stores and shopping online right till the very end of the holiday season. Karen, right now, we're very focused on the first half of 2021. And this is going to be a familiar theme: really taking some of the lessons learned from 2020, putting a premium on flexibility and agility because as Michael and I have both said, we, unfortunately, don't have that crystal ball as we look to the future. We're all looking for greater certainty. But we know we're going to go into the first half of 2021 facing the continued pandemic, waiting for vaccines, looking for greater clarity around the condition of the economy and unemployment. And I think we're going to just have to make sure that we remain flexible and provide the assortment and the services and the safety that the guest is looking for from Target. \n We certainly expect certain trends will continue. We think guests will continue to consolidate the number of locations where they shop. We think our multi-category portfolio will continue to be very important as we serve the needs of families. We think ease and convenience, combined with safety, will continue to be important. And we'll continue to deliver great value. \n So Michael talked about our continued focus on market share and the market share opportunities that are in front of us, and I think we'll be very focused on continuing to build off of the market share gains that we achieved in 2020 and further share opportunities in 2021. Yes. Why don't I start and then I'll ask for both John and Michael to provide a perspective. \n But I'll start with the recognition that on an average week, we see well over 30 million guests shopping our stores. And as you've seen in our third quarter results, we've seen traffic continue to grow at a rate of 4.5%, basket expand over 15%, and certainly, there are a mix of new guests to Target. \n But the Target guests and the families that shop us each and every week are visiting us more frequently. They're certainly shopping more categories. And that's creating greater trips either to our stores or to our fulfillment channels, and they're shopping a wider array of categories to take advantage of our multi-category portfolio.  So we're seeing both growth with our existing guests and new guests to Target and to Target.com. \n Mike, can you give perspective on top-tier versus lower-tier store performance? So I think the only thing I'd add is we look at our performance, our comps by geography each and every week. And we're seeing very consistent results literally across the country. From both coasts and the heartland of America and in the Southern market, really consistent comp and growth performance. So certainly, it's not 1 or 2 markets that are driving it. It's not our top-tier stores versus some of our lower-volume stores. We're seeing a consistent lift across the entire fleet of stores and obviously very strong growth in our digital channels. John, you want to start with Shipt and then we'll wrap up with Target Plus. And Robby, on Target Plus, our approach continues to be the same. We're very selectively curating some vendor partners. I think we're up to about 175 right now. We probably have now close to 400,000 SKUs available through Target Plus. But we'll continue to make sure we curate very carefully and complement our store and online assortment. \n So with that, I do want to thank everyone for joining us today. I wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. We look forward to the day when we can all be back together in person. \n But thanks for joining us. Thanks for your support, and have a safe and happy holiday season."

            "content": "Thanks, John. Similar to each of our every day lives since the onset of the coronavirus, hardly anything in our P&L has felt the same as before. But a few factors are most important in understanding our business results so far this year. \n First off, for the headwinds of which there have been several, including merchandising mix, digital fulfillment costs and an avalanche of first quarter apparel markdown. In addition, we've invested nearly $1 billion in additional pay and benefits for our team, along with safety measures to protect both our team and our guests. Yet in the face of those pressures, our business has delivered outstanding profit. And while there are various places on the P&L where you can see the favorability, they all tie back to the $10 billion of incremental sales that John mentioned earlier. \n On the expense line, this growth has resulted in an extraordinary amount of leverage, which has more than offset the pressure from additional costs. \n In addition, this year's unusually strong growth has resulted in exceptionally low markdown rates as I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes. \n When you pull back from the detail, it's clear that our business has been able to deliver both incredible top line growth and strong bottom line results. This is a hallmark of the durable model we've been building over the last few years. \n Our third quarter comparable sales increase of 20.7% reflects the continued pattern of trip consolidation by our guests as our average transaction size grew by more than 15% on top of very healthy traffic growth of 4.5%. Total sales grew 21.3%, about 60 basis points faster due to sales in new and nonmature stores. \n On the gross margin line, we recorded a rate increase of about 80 basis points in the third quarter, driven by the net impact of 3 separate factors. The first is the benefit of our merchandising efforts, which contributed well over 2 percentage points to our gross margin rate in the quarter. While there are many individual factors within this larger bucket, the most notable is on the markdown line as we saw exceptionally low promotional and clearance markdown rate. On the promotional markdown line, we've seen a year-over-year benefit since the pandemic began. And the reason is simple: when unit volume in commodity categories is so high that production is struggling to keep up with demand, it makes sense to stick with our low everyday prices and reduce the number of stock-up and other volume-driving promotions, which would only increase the number of out-of-stocks faced by our guests. \n On the clearance markdown line, we've seen even more favorability, and the reason is somewhat different. As demand for our noncommodity categories has stayed persistently higher than expected, we've sold a higher-than-average mix of our units at regular price with fewer-than-expected units sold on clearance discounts at the end of the season. Even more notable, favorability on the clearance line has been the primary driver of our overall markdown favorability on a year-to-date basis despite the exceptionally high apparel markdowns we recorded in the first quarter. \n Offsetting the benefit of our merchandising efforts, there were 2 distinct headwinds to gross margin in the third quarter. The first was from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs, which drove about 110 basis points of pressure, driven by rapid growth, digital fulfillment, along with incremental team member pay, benefits and safety costs for our supply chain team members. The other gross margin headwind came from category sales mix, which was worth about 60 basis points of pressure as lower-margin categories grew faster than higher-margin categories during the quarter. \n On the SG&A expense line, we recorded about 180 basis points of favorability in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the favorability on this line reflects exceptionally strong cost leverage due to sales growth of more than 20%. This benefit was so strong, it was able to offset about $300 million of incremental investments in team member pay and benefit, along with safety measures to protect our team and our guests. \n On the D&A line, dollars were down about 6% from a year ago worth about 70 basis points of rate improvement as we continued to annualize higher levels of accelerated depreciation on last year's larger remodel program. \n Altogether, the business delivered an exceptionally high operating margin rate of 8.5%, more than 3 percentage points higher than last year. On a dollar basis, operating income grew more than $900 million or more than 90% compared with last year. \n On the interest expense line, we recognized a $512 million loss on debt extinguishment related to a debt tender offer we executed in October. \n In light of our higher profitability, income taxes grew by about $90 million compared with last year. \n On the bottom line, despite the loss on debt extinguishment, which was equivalent to $0.75 of pressure, third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations established a new record high of $2.01, representing an increase of 46% compared with $1.37 last year. Adjusted EPS, which excluded the debt extinguishment loss and a couple of other small factors in both years, also established a new record high of $2.79, more than 100% higher than $1.36 last year. \n Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. Specifically, through the first 3 quarters of the year, our operations have delivered just over $7 billion of cash, which is nearly $3 billion more than a year ago. Obviously, our profit performance is an important factor in this increase, but we also continued to benefit from unusually high payables leverage, which is running well over 100%. Consistent with my comments last quarter and despite the inventory growth John mentioned earlier, we would have chosen to have less cash at the end of the quarter and more inventory if that option had been available. \n In light of the continued strength of our cash generation and resulting cash position on our balance sheet, our treasury team recently elected to take a couple of actions. The first was the execution of a debt tender offer in October, in which we invested $2.3 billion of cash to retire $1.8 billion of high coupon long-term debt. This transaction created significant economic value and it will significantly reduce future interest costs. In addition, it allowed us to deploy the bulk of the extra cash we added in the first quarter when, like many other well-capitalized companies, we chose to take on additional liquidity insurance at a time of extreme uncertainty following the onset of the pandemic. \n The other decision was made earlier this month when we terminated a supplementary 364-day credit facility, which was also added during the period of extremely high uncertainty during the first quarter. \n Beyond those actions, we also announced today that we have lifted the share repurchase suspension that we initially announced in the first quarter. We don't intend to engage in any repurchases before the end of the holiday season, but under appropriate conditions, we would look to reinitiate repurchases in 2021. As a reminder, we currently have $4.5 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September of 2019. \n As always, the timing and quantity of repurchase activity will be governed by our decades-long capital deployment goals: we first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria; second, we support our dividend and look to build on our nearly 50-year record of annual increases in our dividend per share; and finally, we deploy any excess cash beyond the first 2 uses to repurchase our shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. These capital priorities have served us well for decades and have played a critical role in supporting both strong operations and a strong balance sheet over time. \n In terms of capital deployment, we made capital investments of about $600 million in the third quarter, bringing our total for the year to just over $2 billion. \n We continue to expect full year CapEx in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, below our original expectation of about $3.5 billion, driven primarily by the reduction in remodel activity following the onset of COVID-19. \n We paid dividends of $340 million in the third quarter, reflecting a 3% increase in the dividend per share, partially offset by a decline in share count. And of course, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter in light of the suspension I mentioned earlier. \n Turning now to our after-tax return on invested capital. Our business delivered an extraordinarily high 19.9% in the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, up nearly 5 percentage points from 15% a year ago. While our longer-term plans have focused on delivering higher after-tax ROIC over time, the acceleration over the last 2 quarters has been well beyond anything we would have expected. And given that our inventories have been consistently lower than we'd prefer, we gladly would have traded some cash for more inventory over the last 2 quarters even though that would have driven this metric somewhat lower. \n So now before I close, I want to comment a little bit about our outlook. While we stopped driving financial guidance back in the first quarter, I want to outline a number of important considerations as we move into the holiday season and the fourth quarter overall. The first is the continued headwinds facing the consumer and the economy. In light of uncertainty around the path of the pandemic and continued elevated levels of unemployment. \n Offsetting this pressure, beginning with the onset of the pandemic, there has been a significant change in the mix of consumer spending as a meaningful portion has shifted away from travel and multiple forms of out-of-home entertainment and into many of the categories we sell. \n We also continue to benefit from trip consolidation as consumers have increasingly relied on our stores and digital services to satisfy a wide variety of their wants and needs in a single trip. \n Beyond these macro trends, there are a number of more specific considerations as we enter the holiday. The first is the expected change in the category mix of our fourth quarter business as typically both our electronics and toy categories generate half their annual sales in the fourth quarter. Given that both of these categories have seen dramatically stronger sales since the pandemic began, it's more difficult than usual to predict how the pattern will play out in the fourth quarter. \n Similarly, the digital mix of our sales, an important factor in our overall profitability, typically reaches a seasonal peak in the fourth quarter. This year, it's difficult to predict how high our digital mix will become given that we've already seen dramatically higher levels of digital penetration all year. \n So the natural question is, once you quantify all the potential headwinds and tailwinds you've just outlined, what's your fourth quarter forecast? Well, I think that's a great question. The reality is that none of us can accurately predict the future as all of us are facing a much higher level of uncertainty compared with a normal year. That's the reason why we've suspended financial guidance, but that doesn't mean we can't affect the outcome. As I've mentioned before, we continue to prioritize flexibility as we plan our business and focus on agility in our operations. That way, when the unexpected happens, our team can respond quickly and effectively as you've seen so far this year. \n Looking ahead to next year, the crystal ball doesn't get any clearer. Not only is it uncertain when the coronavirus will be fully behind us, it's also unclear how the consumer will behave in a post-COVID world. That creates uncertainty about the path of multiple categories as you consider how the mix of consumer spending will evolve and what the competitive landscape will look like. In adapting to that new world, we'll need to understand what that will mean for our business and how the financial metrics that have been dramatically changed this year will settle down over time. And today, while we can't answer these questions any more accurately than you can, it's clear that flexibility and agility will continue to be vitally important. \n So while specific metrics will continue to be difficult to predict, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our business and our ability to outperform. That's because based on the hard work of our team over the last few years, we now have a business model that's demonstrated its ability to deliver market share growth and profitability across a range of environments that's been far wider than any of us would have expected. And importantly, in a time where virtually nothing has stayed consistent, the one reliable through line across weeks and product categories has been consistent share gains throughout the year. \n In addition, we've seen a massive increase in guest engagement this year as they ventured into new categories and service at Target. And as I mentioned in our first quarter call, we've long known that engagement with guests at a time when their habits are changing is an incredibly important factor in deepening long-term loyalty. It's the reason we prioritize the Back-to-College season when many consumers are moving away from home for the first time. It's also the reason we're there for young couples when they get married and when they have children because our relationship with young families has long been a foundational aspect of our strategy. \n But most importantly, our team is a huge reason why we're confident in our future. We've long told you that we have the best team in retail, and this year's experience has demonstrated why we feel that way. Throughout the year, our team has stayed optimistic, they've taken care of each other, they've offered friendly service to our guests and they've successfully overcome a host of unforeseen challenges. The longer I've been at Target, the more I've seen how our team is Target's secret sauce, and I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of them for everything they've accomplished so far this year. \n With that, I'll turn it back over to Brian for some final thoughts. Brian? Sure. I can take that one. When you think about the drivers in Q3, the north of 200 basis points of good news from a bucket of levers within merchandising. The single biggest of those, for certain, was markdown efficiency. And we've seen continued efficiency on the promo markdown line throughout the year. \n And then clearance, and so much of that is a function of our sales -- our higher-than-expected sales in some of the seasonal categories. As you guys well know, a big part of our recipe for assortment in stores is bringing seasonal relevance and newness. In Q3, we changed over a lot of the store heading into the fall. And we had sold through a greater degree of that assortment this year than we typically see, and that provided some real tailwind on the margin line in Q3. \n When it comes to Q4, as one said, Q4 is always its own animal. So we build Q4 bottom-up with a clean sheet of paper and that's the way we've done it this year with admittedly a few more uncertainties in that equation than we might have typically. But we feel really good about, importantly, how our inventory is positioned heading into the holiday season. And we expect and feel good about our prospects for the quarter looking forward and the strength of the multi-category assortment and the strength of our fulfillment options and the ease and convenience that we'll be able to bring the guests should bode well for the fourth quarter as well. Yes. I'll take that really quickly. As you'd imagine, given just the magnitude of the number of stores, those tiers tend to move in unison. So we talked about the top tier being up, the bottom tier move the same amount. And any individual store will have its own story. But in quartile, they tend to move pretty consistently."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation second quarter earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 19, 2020. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, John and Michael will provide their perspective on the second quarter and our continued focus on our guests and our team as we navigate through the current environment. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and our focus going forward. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're sharing second quarter results that are, by virtually any measure, exceptional. But I want to say at the outset that what's most extraordinary of all is the environment in which we generated those results. The incredible resilience of our team, the way they've risen first to the pandemic, then to social trauma touched off in May here in Minneapolis is unlike anything I've seen or I'm likely to see again in my career. And I say in all humility that it has been a huge privilege to work alongside this team in this moment. \n The results we reported this morning are truly unprecedented. On the top line, we delivered second quarter comparable sales growth of 24.3%, the strongest we've ever reported. Equally remarkable on the bottom line, we generated adjusted EPS of $3.38, a new record high and strong enough to offset the significant profit headwind we faced in the first quarter. These results are a testament to our team and their passion for our guests and the increasing trust our guests are placing in our brand. \n Our performance also reflects the meaningful investments we've made in recent years, building a business model that is durable enough to perform in any environment, incorporating flexibility in both our merchandise assortment and the fulfillment options we offer to our guests, while articulating a unified purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. In our last earnings call, we described how our business and operations adapted quickly and seamlessly to rapid changes in consumer behavior. As our guests reacted to the implications of the emerging pandemic, we encountered multiple abrupt changes in shopping patterns throughout the first quarter, both across categories and channels. Near the end of that quarter, we returned to growth in our store sales and once again saw growth in categories like apparel. This improved sense of balance in both channel and category mix continued through the second quarter, and we didn't see the dramatic swings we experienced in the first quarter. \n In terms of channel mix, we saw very healthy growth across the board, with store-originated comparable sales growing 10.9% and digital comp sales up nearly 200%. It's worth pausing to acknowledge that at just under 11%, this store-only comp stacks up as one of the best in our history and yet, it happened at a time when American consumers are adopting digital shopping like never before. \n In addition, as I've mentioned in previous calls, channel numbers don't tell the full story because they don't measure the benefit of our work to position our stores as hubs at the center of our digital fulfillment. When you look beneath the surface of the reported numbers, you find that our stores actually drove more than 90% of our second quarter growth, given that they enabled more than 3/4 of our digital sales and an even higher percentage of our digital growth. Store-based fulfillment is uniquely suited to our business model because of the way it fits within our overall strategy. In particular, it aligns with our merchandising approach, which is based on curation, both in our stores and online assortments. As a result, the majority of our digital demand is driven by items that are already available in our stores, which positions us to efficiently rely on those locations to fulfill the demand. \n Among our store-enabled digital fulfillment options, we continue to see the most rapid growth in our same-day offerings in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt. These services offer speed, reliability, convenience and value to our guests. They are digital capabilities enhanced by human interaction, even though they're contactless. This explains why they generate some of the highest levels of satisfaction of anything we provide. \n Together, our same-day services saw more than 270% comp growth in the second quarter, outpacing overall digital growth. Among these services, we saw the fastest growth in Drive Up, which grew an astonishing 734%. We also saw incredible growth in Target sales fulfilled by Shipt, which were up more than 350%. However, even though we have offered pickup in all of our locations for more than 5 years, in-store pickup sales increased more than 60% in the quarter. \n Across all 5 of our core merchandising categories, we delivered very strong share gains in the quarter, driven by the acceleration in our discretionary businesses, combined with continued strength in our frequency categories. We mentioned in the first quarter that we had already gained a year's worth of market share in the quarter alone. Rather than slowing down, our share gains accelerated in the second quarter, and we gained double the dollars compared with the first quarter, bringing our year-to-date share gains to more than $5 billion. \n Among our discretionary categories, we saw the most dramatic comp acceleration in apparel, which moved from a 20% decline in the first quarter to double-digit growth in the second quarter. Hardlines generated the strongest comp overall at more than 40%. This was the result of an even stronger increase in electronics of more than 70% as guests continue to focus on office equipment, home electronics and gaming. Not surprisingly, our guests heightened focus on staying at home was also evident in our home category, we saw more than 30% growth, with particular strength in decor, domestics and kitchenware. Beauty also saw healthy acceleration, doubling its first quarter growth rate to more than 20% in the second quarter. Our less discretionary Food & Beverage and Essentials categories each saw second quarter comp sales growth of about 20%. For both categories, this was slightly slower than we saw in the first quarter, which was marked by dramatic stock-up shopping as the pandemic emerged. \n At a time when every retailer is facing increased uncertainty and unforeseen challenges, we have chosen to continue investing in our business and particularly in our team. Following hundreds of millions of dollars in team investments in the first quarter, in June, we announced that beginning July 5, we would currently raise our starting wage for U.S. team members to $15 per hour. Additionally, we announced a onetime bonus of $200 to our frontline store and distribution center hourly workers in recognition of their efforts throughout this extraordinary year. \n We also announced free access to virtual doctor visits for all team members through the end of the year, regardless of whether they currently subscribe to a Target health care plan. And we announced additional extensions of our 30-day paid leave for vulnerable team members and free backup care for family members. As I've mentioned before, the return on these team investments may be hard to quantify in a spreadsheet, but I am confident that they have been among the most important investments we've made over the last few years. \n In late May into June, our team had to navigate the challenges presented by the killing of George Floyd and the civil unrest that it sparked nationwide. While we all experienced the heartbreak caused by the murder itself, our initial focus was on the safety of our team. As a result, in areas affected by unrest, we closed locations or reduced operating hours, affecting hundreds of our stores across the country. Most of these stores were able to safely resume normal operations in a matter of a few days, but a handful of locations sustained more significant damage. All but 2 of those stores have already reopened, and we're hoping to have those locations reopened by the end of the year. Through it all, I'm happy and grateful to say that none of our team experienced physical harm through the unrest. \n But beyond physical safety, our team is passionately demanding equity and justice for our black colleagues and guests. We are united in that passion and committed to supporting our team while playing an active role in addressing the persistent racial injustices that have sparked protests around the world. Beyond our team's volunteer efforts across the country, we have dedicated $10 million, half from corporate giving and half from our foundation towards Twin City rapid response needs, local rebuilding efforts and national social justice initiatives. \n We've also formed a committee called REACH, consisting of senior leaders who have come together based on their experience and expertise. Together, they represent a broad enterprise view, and their work is focused on advancing racial equity for our black team members and guests across all areas of Target's business. To deliver the most impact across our business, REACH is aligned around 4 key areas of focus: team, guests, communities and civic engagement and public policy. With their help, we're putting our influence to work in our hometown and in the country, bringing together our team, our neighbors, other businesses and community partners to determine actions and resources that will move us towards a more inclusive, equitable and just society. \n Now let's turn to our plans for the third quarter and beyond. Our research tells us that guests still want to celebrate seasons and holidays even as they acknowledge that things will be different in this new environment. To help our guests adapt to these changes, we're building flexibility into our merchandising and operations to allow our guests to celebrate the season in new ways. Knowing that many parents about the country are still facing uncertainty about whether their children will be attending school in person or virtually, we'll be featuring our Back-to-School assortment for an extended period this year, allowing parents to delay shopping until they have more certainty on their school district plans. \n In Back-to-College markets, we'll be moving in-store shopping events outside into our parking lots and highlighting contactless options like Drive Up. Across the chain, we'll be promoting the wallet feature within the Target app as a fast, contactless alternative to paying with a physical card. And for Halloween, we'll continue to feature costumes and decor to celebrate the season. But we'll be adjusting our candy merchandising in anticipation of a reduction in trick or treating this year. In addition, we'll be giving away surprise boo bags to our Drive Up guests in October, featuring surprises along with tips and suggestions for celebrating the season. Also this fall, we'll roll out the third and final phase of our Good & Gather assortment, adding more than 600 items to bring the total number of items to nearly 2,000. \n The Good & Gather brand is clearly resonating with our guests and delivering on our Food & Beverage vision to enhance the Target experience by making it easy for families to discover the joy of food. We launched this new flagship brand less than a year ago, and it has already generated more than $1 billion in sales. With the momentum from this new brand, our own-brand Food & Beverage business has been growing more than 30% so far this year, significantly outpacing the market and growing market share. \n Beyond Good & Gather, we continue to benefit from an unmatched portfolio of owned and exclusive brands that spans our entire assortment. Together, these brands whose sales have outgrown national brands so far this year, offer guests quality and style at an unmatched value while enhancing Target's differentiation and delivering attractive gross margin rates. \n In June, we launched Casaluna, a collection of more than 700 quality bedding and bath items featuring elevated natural and sustainable materials like linen, hemp, silk, cashmere, all at an amazing value. And of course, it was only in January that we launched our new activewear brand, All in Motion, and the timing couldn't have been better. All in Motion was designed with a commitment to quality, sustainability and inclusivity at incredible Target prices. As guests across the country have moved to working from home, they embraced the quality, comfort and value provided by this new brand, driving sales well beyond our original expectations. \n Also this quarter, Target Circle will be celebrating its 1-year anniversary of its national rollout. At more than 75 million members, Circle has exceeded our expectations in its first year. To celebrate, we'll be highlighting Circle in our marketing with a focus on driving acquisition and engagement in advance of the fourth quarter shopping season. \n And finally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we're focusing first on guests and in team member safety, developing plans to reduce crowds and spread out demand throughout the season. Specifically, we'll be spreading our best-priced holiday offers over a longer time frame, beginning in October, so guests can shop safely and conveniently without worrying about missing out on deals that usually come only late in the season. We've also announced that we'll be closing stores on Thanksgiving, sending a clear signal to guests that they won't need to stand in line and crowd into stores to get a great deal. \n In addition, we'll be making thousands of additional items available via same-day services this holiday season, including more gifts, essentials and everything in between. In addition, as John will describe in more detail, we'll offer fresh and frozen grocery items, via Order Pick Up and Drive Up at more than 1,500 Target stores this fall. \n As I said in the beginning, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the performance they've delivered on behalf of our guests. As we focus on transforming our business over the last few years, we began with a focus on our guests and how we could better serve them by leveraging our strengths. We emerged from that effort with a durable business model, differentiated from our competitors and designed to perform in a variety of environments. \n When we contemplated the range of environments we might face, I don't think anyone could claim that they knew what we'd be facing today. Yet in the face of unprecedented changes in the environment, our business is doing what it's designed to do: It's delivering convenience, reliability, safety and value, driving increased engagement and trust among our guests. It's supporting and rewarding our team, the best team in retail. It's playing a positive role in the communities where we live and work. It's generating strong, sustainable business results in the support of our shareholders and is accomplishing these results by relying on our stores when many others are walking away from their physical locations. \n As we look ahead, we're prepared to navigate through a host of potential challenges, including the ongoing threat from the coronavirus and economic headwinds resulting from high levels of unemployment. Yet, as we said in our last call, we have never been more confident in our differentiated strategy and our long-term potential. Throughout this crisis, we have deepened our relationship with American consumers and introduced millions of them to our digital fulfillment services. As a result, we've seen unprecedented growth in market share, a trend that we expect to continue. \n With a strong business and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to weather any near-term economic headwinds and continue to serve and delight our guests. Our team is ready and eager to seize the opportunity in front of us. \n Now I'll turn the call over to John, who will provide an update on operations and our plans going forward. John? \nJohn Hulbert: Thanks, Brian. If the overall theme of our first quarter was unexpected change and rapid adjustment, in the second quarter, it was an increasing sense of normalcy. I will quickly say things today are far from the old normal. In fact, hardly anything feels the same today as it did 6 months ago. And while second quarter trends were much less volatile than the first quarter, the team still had to navigate through a great deal of variability, something they've done exceptionally well throughout this crisis. But at this point, the team has gained significant experience with new routines, all centered around safety, and we've returned to many of the routines we paused during the first quarter. \n Now that our new cleaning routines are fully established, they are operating successfully in a run-state condition. We continually hear from our guests that safety is even more important than ever, and they appreciate that cleanliness and safety are visible priorities for our team across every aspect of what we do. \n In late April, we began accepting in-store returns again, following a 5-week pause. Soon after, in May, we began a phased reopening of the Starbucks locations in our stores. As the quarter progressed, many other activities resumed, including a steady reintroduction of the Weekly Ad in select markets and a resumption of a more normal cadence for handling clearance, promotions and merchandise transitions. \n In our Super Target locations, we initiated a contactless form of sampling in June, along with a phased-in plan to resume deli and bakery production. Across the chain, we reintroduced product samples into our pickup and Drive Up bags and began moving store hours back to their pre-pandemic levels. \n After opening 3 new store locations in March, we took a pause in our new store projects as uncertainty from the pandemic emerged. Since then, we have been ramping up our new store construction activity, and we are now on track to open up to 27 more stores this year. Nine of these new locations are slated to open this month with another 16 to 18 expected in October. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new small format stores, and our pipeline is expected to support 35 to 40 of these new locations annually in future years. \n Perhaps the most vivid example of our progress is the fact that we've resumed our plans to add fresh, refrigerated and frozen items to our pickup and Drive Up services. Going into the year, we had planned to roll out this capability to half or more of our stores this year. However, in March, given the severe swings we were seeing in store traffic and the onslaught of new routines we are asking our store teams to perform, we paused on this rollout to provide our team more time to focus on safely serving our guests. \n By the time of our first quarter call in May, we had already resumed the rollout. And since then, we have made more progress than we had originally planned for the full year. In fact, we are already offering an extended food assortment for Drive Up and pickup in more than 1,500 of our stores, far exceeding our original goal. By this holiday season, we expect to have this capability in nearly 1,600 stores. In addition, we've added adult beverages to our pickup and Drive Up assortments and more than 300 stores in selected markets. And we'll continue the rollout of both perishable items and adult beverages to additional locations next year. \n Our teams and systems are successfully handling the additional complexity that comes with these expanded assortments, and our guests are happy as well. They're telling us they appreciate the ability to receive these items without shopping our sales floor, providing them a contactless option when that is their preference. \n Following the introduction of an expanded assortment into markets, we see a steady increase in usage week after week as more guests learn about it. Our guests tell us they're eager for us to make even more items available, and we'll be exploring further assortment enhancements over the remainder of the year and beyond. \n Beyond assortment, we continue to implement process enhancements to our digital fulfillment services, driving both efficiency and speed for our guests. New this quarter, we introduced improvements to the Target app, allowing guests to toggle their fulfillment choice between pickup and Drive Up orders up until the point the guests arrives at the store. This option provides additional flexibility for the guests to update their fulfillment option as their plans change. \n Given the explosion in demand we've seen this year, we've been adding additional Drive Up spots in locations across the country. This additional capacity was contemplated in our original plan, but with the recent growth, we are adding these extra spots earlier than originally anticipated. The process is straightforward as we add 2 to 12 additional spots, depending on store-specific needs, repainting the parking stalls and using additional temporary signing to highlight the change. \n For our ship-from-store capability, we continue to roll out process improvements for processing orders and packing boxes, increasing efficiency and reducing waste. And we've also enhanced prioritization algorithms to ensure that the orders with the most time-sensitive items, including COVID-sensitive categories, are prioritized earliest for packing and shipping. \n While digital orders inherently involve more handling and more cost compared with conventional store transactions, we've been realizing meaningful improvements in average fulfillment cost per unit, reducing the impact of digital growth on our operating margin rate. These efficiencies are driven by multiple factors. First, as we continue to roll out new tools and processes, we have been seeing increased efficiency across each of our digital fulfillment options. Second, we are benefiting from favorable mix within digital fulfillment. As our same-day options continue to grow faster than overall digital growth, average unit costs go down because these options are much less costly compared with shipping to home. \n Third, we are seeing meaningful leverage on digital fulfillment given the unusually high-growth rates we've seen this year. Some of this leverage is more subtle than conventional fixed cost leverage. For example, as a store's Drive Up order volume increases, more and more of the time, our team is able to pick multiple orders together, gaining efficiency in the pick process. In addition, we realized a similar benefit in the parking lot where our teams are increasingly delivering multiple orders at a time, reducing the cost per order of that delivery trip to the parking lot. And finally, as we've seen meaningful trip consolidation this year, we realize a benefit as fixed order costs are spread across more items. \n Aggregating all of these benefits, our second quarter average unit costs for digital fulfillment was approximately 30% lower than a year ago. This provided a significant offset to the cost pressure we would otherwise be seeing from our unusually high rate of digital sales growth. \n While we'll always focus on driving efficiency and reducing costs, we embrace digital transactions because they drive guest engagement, which ultimately benefits every part of our business. Our most recent data indicates that a multichannel guest spends 4x as much as a store-only guest and 10x as much as a digital-only guest. Our research also continues to validate that after a guest tries Drive Up for the first time, we see a nearly 30% increase in their overall spending, including an increase in their conventional store shopping. It's particularly notable that this increase in store shopping is occurring despite the unusual environment in which consumers are minimizing time spent in public places. However, the data certainly provides some additional context for the unprecedented growth of more than 10% in conventional store sales we reported this quarter. \n As we gain new digital guests in unprecedented numbers, we are also seeing higher engagement from these guests than we've seen in the past. Specifically, among our new digital guests in the first quarter, we've seen nearly double the rate of repeat purchases within 7 days compared with a year ago. And the rate of repeat purchases in the intervening 90 days has been fully double what we measured a year ago. Given that we've added 10 million new digital guests in the first half of the year, we feel good about our prospects for building on their elevated level of engagement over time. \n Now I want to spend a minute talking about our current inventory levels and in-stock performance. While we made a lot of progress in the second quarter, we are still facing challenges across multiple parts of our assortment driven by a couple of distinct factors. First, in many of our frequency categories, our vendors continue to face capacity constraints as they work to accommodate unexpectedly high demand across the U.S. While these vendors continue to ramp up production, and we have been successful in negotiating higher allocations for many of them, demand in our stores continues to outpace supply. As a result, on-shelf availability in many of these categories continues to look sparse even as our allocation quantities are increasing. We will continue to work with our vendor partners to make more progress in the back half of the year. \n Second, regarding import categories, we successfully increased receipts throughout the second quarter. But as Brian outlined earlier, we also have seen a meaningful acceleration in the pace of sales in these categories. Based on our current plans, we expect that our import inventory will reach last year's levels by the end of the third quarter and should expand well beyond last year's levels in the fourth quarter. \n And finally, I want to address the nagging questions we continue to hear regarding our capacity and ability to further scale our store-based fulfillment model. I've addressed this question multiple times in prior earnings calls, and I would think that our recent results would dispel these worries. But we clearly haven't convinced everyone yet, so we'll continue to provide facts to support our modeling. \n Here are some fun facts from the first half of this year. Of our $6-plus billion in comparable sales growth so far this year, conventional store sales have grown nearly $2 billion, while digital sales have expanded more than $4 billion. Our year-to-date digital sales of nearly $7 billion have already eclipsed our full year digital sales in 2019 even though the peak holiday shopping season is still ahead of us. Of this year's digital growth, sales on orders shipped from stores have grown more than $1.6 billion. Sales from our pickup and Drive Up services have also grown more than $1.6 billion so far this year, with Drive Up accounting for well over $1 billion of that growth. And of course, much of this year's growth has been unplanned, meaning that our systems and store teams have had to adjust quickly in real time. So again, we hope these facts help you put your capacity concerns at ease. But if not, we'll continue to address them in the future. \n With that, before I end my remarks, I want to pause and thank our team for their resilience, dedication and flexibility during a tumultuous year. It has been incredibly gratifying to watch how our team has adapted to unprecedented change, serving consumers in record numbers while staying laser-focused on what matters most: the safety of our guests and our fellow team members. \n While we all can't wait for the day when we can look at this pandemic in the rearview mirror, the reality is that it's not likely to end soon. In the meantime, we are committed to supporting each other and building on the foundation we've created over the last several years, allowing us to emerge from these tough times as an even stronger company with a deeper relationship with American consumers. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and our priorities going forward. Michael? \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While aspects of our second quarter performance could hardly have looked any more different than the first quarter, many of the themes we covered 3 months ago remain true today. Guests are consolidating trips and increasingly turning to Target as the flexibility of our assortment and fulfillment options make us a convenient one-stop shop. We're continuing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in paying benefits for our team and in new measures to enhance safety and cleanliness in our stores. We're seeing unprecedented market share gains across our multi-category assortment and in virtually every week. And we're focused on financial strength and flexibility as we look ahead given continued volatility and uncertainty in this environment. \n As Brian mentioned, our second quarter comp sales growth of 24.3% is the highest we've ever reported. Total sales grew 24.8%, reflecting 0.5 point of benefit from new and nonmature stores. Among the drivers of our comp growth, comparable traffic grew 4.6%, while average basket grew 18.8%, reflecting trip consolidation in both our stores and digital channels. \n Across those channels, store-originated comp sales grew 10.9%, meaning stores growth alone matched our total comp sales growth in the first quarter. On top of those store sales, digitally originated comp sales grew 195%, contributing another 13.4 percentage points to our total comp growth. \n Within digital, we continue to see the fastest growth in our same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, which together grew 273% over last year. As John mentioned, these services have much lower unit costs compared with the orders we ship to our guests, helping us to control costs even as our digital sales continue to explode. \n Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was about 30 basis points higher than last year. Among the tailwinds to gross margin, we saw about 180 basis points of rates benefit from core merchandising strategies, which played out most prominently in lower markdown rates compared with last year. \n In addition, we saw about 50 basis points of benefit from the change in the sales return reserve estimate that we held at the beginning of the quarter. Among the headwinds, digital fulfillment and supply chain costs accounted for a rate headwind of about 130 basis points, while category mix drove about 70 basis points of pressure. \n On the SG&A line, the second quarter results included $400 million of investments in team member pay and benefits and measures to protect the health and safety of our guests and team. However, these investments were more than offset by the leveraged benefit of exceptionally strong sales growth. And as John mentioned earlier, the benefits of this leverage extended well beyond strictly fixed costs, leading to an astounding reduction in our SG&A expense rate of about 180 basis points in the quarter. On the depreciation and amortization line, we also saw healthy leverage on a small reduction in dollars, driving about 60 basis points of rate favorability compared with last year. \n Altogether, our second quarter operating margin rate of 10% was about 280 basis points higher than a year ago. This performance was well outside anything I have seen in my 15 years at this company and certainly beyond anything we would have anticipated going into the quarter. However, these results followed a first quarter profit decline that was also well outside of anything I have ever seen or would have anticipated. \n As such, it's useful to look at the 2 quarters together and see how things have played out so far this year. On very strong comp sales growth of nearly 18% in the first half of 2020, our operating margin rate is about 30 basis points lower than last year, reflecting meaningful pressure on the gross margin line, mostly offset by rate improvements on both the SG&A and D&A expense lines. This performance translates to a very healthy operating income dollar growth of 12.6% for the first half of the year, which is a testament to the durability of our model in a very unusual environment. \n On the bottom line, our business generated second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.38 and GAAP EPS of $3.35, both up more than 80% compared to last year. Year-to-date, both of these measures have seen increases in the upper teens, stronger than we anticipated as we entered the year. \n Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment. Many of the themes we outlined in our last earnings call remain the same today. Regarding cash flow, we saw strong second quarter performance on top of a strong first quarter. As a result, through the first half of the year, we've generated cash from operations of about $5.1 billion, which is $2.3 billion higher than last year. The largest driver of this favorability is our inventory leverage, which was well above 100% at the end of the quarter. A portion of this leverage is the natural benefit of rapid sales growth, which increases inventory turnover and enhances payables leverage. However, as I mentioned last quarter, this benefit is exaggerated by our inventory position, which continues to be leaner than we want it to be. Specifically, at the end of the second quarter, our inventory position was 3% lower than a year ago compared with a year-to-date sales increase of more than 18%. Put another way, at the end of the quarter, we'd have preferred to have less cash and more inventory to support the frequency and import categories John highlighted earlier. And we have plans in place to invest in that stronger inventory position in the back half of the year, which will unwind a portion of the favorability you've seen in the front half. \n Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities remain the same as they have been for decades. We first invest fully in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and build on our nearly 50-year history of annual increases. And finally, we return any excess cash beyond these first 2 uses through share repurchases within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Regarding CapEx, we invested $660 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to just over $1.4 billion, slightly higher than last year. As John mentioned earlier, following a brief pause in the first quarter, we are back in the business of building and opening new stores, and we're on track to open nearly 30 new locations this year, just short of our original plan. However, given the dynamics of remodel projects, we are maintaining our revised plan to complete about 130 remodels this year, well below last year and our original plan. As a result, we are expecting 2020 CapEx in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, down from our original plan of about $3.5 billion for the year. \n Turning to dividends. We paid a total of $330 million in the second quarter, up from $328 million a year ago. And in June, our Board of Directors approved a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend, keeping us on track to deliver our 49th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. \n We didn't invest any cash in share repurchases in the second quarter following our first quarter announcement that we were suspending repurchases in the current environment. Today, if you looked casually at our current cash position and second quarter results, you might wonder if we were ready to resume share repurchase activity. And the answer to that question is not yet. While second quarter profitability was unexpectedly strong, it was only 90 days ago that we reported a quarterly profit decline of more than 60%, highlighting how volatile the environment has been and may continue to be. Moreover, as we look ahead, there are many potential challenges on the horizon, including uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, economic headwinds from historically high unemployment, uncertainty surrounding government stimulus and a contentious November election. So while we have very strong confidence in our long-term prospects, our ability to continue to expand market share and grow profitably over time, we believe it's the prudent, long-term decision to preserve liquidity in the current environment, giving us the flexibility to safely navigate through any near-term headwinds. \n So finally, I will close this section with a quick comment on our after-tax ROIC, which grew to 17.2% this quarter, up from 15.2% a year ago. Even though we report this metric on a trailing 12-month basis, it has been unusually volatile this year given the dramatic changes in performance we've seen. Specifically, at the end of the first quarter, this metric was nearly 4 percentage points lower than today at 13.4%, driven by the steep profit decline we faced in the first quarter. So while this metric may continue to move around during this period of heightened volatility, we will remain focused on making the right long-term investments in our business, allowing us to deliver higher after-tax returns over time. \n Now I want to turn briefly to our outlook. And consistent with last quarter, I won't be providing any precise guidance. However, I want to reinforce what I was just saying earlier, which is that we are moving through a period of unusually high uncertainty and volatility. And while John was correct that we felt a much stronger sense of normalcy in the second quarter, volatility continued to be elevated. Specifically within the second quarter, May was by far the strongest month with a 33% comp, followed by June at 21%, and July at about 20%. And so far in August, due largely to softer sales in our Back-to-School categories, month-to-date comp sales have been running in the low double digits. \n Now let me be clear, a double-digit increase is still quite strong in the context of history, but a 20 percentage point spread between our May and August to date comps is an incredibly wide swing within a few months, highlighting the difficulty of forecasting our business right now. So given that our Q1 performance was not a good predictor of our second quarter results, our Q2 results should not be viewed as a predictor of our performance going forward. And given that we can't eliminate uncertainty in the environment, we continue to place a premium on flexibility in our plans. This will allow us to quickly pivot when we see changes in our business, as you've seen us do successfully multiple times this year. \n So now I want to conclude my remarks in the same way I did 90 days ago by saying that a single quarter's financial results are not the basis for our long-term confidence. That confidence springs from the fact that we continue to focus on investing for the long term because Target's long-term prospects have never been brighter. We have a durable business model with flexibility in both our merchandising assortment and the fulfillment options we offer. We're building on an already deep relationship with our guests as they trust us like never before to conveniently and safely fulfill their wants and needs. And with a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, we have the capacity to navigate any near-term challenges and play offense, just like we have over the last few years. \n But most importantly, we have an amazing team across our stores, headquarters, distribution facilities and offices around the world. We have all rallied around a common purpose: to serve our guests, serve our communities, fight for racial equity and to support each other. All of us who work here know how special the team is. So I want to thank our entire team for all they are doing in this exceptional time and for making Target special, truly a company like no other. \n Now I'll turn it over to Brian for some final remarks. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to pause and thank everyone on the call today for listening in and for your continued engagement in our business. For those of you who've been on these calls for a while, I think you'd agree it's been quite a journey. In fact, when you look back at our release and remarks from the second quarter 5 years ago, you can quickly see how far we've come. In the second quarter 2015, we reported healthy growth in our earnings per share, with both GAAP and adjusted EPS expanding to just over $1.20 or more than $2 lower than the quarter we just reported. Digital sales grew 30% and accounted for just under 3% of our total sales compared with just over 17% this year. Five years ago, after-tax ROIC expanded 2 full percentage points to 13.3%, nearly 4 percentage points lower than the 17.2% we just reported. \n Among the priorities we covered in this call 5 years ago, becoming a leader in digital, having just introduced our ship-from-store capability, defining our category roles and reasserting our authority in style categories like apparel and home, and ramping up our test of the small-format stores in dense urban areas. Also in the quarter 5 years ago, we sold our pharmacy business to CVS and announced that John Mulligan will become the company's first Chief Operating Officer with a goal of modernizing our supply chain and operations. \n As in every upward journey, our progress over the last 5 years has not been a straight line. Along the way, we reached some plateaus and sometimes even lost some altitude before resuming the climb. That's why it's sometimes helpful to look back over a longer distance to get a true picture of the progress. \n But unlike the ascent of a mountain, our journey will not end up with a climb back down. Success will be defined by further growth with a constant eye on what consumers want and need. To meet those ever changing needs, we'll need to continue to reinvent ourselves, changing our operations along the way. \n Yet, some things will sustain over the longer term, like our culture, values and our team's commitment to one another. These strengths have defined this great company for decades, and our commitment to maintaining them has never been stronger. \n With that, we'll move to Q&A. John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Congratulations on a great quarter. I want to -- I don't want to take away from the success of the quarter because it obviously was outstanding. But I do want to focus on gross margin. Because I know while it's impossible to predict what things will like look on the top line, I think we probably have a pretty good handle on SG&A in terms of how that will look, obviously, depending on sales. But gross margin kind of in the back half seems to be a little more of a wildcard. So wondering if you could talk about that a little bit and I think in the context of that 180 basis points in rate benefits from lower markdowns. Because presumably, you had marked down things. And you pre-marked down in 1Q, and you're benefiting from that in 2Q. So we really have to look at the back half without that 180 basis points. And then I had one other quick follow-up. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, why don't you start? \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure, Karen. And maybe I'll start by saying, I empathize with those of you on this call trying to extract trends from our Q1 and Q2 margin rates. You can see the underlying volatility of the business if you pick apart those trends in Q1 and Q2. To focus for a second on where we've been, I actually think it's useful to zoom out and look at the year-to-date trends. If you unpack margin on a year-to-date basis, we've got just over 1 point of pressure from the accelerated growth in digital and supply chain investments and have just over 1 point of pressure in category mix. And you've got a wide variety of movement across the markdown front: some of the markdowns we took in Q1 were lower and then the benefit of more sales at reg price in Q2. And an example of that, Karen, is really, if you think about how -- the sell-through we're getting given our strong sales, we're taking a lot less product to clearance at the end of the season than we would typically. And so that's an example of one of those drivers of favorability that contributes to the 180 basis points of good news in Q2. \n Those will be key levers as we look ahead going forward. But like we said before, predicting them is an exercise in imprecision at this point. \nKaren Short: Okay. That's helpful. And then you gave us, obviously, a lot of color on your digital and fulfillment capabilities. But I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the new 10 million customers that you've gained. Anything you could point to on demographics, behavior, ticket type of behavior relative to your more regular customers? \nBrian Cornell: John, anything else you want to add? \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Karen, I'd say, the great thing is, is that from a behavior perspective, they behave just like the rest of our guests. When we convert someone to a Drive Up order, historically, we've seen them become more engaged with Target, see 30% more sales. That's exactly what we see with this 10%. \n Probably more encouraging from our perspective is that from a repeat purchase perspective, we've seen that increase. 7-day repeat purchases are higher than we have seen historically. 90-day repeat purchases on digital are higher than we have seen historically. So it appears that, at least to start with, they're much more engaged with us. And we know that the deeper they get engaged, the more they use our services, that the more they will be engaged and the more they will use our services. So from our perspective, very encouraging results as those guests have come on to Target.com. \nBrian Cornell: And Karen, the only thing I would add is we continue to see the most valuable and profitable guest to Target is the guest that uses all of our channels. And we continue to see stickiness as store guests discovers Drive Up or discovers the benefits of Shipt and also digital guests that are now coming into our stores because of the investments we've made and the trust we're building. So we'll continue to report more about those new guests in quarters to come. But certainly, we're very excited about what that means to our future. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I was just curious on the August comp, obviously, impressive results quarter-to-date given stimulus rolling off Back-to-School. I was hoping that you could provide a little bit of category color in terms of what you're seeing in August. \n And then as it relates to Back-to-School, I guess, what are your thoughts on how the season is going to end up? I mean obviously, we're getting off to a late start in a lot of areas. Just curious as to what you think the impact to the comp will end up being this quarter? \nBrian Cornell: Ed, why don't I start. And I commented earlier today that our August comps are off to a very solid start with low to mid-teen growth at this point in the month, and it's been broad-based. So we're continuing to see the kind of performance we saw in the second quarter continue into Q3: strength in food and Essentials, continued strength in electronics, continued to strength in home. And certainly, we've seen some adjustments in categories that are very school related as consumers look for greater certainty around when they're going to start the back-to-school season. But I think, again, the most important indicator right now, as I look at our August performance, is the consistent market share growth that we're seeing across our entire portfolio. \n And each and every week, as we look at IRI and NPD performance, we continue to see a lot of green boxes and continue to pick up market share across the board and across our entire multi-category portfolio. \n Obviously, we're all looking at Back-to-School and Back-to-College trends. And each and every day, there's new information. As we sit here today, and I think the number is there's something close to 56 million students in the K-12 bracket that are waiting to go back to school. And as of this week, it looks like well over 60% will start school remotely. And we'll look for more information. We don't know if those students will be welcomed back into a classroom in September or October. Many may wait actually until January. So we've made the decision to be flexible. And we'll extend the season and extend our assortment because we know at some point in time those students will need backpacks and uniforms. They're going to need school supplies, so we've got to make sure that we continue to flex. And I think it's been the hallmark of our performance throughout the first 2 quarters of this year, our ability to stay agile, stay flexible, meet the needs of the new environment, and we'll continue to take that approach with back-to-school season and with the back-to-college environment as well. \nEdward Kelly: And then maybe just to follow up quickly. I had some comments around holiday and sort of stretching out holiday. Maybe just a little bit more color on what you're looking to do there. Do you think shopping patterns, consumer-wise and traffic, will actually follow that? Just a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about holiday at this point. \nBrian Cornell: Ed, we do think it's going to be a longer holiday shopping season. We're certainly preparing to start earlier than ever before in the October period. We're going to make some big changes. We announced recently that we'll be closed on Thanksgiving. And we certainly expect it's going to be a different rhythm to the shopping season. Obviously, we're going to put a big premium on ease and convenience, delivering great value, but we'll emphasize safety. And we'll also make sure that our guests knows that those top items and that great value is going to be available throughout the season and give them the option of shopping, obviously, in a well-managed, safe Target store or taking advantage of our same-day fulfillment options to give them the certainty that they can get those great gifts, those great items whenever they want. \n So we think it's going to be an extended holiday shopping season. We think it plays well to our multi-category portfolio and the flexibility of our stores and our convenient same-day offerings. So we'll prepare for a very different holiday season. We'll have to stay nimble. We'll have to adjust. But again, I think the team has demonstrated the flexibility and the adaptability to this new environment, and we expect to continue to build market share and delight our guests throughout the holiday season. \nOperator: The next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Congrats on stellar results. The -- reflecting on your omnichannel business, first, just curious of the cadence of the channel mix. Just interested in seeing if there was an acceleration of in-store taking any moderation of the digital sale as the quarter progressed and economies reopened? \n And then second is, obviously, the same-day services are quite robust. I'm just curious what are some of the learnings that you have over the last few months as it relates to Order Pick Up, Drive Up and Shipt. And how are these businesses, therefore, evolving and improving from these learnings? \nBrian Cornell: So Paul, why don't I start. And I'll go back to our comments during our first quarter call. We certainly saw, literally starting in the middle of April, a resurgence of traffic to our stores, and that certainly continued in the second quarter. I commented earlier today when I was speaking with CNBC that despite the tremendous top line growth of 24.3% and digital growing at almost 200% during the quarter, the real star of our performance was the performance we saw in stores, where our store comps were up 10.9% despite an environment where we've seen unprecedented digital shopping. So we certainly saw that guests returning to stores throughout the second quarter, and that was consistent from May into June and July. And we continue to see guests shop our stores. And I think the investments we've made in safety, the investments we've made in our team, the investments we've been making for years and years, putting capital into remodeling our stores and creating a great shopping environment, that's certainly connecting with the guest during the pandemic. \n So we continue to see very strong store traffic. We saw excellent traffic overall during the quarter, up almost 5%. And John can comment on some of the learnings from our same-day fulfillment. I would tell you, I think the biggest learning is just how adaptable and flexible our teams have been and how quickly they've responded to a surge in something like Drive Up that grew over 700% during the quarter alone. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Paul, I think Brian hit right on. Probably the core learning is the ability of our team to be incredibly agile. And we went in a matter of weeks from normal digital sales to volumes that exceeded Q4 last year for many weeks in a row. So the ability of our teams to do that very quickly where typically, planning for Q4 takes us several months. We have a detailed plan. But the teams understood what we were doing, how they needed to execute, we -- the tools that the store teams have built to help them execute proved very scalable and very efficient. And so our ability to do that was outstanding. \n The other side of that, I would say, again, to point to how well the teams executed while taking care of the guests in store, as Brian pointed out, our NPS scores remained very, very high the entire time. Drive Up growing over 700% and still having an NPS score in excess of 80 is just outstanding work by our teams. \n I think the last thing that had kind of changed our thoughts on the thing we've worried about -- only worried being not quite the right word, but thought about a lot is the stores are busy in Q4 serving guests in store. And so how do we continue to balance that with our fulfillment? And what we've seen over the past 3 months is that's not a problem as long as we give them the right tools, staff the stores appropriately, we can take care of running a 10 comp in the stores and running a 20 comp on digital, both of those together. And so we feel really good about the model we've built and the team has built over the past several years, and I think that's probably the biggest learning over the past 3 months. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Paul, I'd add only one other detail. And I think it's a tribute to John's leadership and the quality of the store and supply chain teams. In Q1, we noted that we had turned off our plans to expand pickup and Drive Up to include fresh and frozen food and beverage products. We've turned that back on. And the team recognized that, that was very important to our guests. It was going to continue to be important as we went into the second half of the year. And despite the unprecedented same-day growth and the demand we've seen for Drive Up and pickup, the team has put that back on the road map, and we're now expanding that across the country. And to me, that just points to the further upside opportunity we have with our same-day services. So again, a big tribute to the team, the leadership they provided to recognize that, that was going to be important to our guests. And as opposed to waiting until 2021, we're going to get that back on our road map and begin to stand up those capabilities in the second half of the year. And I think that's going to be just one more aspect that will be appreciated by our guests when they shop Target in the third and fourth quarter. \nOperator: The next question is from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. \nMatthew McClintock: May I also say congrats to the broader Target team, outstanding execution this quarter and, honestly, all year. \nBrian Cornell: Thank you, Matt. \nMatthew McClintock: John, my question actually is for you. I want to take the supply chain from a different angle. You did talk that you're in discussions with vendors right now. You mentioned that some categories have had some out-of-stocks probably because they're just longer lead time categories. I'm not really sure. But I want to -- given the massive volatility in your sales, as Michael talked about, how are your thoughts changing or evolving towards demand forecasting? And how are you thinking about just sourcing in general from those vendors that maybe have long lead times in manufacturing themselves? \nJohn Mulligan: Well, it's a good question. And I would start in a place where demand forecasting is difficult right now, both for us -- and we import a lot of our goods, as you know, directly and from -- for our vendors who have long lead times as well. I think the thing we're working on with them is, we would call it joint business planning, just being sure we're both aligned and that we've built flexibility and agility into what we want to do. There are ways. You can set up sourcing strategies. We do this where we get an initial set order, and then we have very quick ways we can chase into demand through other avenues if we need to. \n So -- and then the same is true domestically. For our vendors that are continuing to build capacities, who have us on allocation, having conversations with them about what we see in demand and what demand we're leaving on the table because we perhaps don't have the inventory we need. \n So to me, this is mostly about conversations and then agility and being flexible when we see the data coming in because it is moving rapidly. And we know when we -- and we talk about it. When we write down a forecast, the only thing we know is that it is wrong. And so how we adjust to that as we see the data coming in is the most important thing. \nBrian Cornell: And I'd only add if we had Christina or Jill or Steph on the call right now, they would talk to you about the changes we've made in assortment, and in many cases, SKU optimization, learning how to do more with less. And we've partnered closely with some of our key vendors to make sure that we're focused on getting the top-selling items into our store and into our system. And we've made some adjustments in SKU rationalization along the way. So I think out of the pandemic, I think we've learned that we can do a lot more with fewer SKUs in certain categories. We've got to focus on the most important items that are in demand with our guests. So we're continuing to learn along the way, and I think we'll become even more efficient going forward. \nOperator: The next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. \nOliver Chen: Congratulations. Regarding the assortment, it's all been performing so excellently. What do you see as opportunities ahead in the assortment? What are you most focused on in terms of areas that we'll see further innovation? And I would also just love your take on Target Circle and the next step in that program as well as your thoughts around the marketplace model and the -- on the e-commerce platform? \nBrian Cornell: Oliver, you've got quite a few questions in the queue. And I'll start, and I'll certainly let Michael and John also jump in. I think as we think about our strategy from an assortment standpoint, I'll go back to something we've talked about for years now. We're at our best when we're a curator and balancing a curated assortment of our own brands and great national brands. And I think you'll continue to see that focus from Target going forward. And as I think about the work and the great work that our merchants have done, it all comes down to being great curators. And they've done that both with our in-store and our online assortment, and I think that is a huge point of difference for us. It served us well. It allows us to meet the growing demand in the digital channel because those items that we're fulfilling the same day are largely coming out of our core store assortment. So you'll see us focus on being great curators. \n As we think about something like Target Plus, we're also taking a very different approach. We're inviting people in. It's an invitation-only platform. And we want to make sure that even in that environment, we're constantly curating, making sure we're delivering the right extension for our assortment and for our guests. So we'll continue to take a very different path, focused on curation in this environment, both with our physical assortment and digital assortment. And we think that's a hallmark of what makes Target such a unique company, and it really complements our multi-category assortment. \n Oliver, on the Target Circle front, we noted that we now have over 75 million members in Target Circle. And obviously, going forward, it's another opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with the guests, to make sure we're even more relevant in their lives and that we continue to enhance the trust that I think we've gained throughout the pandemic. So we're very excited about the opportunity. And I think about the 10 million new digital guests that we've invited in over the last few months, 75 million and growing Target Circle members, it's just one more way for us to continue to meet the needs and delight the guests who shop Target each and every week. \nOperator: Our last question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: So would you attribute all of the slowdown that you've seen in August to the Back-to-School categories? Or would any of it be attributed to some of the enhanced unemployment benefits going away as well? And the question really gets at the heart of once we get past the back-to-school season, shouldn't you see your sales accelerate? And then I have a follow-up. \nBrian Cornell: Mike, honestly, we're watching it carefully and a lot of conversation around the impact of stimulus, what this means going forward. We certainly hope there's a second round of stimulus for small businesses and American consumers. But as we look at our trends right now, I think it's largely adjustments in some of the Back-to-School categories. But we continue to see strength across our portfolio. We continue to see strength in our stores and our digital channels. We continue to grow market share and see momentum within our business. So we'll watch it carefully. \n Obviously, as Michael and John have stated several times, it's a very challenging environment for us to provide guidance. We've got the pandemic in front of us. We've got uncertainty about Back-to-School, Back-to-College, the state of the economy. We do have an election coming up in November. So lots of different dynamics that we have to try to sort through, and we're putting a premium on being really responsive and really flexible. But it's just hard for us to provide an outlook beyond a couple of weeks at a time. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is that you provided a lot of helpful statistics about how the average unit cost to fulfill an online order is now 30% below last year, yet the -- because the digital growth is so strong, that led to 130 basis points of gross margin pressure. So if we assume that some of the incremental sales that you're generating right now recede when consumers go back to traveling and eating out, and yet consumers have really gravitated to these digital fulfillment options like in-store pickup and Drive Up, and those stick around and that digital penetration remains where it is, should we think that this gross margin pressure of about 100, 130 basis point sticks? Or do you have offsets on the horizon that can reduce that pressure? \nMichael Fiddelke: I can take that one, Michael. I think that the -- well, we don't know exactly what those numbers will look like for the back half of the year, and so I'm not going to attempt to predict those. I think what you see in the first half of the year is the durability of the model overall. And as you've heard us say many times, that growth in digital is way bigger to us than just the sales or profit on that one digital transaction because it deepens our relationship with the guest, and that pays off in spending in aggregate. And I think you can see evidence of how that flows through the durability of the model even in the first half of this year amidst all the volatility. If you would have told me before this year that digital would be up over -- almost 200% on the year, and that we would have had a point or more of pressure in gross margin from category mix, but that our operating income rate would be within 30 basis points of the year prior, I'd have taken that outcome in a heartbeat. And so I think that just shows how if you zoom out from the specifics of just one digital transaction, you get a sense of the durability of the model in total. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Michael, I'll just finish up and perhaps to wrap up the call. Well, I think all of us on the call, and I know our entire Target team is looking forward to the day when the pandemic is behind us, when we're spending time with family and friends, we're traveling again, kids are back in school. One of the things that I think will stick around for us is the consumer who's going to continue to consolidate their purchases, is going to appreciate value, is going to look for a safe shopping environment. And we know digital is going to be critically important. And I think what's going to stick around for us is the growth we've seen in market share, the relationship we've built with the consumer during the pandemic and the growing trust that we've formed with the guest who shops our stores or shops with us online each and every day. \n So we're excited about the future. And I think sitting here with Michael and John, we've never felt better about the prospects for the company. And we've certainly advanced our digital maturity by several years. But I think we've really matured our overall operating capabilities during the pandemic. And I think that's going to provide returns for us for years and years to come. \n So operator, with that, that completes our second quarter call. I really appreciate all of you for joining us today and your continued support. So thank you, and stay well.",

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Yes. Karen, I'd say, the great thing is, is that from a behavior perspective, they behave just like the rest of our guests. When we convert someone to a Drive Up order, historically, we've seen them become more engaged with Target, see 30% more sales. That's exactly what we see with this 10%. \n Probably more encouraging from our perspective is that from a repeat purchase perspective, we've seen that increase. 7-day repeat purchases are higher than we have seen historically. 90-day repeat purchases on digital are higher than we have seen historically.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're sharing second quarter results that are, by virtually any measure, exceptional. But I want to say at the outset that what's most extraordinary of all is the environment in which we generated those results. The incredible resilience of our team, the way they've risen first to the pandemic, then to social trauma touched off in May here in Minneapolis is unlike anything I've seen or I'm likely to see again in my career. And I say in all humility that it has been a huge privilege to work alongside this team in this moment. \n The results we reported this morning are truly unprecedented. On the top line, we delivered second quarter comparable sales growth of 24.3%, the strongest we've ever reported. Equally remarkable on the bottom line, we generated adjusted EPS of $3.38, a new record high and strong enough to offset the significant profit headwind we faced in the first quarter. These results are a testament to our team and their passion for our guests and the increasing trust our guests are placing in our brand. \n Our performance also reflects the meaningful investments we've made in recent years, building a business model that is durable enough to perform in any environment, incorporating flexibility in both our merchandise assortment and the fulfillment options we offer to our guests, while articulating a unified purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. In our last earnings call, we described how our business and operations adapted quickly and seamlessly to rapid changes in consumer behavior. As our guests reacted to the implications of the emerging pandemic, we encountered multiple abrupt changes in shopping patterns throughout the first quarter, both across categories and channels. Near the end of that quarter, we returned to growth in our store sales and once again saw growth in categories like apparel. This improved sense of balance in both channel and category mix continued through the second quarter, and we didn't see the dramatic swings we experienced in the first quarter. \n In terms of channel mix, we saw very healthy growth across the board, with store-originated comparable sales growing 10.9% and digital comp sales up nearly 200%. It's worth pausing to acknowledge that at just under 11%, this store-only comp stacks up as one of the best in our history and yet, it happened at a time when American consumers are adopting digital shopping like never before. \n In addition, as I've mentioned in previous calls, channel numbers don't tell the full story because they don't measure the benefit of our work to position our stores as hubs at the center of our digital fulfillment. When you look beneath the surface of the reported numbers, you find that our stores actually drove more than 90% of our second quarter growth, given that they enabled more than 3/4 of our digital sales and an even higher percentage of our digital growth. Store-based fulfillment is uniquely suited to our business model because of the way it fits within our overall strategy. In particular, it aligns with our merchandising approach, which is based on curation, both in our stores and online assortments. As a result, the majority of our digital demand is driven by items that are already available in our stores, which positions us to efficiently rely on those locations to fulfill the demand. \n Among our store-enabled digital fulfillment options, we continue to see the most rapid growth in our same-day offerings in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt. These services offer speed, reliability, convenience and value to our guests. They are digital capabilities enhanced by human interaction, even though they're contactless. This explains why they generate some of the highest levels of satisfaction of anything we provide. \n Together, our same-day services saw more than 270% comp growth in the second quarter, outpacing overall digital growth. Among these services, we saw the fastest growth in Drive Up, which grew an astonishing 734%. We also saw incredible growth in Target sales fulfilled by Shipt, which were up more than 350%. However, even though we have offered pickup in all of our locations for more than 5 years, in-store pickup sales increased more than 60% in the quarter. \n Across all 5 of our core merchandising categories, we delivered very strong share gains in the quarter, driven by the acceleration in our discretionary businesses, combined with continued strength in our frequency categories. We mentioned in the first quarter that we had already gained a year's worth of market share in the quarter alone. Rather than slowing down, our share gains accelerated in the second quarter, and we gained double the dollars compared with the first quarter, bringing our year-to-date share gains to more than $5 billion. \n Among our discretionary categories, we saw the most dramatic comp acceleration in apparel, which moved from a 20% decline in the first quarter to double-digit growth in the second quarter. Hardlines generated the strongest comp overall at more than 40%. This was the result of an even stronger increase in electronics of more than 70% as guests continue to focus on office equipment, home electronics and gaming. Not surprisingly, our guests heightened focus on staying at home was also evident in our home category, we saw more than 30% growth, with particular strength in decor, domestics and kitchenware. Beauty also saw healthy acceleration, doubling its first quarter growth rate to more than 20% in the second quarter. Our less discretionary Food & Beverage and Essentials categories each saw second quarter comp sales growth of about 20%. For both categories, this was slightly slower than we saw in the first quarter, which was marked by dramatic stock-up shopping as the pandemic emerged. \n At a time when every retailer is facing increased uncertainty and unforeseen challenges, we have chosen to continue investing in our business and particularly in our team. Following hundreds of millions of dollars in team investments in the first quarter, in June, we announced that beginning July 5, we would currently raise our starting wage for U.S. team members to $15 per hour. Additionally, we announced a onetime bonus of $200 to our frontline store and distribution center hourly workers in recognition of their efforts throughout this extraordinary year. \n We also announced free access to virtual doctor visits for all team members through the end of the year, regardless of whether they currently subscribe to a Target health care plan. And we announced additional extensions of our 30-day paid leave for vulnerable team members and free backup care for family members. As I've mentioned before, the return on these team investments may be hard to quantify in a spreadsheet, but I am confident that they have been among the most important investments we've made over the last few years. \n In late May into June, our team had to navigate the challenges presented by the killing of George Floyd and the civil unrest that it sparked nationwide. While we all experienced the heartbreak caused by the murder itself, our initial focus was on the safety of our team. As a result, in areas affected by unrest, we closed locations or reduced operating hours, affecting hundreds of our stores across the country. Most of these stores were able to safely resume normal operations in a matter of a few days, but a handful of locations sustained more significant damage. All but 2 of those stores have already reopened, and we're hoping to have those locations reopened by the end of the year. Through it all, I'm happy and grateful to say that none of our team experienced physical harm through the unrest. \n But beyond physical safety, our team is passionately demanding equity and justice for our black colleagues and guests. We are united in that passion and committed to supporting our team while playing an active role in addressing the persistent racial injustices that have sparked protests around the world. Beyond our team's volunteer efforts across the country, we have dedicated $10 million, half from corporate giving and half from our foundation towards Twin City rapid response needs, local rebuilding efforts and national social justice initiatives. \n We've also formed a committee called REACH, consisting of senior leaders who have come together based on their experience and expertise. Together, they represent a broad enterprise view, and their work is focused on advancing racial equity for our black team members and guests across all areas of Target's business. To deliver the most impact across our business, REACH is aligned around 4 key areas of focus: team, guests, communities and civic engagement and public policy. With their help, we're putting our influence to work in our hometown and in the country, bringing together our team, our neighbors, other businesses and community partners to determine actions and resources that will move us towards a more inclusive, equitable and just society. \n Now let's turn to our plans for the third quarter and beyond. Our research tells us that guests still want to celebrate seasons and holidays even as they acknowledge that things will be different in this new environment. To help our guests adapt to these changes, we're building flexibility into our merchandising and operations to allow our guests to celebrate the season in new ways. Knowing that many parents about the country are still facing uncertainty about whether their children will be attending school in person or virtually, we'll be featuring our Back-to-School assortment for an extended period this year, allowing parents to delay shopping until they have more certainty on their school district plans. \n In Back-to-College markets, we'll be moving in-store shopping events outside into our parking lots and highlighting contactless options like Drive Up. Across the chain, we'll be promoting the wallet feature within the Target app as a fast, contactless alternative to paying with a physical card. And for Halloween, we'll continue to feature costumes and decor to celebrate the season. But we'll be adjusting our candy merchandising in anticipation of a reduction in trick or treating this year. In addition, we'll be giving away surprise boo bags to our Drive Up guests in October, featuring surprises along with tips and suggestions for celebrating the season. Also this fall, we'll roll out the third and final phase of our Good & Gather assortment, adding more than 600 items to bring the total number of items to nearly 2,000. \n The Good & Gather brand is clearly resonating with our guests and delivering on our Food & Beverage vision to enhance the Target experience by making it easy for families to discover the joy of food. We launched this new flagship brand less than a year ago, and it has already generated more than $1 billion in sales. With the momentum from this new brand, our own-brand Food & Beverage business has been growing more than 30% so far this year, significantly outpacing the market and growing market share. \n Beyond Good & Gather, we continue to benefit from an unmatched portfolio of owned and exclusive brands that spans our entire assortment. Together, these brands whose sales have outgrown national brands so far this year, offer guests quality and style at an unmatched value while enhancing Target's differentiation and delivering attractive gross margin rates. \n In June, we launched Casaluna, a collection of more than 700 quality bedding and bath items featuring elevated natural and sustainable materials like linen, hemp, silk, cashmere, all at an amazing value. And of course, it was only in January that we launched our new activewear brand, All in Motion, and the timing couldn't have been better. All in Motion was designed with a commitment to quality, sustainability and inclusivity at incredible Target prices. As guests across the country have moved to working from home, they embraced the quality, comfort and value provided by this new brand, driving sales well beyond our original expectations. \n Also this quarter, Target Circle will be celebrating its 1-year anniversary of its national rollout. At more than 75 million members, Circle has exceeded our expectations in its first year. To celebrate, we'll be highlighting Circle in our marketing with a focus on driving acquisition and engagement in advance of the fourth quarter shopping season. \n And finally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we're focusing first on guests and in team member safety, developing plans to reduce crowds and spread out demand throughout the season. Specifically, we'll be spreading our best-priced holiday offers over a longer time frame, beginning in October, so guests can shop safely and conveniently without worrying about missing out on deals that usually come only late in the season. We've also announced that we'll be closing stores on Thanksgiving, sending a clear signal to guests that they won't need to stand in line and crowd into stores to get a great deal. \n In addition, we'll be making thousands of additional items available via same-day services this holiday season, including more gifts, essentials and everything in between. In addition, as John will describe in more detail, we'll offer fresh and frozen grocery items, via Order Pick Up and Drive Up at more than 1,500 Target stores this fall. \n As I said in the beginning, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the performance they've delivered on behalf of our guests. As we focus on transforming our business over the last few years, we began with a focus on our guests and how we could better serve them by leveraging our strengths. We emerged from that effort with a durable business model, differentiated from our competitors and designed to perform in a variety of environments. \n When we contemplated the range of environments we might face, I don't think anyone could claim that they knew what we'd be facing today. Yet in the face of unprecedented changes in the environment, our business is doing what it's designed to do: It's delivering convenience, reliability, safety and value, driving increased engagement and trust among our guests. It's supporting and rewarding our team, the best team in retail. It's playing a positive role in the communities where we live and work. It's generating strong, sustainable business results in the support of our shareholders and is accomplishing these results by relying on our stores when many others are walking away from their physical locations. \n As we look ahead, we're prepared to navigate through a host of potential challenges, including the ongoing threat from the coronavirus and economic headwinds resulting from high levels of unemployment. Yet, as we said in our last call, we have never been more confident in our differentiated strategy and our long-term potential. Throughout this crisis, we have deepened our relationship with American consumers and introduced millions of them to our digital fulfillment services. As a result, we've seen unprecedented growth in market share, a trend that we expect to continue. \n With a strong business and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to weather any near-term economic headwinds and continue to serve and delight our guests. Our team is ready and eager to seize the opportunity in front of us. \n Now I'll turn the call over to John, who will provide an update on operations and our plans going forward. John? Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to pause and thank everyone on the call today for listening in and for your continued engagement in our business. For those of you who've been on these calls for a while, I think you'd agree it's been quite a journey. In fact, when you look back at our release and remarks from the second quarter 5 years ago, you can quickly see how far we've come. In the second quarter 2015, we reported healthy growth in our earnings per share, with both GAAP and adjusted EPS expanding to just over $1.20 or more than $2 lower than the quarter we just reported. Digital sales grew 30% and accounted for just under 3% of our total sales compared with just over 17% this year. Five years ago, after-tax ROIC expanded 2 full percentage points to 13.3%, nearly 4 percentage points lower than the 17.2% we just reported. \n Among the priorities we covered in this call 5 years ago, becoming a leader in digital, having just introduced our ship-from-store capability, defining our category roles and reasserting our authority in style categories like apparel and home, and ramping up our test of the small-format stores in dense urban areas. Also in the quarter 5 years ago, we sold our pharmacy business to CVS and announced that John Mulligan will become the company's first Chief Operating Officer with a goal of modernizing our supply chain and operations. \n As in every upward journey, our progress over the last 5 years has not been a straight line. Along the way, we reached some plateaus and sometimes even lost some altitude before resuming the climb. That's why it's sometimes helpful to look back over a longer distance to get a true picture of the progress. \n But unlike the ascent of a mountain, our journey will not end up with a climb back down. Success will be defined by further growth with a constant eye on what consumers want and need. To meet those ever changing needs, we'll need to continue to reinvent ourselves, changing our operations along the way. \n Yet, some things will sustain over the longer term, like our culture, values and our team's commitment to one another. These strengths have defined this great company for decades, and our commitment to maintaining them has never been stronger. \n With that, we'll move to Q&A. John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Michael, why don't you start? John, anything else you want to add? And Karen, the only thing I would add is we continue to see the most valuable and profitable guest to Target is the guest that uses all of our channels. And we continue to see stickiness as store guests discovers Drive Up or discovers the benefits of Shipt and also digital guests that are now coming into our stores because of the investments we've made and the trust we're building. So we'll continue to report more about those new guests in quarters to come. But certainly, we're very excited about what that means to our future. Ed, why don't I start. And I commented earlier today that our August comps are off to a very solid start with low to mid-teen growth at this point in the month, and it's been broad-based. So we're continuing to see the kind of performance we saw in the second quarter continue into Q3: strength in food and Essentials, continued strength in electronics, continued to strength in home. And certainly, we've seen some adjustments in categories that are very school related as consumers look for greater certainty around when they're going to start the back-to-school season. But I think, again, the most important indicator right now, as I look at our August performance, is the consistent market share growth that we're seeing across our entire portfolio. \n And each and every week, as we look at IRI and NPD performance, we continue to see a lot of green boxes and continue to pick up market share across the board and across our entire multi-category portfolio. \n Obviously, we're all looking at Back-to-School and Back-to-College trends. And each and every day, there's new information. As we sit here today, and I think the number is there's something close to 56 million students in the K-12 bracket that are waiting to go back to school. And as of this week, it looks like well over 60% will start school remotely. And we'll look for more information. We don't know if those students will be welcomed back into a classroom in September or October. Many may wait actually until January. So we've made the decision to be flexible. And we'll extend the season and extend our assortment because we know at some point in time those students will need backpacks and uniforms. They're going to need school supplies, so we've got to make sure that we continue to flex. And I think it's been the hallmark of our performance throughout the first 2 quarters of this year, our ability to stay agile, stay flexible, meet the needs of the new environment, and we'll continue to take that approach with back-to-school season and with the back-to-college environment as well. Ed, we do think it's going to be a longer holiday shopping season. We're certainly preparing to start earlier than ever before in the October period. We're going to make some big changes. We announced recently that we'll be closed on Thanksgiving. And we certainly expect it's going to be a different rhythm to the shopping season. Obviously, we're going to put a big premium on ease and convenience, delivering great value, but we'll emphasize safety. And we'll also make sure that our guests knows that those top items and that great value is going to be available throughout the season and give them the option of shopping, obviously, in a well-managed, safe Target store or taking advantage of our same-day fulfillment options to give them the certainty that they can get those great gifts, those great items whenever they want. \n So we think it's going to be an extended holiday shopping season. We think it plays well to our multi-category portfolio and the flexibility of our stores and our convenient same-day offerings. So we'll prepare for a very different holiday season. We'll have to stay nimble. We'll have to adjust. But again, I think the team has demonstrated the flexibility and the adaptability to this new environment, and we expect to continue to build market share and delight our guests throughout the holiday season. So Paul, why don't I start. And I'll go back to our comments during our first quarter call. We certainly saw, literally starting in the middle of April, a resurgence of traffic to our stores, and that certainly continued in the second quarter. I commented earlier today when I was speaking with CNBC that despite the tremendous top line growth of 24.3% and digital growing at almost 200% during the quarter, the real star of our performance was the performance we saw in stores, where our store comps were up 10.9% despite an environment where we've seen unprecedented digital shopping. So we certainly saw that guests returning to stores throughout the second quarter, and that was consistent from May into June and July. And we continue to see guests shop our stores. And I think the investments we've made in safety, the investments we've made in our team, the investments we've been making for years and years, putting capital into remodeling our stores and creating a great shopping environment, that's certainly connecting with the guest during the pandemic. \n So we continue to see very strong store traffic. We saw excellent traffic overall during the quarter, up almost 5%. And John can comment on some of the learnings from our same-day fulfillment. I would tell you, I think the biggest learning is just how adaptable and flexible our teams have been and how quickly they've responded to a surge in something like Drive Up that grew over 700% during the quarter alone. Yes. Paul, I'd add only one other detail. And I think it's a tribute to John's leadership and the quality of the store and supply chain teams. In Q1, we noted that we had turned off our plans to expand pickup and Drive Up to include fresh and frozen food and beverage products. We've turned that back on. And the team recognized that, that was very important to our guests. It was going to continue to be important as we went into the second half of the year. And despite the unprecedented same-day growth and the demand we've seen for Drive Up and pickup, the team has put that back on the road map, and we're now expanding that across the country. And to me, that just points to the further upside opportunity we have with our same-day services. So again, a big tribute to the team, the leadership they provided to recognize that, that was going to be important to our guests. And as opposed to waiting until 2021, we're going to get that back on our road map and begin to stand up those capabilities in the second half of the year. And I think that's going to be just one more aspect that will be appreciated by our guests when they shop Target in the third and fourth quarter. Thank you, Matt. And I'd only add if we had Christina or Jill or Steph on the call right now, they would talk to you about the changes we've made in assortment, and in many cases, SKU optimization, learning how to do more with less. And we've partnered closely with some of our key vendors to make sure that we're focused on getting the top-selling items into our store and into our system. And we've made some adjustments in SKU rationalization along the way. So I think out of the pandemic, I think we've learned that we can do a lot more with fewer SKUs in certain categories. We've got to focus on the most important items that are in demand with our guests. So we're continuing to learn along the way, and I think we'll become even more efficient going forward. Oliver, you've got quite a few questions in the queue. And I'll start, and I'll certainly let Michael and John also jump in. I think as we think about our strategy from an assortment standpoint, I'll go back to something we've talked about for years now. We're at our best when we're a curator and balancing a curated assortment of our own brands and great national brands. And I think you'll continue to see that focus from Target going forward. And as I think about the work and the great work that our merchants have done, it all comes down to being great curators. And they've done that both with our in-store and our online assortment, and I think that is a huge point of difference for us. It served us well. It allows us to meet the growing demand in the digital channel because those items that we're fulfilling the same day are largely coming out of our core store assortment. So you'll see us focus on being great curators. \n As we think about something like Target Plus, we're also taking a very different approach. We're inviting people in. It's an invitation-only platform. And we want to make sure that even in that environment, we're constantly curating, making sure we're delivering the right extension for our assortment and for our guests. So we'll continue to take a very different path, focused on curation in this environment, both with our physical assortment and digital assortment. And we think that's a hallmark of what makes Target such a unique company, and it really complements our multi-category assortment. \n Oliver, on the Target Circle front, we noted that we now have over 75 million members in Target Circle. And obviously, going forward, it's another opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with the guests, to make sure we're even more relevant in their lives and that we continue to enhance the trust that I think we've gained throughout the pandemic. So we're very excited about the opportunity. And I think about the 10 million new digital guests that we've invited in over the last few months, 75 million and growing Target Circle members, it's just one more way for us to continue to meet the needs and delight the guests who shop Target each and every week. Mike, honestly, we're watching it carefully and a lot of conversation around the impact of stimulus, what this means going forward. We certainly hope there's a second round of stimulus for small businesses and American consumers. But as we look at our trends right now, I think it's largely adjustments in some of the Back-to-School categories. But we continue to see strength across our portfolio. We continue to see strength in our stores and our digital channels. We continue to grow market share and see momentum within our business. So we'll watch it carefully. \n Obviously, as Michael and John have stated several times, it's a very challenging environment for us to provide guidance. We've got the pandemic in front of us. We've got uncertainty about Back-to-School, Back-to-College, the state of the economy. We do have an election coming up in November. So lots of different dynamics that we have to try to sort through, and we're putting a premium on being really responsive and really flexible. But it's just hard for us to provide an outlook beyond a couple of weeks at a time. Yes. Michael, I'll just finish up and perhaps to wrap up the call. Well, I think all of us on the call, and I know our entire Target team is looking forward to the day when the pandemic is behind us, when we're spending time with family and friends, we're traveling again, kids are back in school. One of the things that I think will stick around for us is the consumer who's going to continue to consolidate their purchases, is going to appreciate value, is going to look for a safe shopping environment. And we know digital is going to be critically important. And I think what's going to stick around for us is the growth we've seen in market share, the relationship we've built with the consumer during the pandemic and the growing trust that we've formed with the guest who shops our stores or shops with us online each and every day. \n So we're excited about the future. And I think sitting here with Michael and John, we've never felt better about the prospects for the company. And we've certainly advanced our digital maturity by several years. But I think we've really matured our overall operating capabilities during the pandemic. And I think that's going to provide returns for us for years and years to come. \n So operator, with that, that completes our second quarter call. I really appreciate all of you for joining us today and your continued support. So thank you, and stay well."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While aspects of our second quarter performance could hardly have looked any more different than the first quarter, many of the themes we covered 3 months ago remain true today. Guests are consolidating trips and increasingly turning to Target as the flexibility of our assortment and fulfillment options make us a convenient one-stop shop. We're continuing to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in paying benefits for our team and in new measures to enhance safety and cleanliness in our stores. We're seeing unprecedented market share gains across our multi-category assortment and in virtually every week. And we're focused on financial strength and flexibility as we look ahead given continued volatility and uncertainty in this environment. \n As Brian mentioned, our second quarter comp sales growth of 24.3% is the highest we've ever reported. Total sales grew 24.8%, reflecting 0.5 point of benefit from new and nonmature stores. Among the drivers of our comp growth, comparable traffic grew 4.6%, while average basket grew 18.8%, reflecting trip consolidation in both our stores and digital channels. \n Across those channels, store-originated comp sales grew 10.9%, meaning stores growth alone matched our total comp sales growth in the first quarter. On top of those store sales, digitally originated comp sales grew 195%, contributing another 13.4 percentage points to our total comp growth. \n Within digital, we continue to see the fastest growth in our same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, which together grew 273% over last year. As John mentioned, these services have much lower unit costs compared with the orders we ship to our guests, helping us to control costs even as our digital sales continue to explode. \n Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.9% was about 30 basis points higher than last year. Among the tailwinds to gross margin, we saw about 180 basis points of rates benefit from core merchandising strategies, which played out most prominently in lower markdown rates compared with last year. \n In addition, we saw about 50 basis points of benefit from the change in the sales return reserve estimate that we held at the beginning of the quarter. Among the headwinds, digital fulfillment and supply chain costs accounted for a rate headwind of about 130 basis points, while category mix drove about 70 basis points of pressure. \n On the SG&A line, the second quarter results included $400 million of investments in team member pay and benefits and measures to protect the health and safety of our guests and team. However, these investments were more than offset by the leveraged benefit of exceptionally strong sales growth. And as John mentioned earlier, the benefits of this leverage extended well beyond strictly fixed costs, leading to an astounding reduction in our SG&A expense rate of about 180 basis points in the quarter. On the depreciation and amortization line, we also saw healthy leverage on a small reduction in dollars, driving about 60 basis points of rate favorability compared with last year. \n Altogether, our second quarter operating margin rate of 10% was about 280 basis points higher than a year ago. This performance was well outside anything I have seen in my 15 years at this company and certainly beyond anything we would have anticipated going into the quarter. However, these results followed a first quarter profit decline that was also well outside of anything I have ever seen or would have anticipated. \n As such, it's useful to look at the 2 quarters together and see how things have played out so far this year. On very strong comp sales growth of nearly 18% in the first half of 2020, our operating margin rate is about 30 basis points lower than last year, reflecting meaningful pressure on the gross margin line, mostly offset by rate improvements on both the SG&A and D&A expense lines. This performance translates to a very healthy operating income dollar growth of 12.6% for the first half of the year, which is a testament to the durability of our model in a very unusual environment. \n On the bottom line, our business generated second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.38 and GAAP EPS of $3.35, both up more than 80% compared to last year. Year-to-date, both of these measures have seen increases in the upper teens, stronger than we anticipated as we entered the year. \n Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment. Many of the themes we outlined in our last earnings call remain the same today. Regarding cash flow, we saw strong second quarter performance on top of a strong first quarter. As a result, through the first half of the year, we've generated cash from operations of about $5.1 billion, which is $2.3 billion higher than last year. The largest driver of this favorability is our inventory leverage, which was well above 100% at the end of the quarter. A portion of this leverage is the natural benefit of rapid sales growth, which increases inventory turnover and enhances payables leverage. However, as I mentioned last quarter, this benefit is exaggerated by our inventory position, which continues to be leaner than we want it to be. Specifically, at the end of the second quarter, our inventory position was 3% lower than a year ago compared with a year-to-date sales increase of more than 18%. Put another way, at the end of the quarter, we'd have preferred to have less cash and more inventory to support the frequency and import categories John highlighted earlier. And we have plans in place to invest in that stronger inventory position in the back half of the year, which will unwind a portion of the favorability you've seen in the front half. \n Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities remain the same as they have been for decades. We first invest fully in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and build on our nearly 50-year history of annual increases. And finally, we return any excess cash beyond these first 2 uses through share repurchases within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Regarding CapEx, we invested $660 million in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to just over $1.4 billion, slightly higher than last year. As John mentioned earlier, following a brief pause in the first quarter, we are back in the business of building and opening new stores, and we're on track to open nearly 30 new locations this year, just short of our original plan. However, given the dynamics of remodel projects, we are maintaining our revised plan to complete about 130 remodels this year, well below last year and our original plan. As a result, we are expecting 2020 CapEx in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, down from our original plan of about $3.5 billion for the year. \n Turning to dividends. We paid a total of $330 million in the second quarter, up from $328 million a year ago. And in June, our Board of Directors approved a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend, keeping us on track to deliver our 49th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. \n We didn't invest any cash in share repurchases in the second quarter following our first quarter announcement that we were suspending repurchases in the current environment. Today, if you looked casually at our current cash position and second quarter results, you might wonder if we were ready to resume share repurchase activity. And the answer to that question is not yet. While second quarter profitability was unexpectedly strong, it was only 90 days ago that we reported a quarterly profit decline of more than 60%, highlighting how volatile the environment has been and may continue to be. Moreover, as we look ahead, there are many potential challenges on the horizon, including uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, economic headwinds from historically high unemployment, uncertainty surrounding government stimulus and a contentious November election. So while we have very strong confidence in our long-term prospects, our ability to continue to expand market share and grow profitably over time, we believe it's the prudent, long-term decision to preserve liquidity in the current environment, giving us the flexibility to safely navigate through any near-term headwinds. \n So finally, I will close this section with a quick comment on our after-tax ROIC, which grew to 17.2% this quarter, up from 15.2% a year ago. Even though we report this metric on a trailing 12-month basis, it has been unusually volatile this year given the dramatic changes in performance we've seen. Specifically, at the end of the first quarter, this metric was nearly 4 percentage points lower than today at 13.4%, driven by the steep profit decline we faced in the first quarter. So while this metric may continue to move around during this period of heightened volatility, we will remain focused on making the right long-term investments in our business, allowing us to deliver higher after-tax returns over time. \n Now I want to turn briefly to our outlook. And consistent with last quarter, I won't be providing any precise guidance. However, I want to reinforce what I was just saying earlier, which is that we are moving through a period of unusually high uncertainty and volatility. And while John was correct that we felt a much stronger sense of normalcy in the second quarter, volatility continued to be elevated. Specifically within the second quarter, May was by far the strongest month with a 33% comp, followed by June at 21%, and July at about 20%. And so far in August, due largely to softer sales in our Back-to-School categories, month-to-date comp sales have been running in the low double digits. \n Now let me be clear, a double-digit increase is still quite strong in the context of history, but a 20 percentage point spread between our May and August to date comps is an incredibly wide swing within a few months, highlighting the difficulty of forecasting our business right now. So given that our Q1 performance was not a good predictor of our second quarter results, our Q2 results should not be viewed as a predictor of our performance going forward. And given that we can't eliminate uncertainty in the environment, we continue to place a premium on flexibility in our plans. This will allow us to quickly pivot when we see changes in our business, as you've seen us do successfully multiple times this year. \n So now I want to conclude my remarks in the same way I did 90 days ago by saying that a single quarter's financial results are not the basis for our long-term confidence. That confidence springs from the fact that we continue to focus on investing for the long term because Target's long-term prospects have never been brighter. We have a durable business model with flexibility in both our merchandising assortment and the fulfillment options we offer. We're building on an already deep relationship with our guests as they trust us like never before to conveniently and safely fulfill their wants and needs. And with a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow, we have the capacity to navigate any near-term challenges and play offense, just like we have over the last few years. \n But most importantly, we have an amazing team across our stores, headquarters, distribution facilities and offices around the world. We have all rallied around a common purpose: to serve our guests, serve our communities, fight for racial equity and to support each other. All of us who work here know how special the team is. So I want to thank our entire team for all they are doing in this exceptional time and for making Target special, truly a company like no other. \n Now I'll turn it over to Brian for some final remarks. Sure, Karen. And maybe I'll start by saying, I empathize with those of you on this call trying to extract trends from our Q1 and Q2 margin rates. You can see the underlying volatility of the business if you pick apart those trends in Q1 and Q2. To focus for a second on where we've been, I actually think it's useful to zoom out and look at the year-to-date trends. If you unpack margin on a year-to-date basis, we've got just over 1 point of pressure from the accelerated growth in digital and supply chain investments and have just over 1 point of pressure in category mix. And you've got a wide variety of movement across the markdown front: some of the markdowns we took in Q1 were lower and then the benefit of more sales at reg price in Q2. And an example of that, Karen, is really, if you think about how -- the sell-through we're getting given our strong sales, we're taking a lot less product to clearance at the end of the season than we would typically. And so that's an example of one of those drivers of favorability that contributes to the 180 basis points of good news in Q2. \n Those will be key levers as we look ahead going forward. But like we said before, predicting them is an exercise in imprecision at this point. I can take that one, Michael. I think that the -- well, we don't know exactly what those numbers will look like for the back half of the year, and so I'm not going to attempt to predict those. I think what you see in the first half of the year is the durability of the model overall. And as you've heard us say many times, that growth in digital is way bigger to us than just the sales or profit on that one digital transaction because it deepens our relationship with the guest, and that pays off in spending in aggregate. And I think you can see evidence of how that flows through the durability of the model even in the first half of this year amidst all the volatility. If you would have told me before this year that digital would be up over -- almost 200% on the year, and that we would have had a point or more of pressure in gross margin from category mix, but that our operating income rate would be within 30 basis points of the year prior, I'd have taken that outcome in a heartbeat. And so I think that just shows how if you zoom out from the specifics of just one digital transaction, you get a sense of the durability of the model in total."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 20, 2020. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. \n In a few moments, Brian, John and Michael will provide their perspective on the first quarter and our continued focus on our guests and our team as we navigate through the current environment. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K and the 8-K we furnished this morning. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the first quarter and the short-term and longer-term implications for our business. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate that you've joined us on this morning's call, and we hope that you, your family and friends are safe and healthy. It goes without saying but this quarter was unlike anything we've seen in our company's long history. And while we didn't establish another all-time record for this quarter's EPS, I have never been more proud of our performance. \n Over the last few years, we built a strategy and operating model that's designed to generate strong performance in a wide variety of environments, and the first quarter demonstrated the strength of that model. Unprecedented volatility within the quarter presented the most extreme test of our business and operations that I could have imagined, and in that environment, we drove industry-leading growth with a total comp sales increase of 10.8% and digital comp growth of more than 140%. \n As I reflect on all that's transpired since the quarter began in February, there were 2 key factors in our success: our strategy of positioning stores and fulfillment hubs and our unbelievable team. When guests began flocking to our stores to stock up, our team was ready. And when digital demand exploded as guests began to shelter in place, our teams have the tools, processes and capability to flex to meet that shift in demand. \n But it goes well beyond processes and tools because our team's efforts on behalf of our guests and communities have been monumental. The pride our team has shown and their willingness and ability to deliver essential products and services to our guests is humbling and inspiring. Our guests are putting their trust in Target. The team is delivering, and they deserve our enduring gratitude. \n At our financial community meeting at the beginning of March, we highlighted multiple dimensions of flexibility built into our operating model. We offer a balanced merchandising assortment that is unique in retail, allowing Target to serve our guests' rapidly evolving demands for wants and needs. We have a unique digital strategy based on a curated assortment of the categories and items that our guests expect from us. We deliver this digital assortment through a comprehensive suite of fulfillment options, including our rapidly growing same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive-Up and Shipt. \n In support of our digital strategy, we place our stores at the center of fulfillment, which gives us both speed and efficiency. This structure also allows our teams to pivot seamlessly when our guests' channel preferences change. We have teams at headquarters, stores and throughout the supply chain who are relentlessly focused on our guests and who place a premium on agility and adaptability. And with a strong balance sheet and a business model that generates robust cash flow, we have the financial flexibility to handle difficult times like this, allowing us to fund investments in the safety of our guests and our team while serving a critical role in communities as a trusted essential retailer. \n Given our unique assortment and comprehensive suite of fulfillment options, we could see firsthand as our guests' mindset rapidly evolved during the first quarter. While it already feels like years ago, during the first 3 weeks of February, we experienced a relatively normal mix of sales across merchandising assortment and a typical mix of sales between our stores and digital channels. Towards the end of February, we saw an acceleration in traffic and sales, particularly in our stores. However, we continue to see a lot of cross-shopping in the more discretionary categories when the guests made trips to stock up on food and essentials. \n Around the middle of March, the mix of guests' purchases became much more nearly focused on food, beverages and household essentials, and we began seeing much softer trends in discretionary categories, most notably in apparel. In addition, as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, guests began to pull back on store trips, and we saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales. We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware in our home assortment. \n And finally, around the middle of April, we experienced a rapid increase in traffic and sales in our stores and a broad surge in sales of more discretionary categories, including apparel, which persisted throughout the end of the month. The surge in stores occurred while our digital growth continued at unprecedented rates of 200% to 300% above last year. As a result, over the last couple of weeks of April, we saw some of the strongest comparable sales growth we've experienced in our history. When you put all these chapters together and look at the first quarter in total, our comparable sales grew nearly 11% with a wide range of performance across categories as guests changed their shopping pattern in response to the crisis. \n Among our 5 core merchandising categories, we saw the strongest performance in Hardlines, which grew comparable sales by well over 20%. Growth was particularly strong in electronics where comps grew more than 45%, reflecting high demand for video games and home office items. Essentials & Beauty saw high-teen comp growth while comps in Food and Beverage grew by more than 20% as guests trusted Target for both their stock-up trips and their everyday needs. \n In Home, we saw high single-digit comp growth, led by kitchen, which saw comp growth in excess of 25%. And in apparel, first quarter comparable sales declined about 20%, reflecting soft sales in late March into early April, followed by a resumption of growth in the last 2 weeks of April. As we evaluate these category trends relative to overall U.S. retail and on a category-by-category basis, we are seeing unprecedented share gains across every measure. \n Clearly, in portions of our business, share statistics reflect the fact that nonessential retailers across the country have remained largely closed. And even though we compete with them, we sincerely look forward to the day when our retail colleagues can reopen. After all, a healthy retail sector is critical to the overall health of the U.S. economy. And of course, employees of our competitors often shop at Target, too. \n More fundamentally, we believe recent share numbers reflect the trust that our guests have placed in our stores, our digital capabilities, our team and our brand. In particular, as our teams have risen to meet our guests' needs and deliver friendly, reliable service during this unprecedented time, we believe that our guests' level of trust has only become deeper throughout this crisis. \n From a channel perspective, first quarter store sales grew about 1% while digital comp sales increased by 141%. Of course, these quarterly numbers mask how quickly trends changed within the quarter. Specifically, we began the quarter with a relatively normal February, in which we saw overall comp growth of 3.8% and digital comp growth of 33%, and ended in April which saw total company comp growth of more than 16% and a jaw-dropping 282% increase in digital comp sales. \n I want to pause and comment on that April digital performance for a moment because I suspect that many of you might have wondered whether our operations could sustain such a strong increase for an entire month. After all, to put this volume into perspective, on an average day in April, our operations were fulfilling many more items and orders than last year's Cyber Monday, a day for which we had planned months ahead of time. In contrast, this unprecedented surge in volume was completely unexpected at the beginning of the quarter, and it ramped up from normal trends in a matter of weeks. \n And by design, it was our stores that enabled this surge in digital volume, fulfilling more than 80% of our digital sales in April. Even more impressive, within our April digital sales growth of just over $1.1 billion compared with last year, store fulfillment accounted for more than $950 million of that growth as both our same-day services and shipments to guests' homes saw significant increases. \n How is this accomplished? John will provide more details in a few minutes, but I'd reiterate that it comes down to 2 factors: our strategy of using our stores as hubs and the ability of our team to quickly pivot to meet shifting demand. And while we incurred extra costs to accommodate this incredible surge in digital fulfillment, we expect to gain a long-term benefit in terms of guest loyalty. \n During the first quarter, more than 5 million guests shopped on Target.com for the first time, with more than 2 million of those guests making their first Drive-Up trip. And because of the amazing flexibility of our team, we saw consistently strong levels of satisfaction with the Target.com shopping experience even in the face of crushing increase in demand. \n So now I want to turn to our focus going forward, which isn't going to change. We continue to focus on serving our guests while taking steps to provide for their safety. And we'll continue to focus on our teams, investing in their safety and their well-being while working to remove obstacles and allow them to serve guests during this critical time. \n Throughout this evolving crisis, we have continually adapted our operations and processes to enhance guest and team member safety. Looking ahead, we'll continue to quickly adapt to changes in the environment and emerging guidance from the CDC and other authorities. Already during the first quarter, we took numerous steps to protect our guests, Shipt shoppers and our team members, including enhanced cleaning standards, providing personal protective equipment to our team members and Shipt shoppers, installing plexiglass dividers at checkout and implementing metering protocols in our stores where appropriate. For our team, we rolled out a wellness checklist for them to perform before each Shipt and provided free thermometers to team members who needed them. \n We also invested hundreds of million dollars in extra pay and benefits for our team, adding $2 to their hourly wage, investing in enhanced backup daycare options across the country and offering enhanced paid leave for team members with vulnerable health conditions. Consistent with our long-standing commitment to the communities where we live and work, we donated personal protective equipment to over 50 health care organizations and shared tools and expertise with government partners and other businesses to help protect health care workers and assist other businesses in reopening and operating safely. \n In addition, we recently announced our foundation's biggest single donation in company history, $10 million, to assist team members, communities, national organizations and the global response to this pandemic. Beyond our corporate commitment, thousands of team members are volunteering in their local communities, including a group of 3D-printing enthusiasts on our technology team who are using their personal devices to produce and donate plastic face shields to local hospitals. \n And most recently, just this week, we announced the extension of higher pay and enhanced benefits for our team through the end of June. We initially announced these temporary changes to the end of April, and last month, we announced we were extending them through May. And today, even as the country is starting to talk about how things will look when we get back to normal, our teams continue to face unprecedented challenges as they serve families and their communities. As a result, we're proud to support our amazing team members as they navigate through these challenging times. \n In terms of our financial expectations, Michael will offer his perspective in a few minutes, but we're maintaining our recent suspension of financial guidance. From today's perspective, the one thing that seems most certain is continued volatility, and whenever possible, we're building flexibility into our plans and commitments. But let me be clear, the expectation of continued volatility in the external environment doesn't translate to a lack of confidence about our future. \n If there's one thing our team and operators have demonstrated, it's the ability to adapt to rapid change and continuing delivering outstanding service for our guests. And as I said before, it's at times like these that we can all see the benefit of a strong balance sheet and fundamentally sound business model. The financial strength gives us the flexibility to focus on what matters most, our guests and our team, giving us confidence that we'll emerge from this crisis as a stronger, more relevant retailer with an even higher level of affinity and trust among our guests. \n So as I turn the call over to John, I want to once again offer my thanks to the entire Target team, from headquarters to our operations and offices around the world. I've never been part of a stronger team, and I share your pride in the essential role that Target is playing in the lives of our guests. \n Thank you for your inspiring efforts every day. John? \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Brian. On these calls over the last few years, I've described our long-term journey in operations to completely transform our supply chain and fulfillment infrastructure, moving from our prior linear model based exclusively on store shopping to a unique modern structure designed to support a broad array of fulfillment choices; to position our stores as the hub for guest fulfillment, whether a guest trip is based on traditional shopping, use of one of our same-day services or delivering a package to their front door; to invest in technology, data and analytics to increase our inventory accuracy and better forecast demand throughout the network, leading to improved in-stocks, higher guest satisfaction and ultimately, stronger sales; to transform how we select and build store sites, moving from a rigid, large-format prototype model to a model in which we focus first on the neighborhood we want to serve, design a store to fit within the available space and then curate a merchandise assortment to fit that particular neighborhood; and finally, to transform our store team, moving from a model based on general athletes to one in which different parts of the team have accountability for individual businesses, supported by tools and processes that allow them to make decisions in real time and focus on serving our guests in new ways. One goal of all these changes was to make our operations and our team far more nimble and agile in support of our guests. And while the journey is far from over, this quarter demonstrated the benefits of everything we have already accomplished. \n As Brian already described, over the course of the first quarter, our team had to pivot dramatically and rapidly in response to multiple changes in shopping behavior: comps in essentials and Food and Beverage moving from single digits in February to peaks above 50% in March before settling down into the teens in April; apparel trends moving just as rapidly in the other direction, from positive single digits at the beginning of the quarter to trough declines of more than 50% beginning in late March, before resuming growth in the last half of April. With this volatility in category sales, managing our inventory has also presented a significant challenge. In apparel, given the recent dramatic slowdown in sales, teams have been working closely with vendors to make appropriate changes based on our current inventory and future purchases. \n Across the remainder of our core merchandising categories, we've seen a dramatic increase in the pace of sales causing out-of-stocks to rise well above where we'd like them to be. In need-based categories like Food and Beverage and essentials where comps have accelerated into the 20% range, we have been on allocation from multiple vendors as they work to ramp up production to cover the higher level of demand. Among some categories like paper, in-stocks have been recovering in recent weeks. But across many portions of both essentials and Food and Beverage, we continue to sell out quickly when we receive shipments of products from our vendors. In other categories like Home and electronics, we have been increasing order quantities to match the higher pace of sales. However, given that many of these categories are primarily imported, we will likely see some persistent out-of-stocks until we can receive replenishment inventory from these overseas producers. \n Beyond categories, the volatility in shopping channels has been just as extreme, store comps moving from positive numbers to double-digit declines in late March and early April, then back to growth towards the end of April; digital comps moving from around 30% in February to nearly 10x that pace in April. Through all of these extremes, the team maintained a positive attitude and demonstrated their pride in the positive role that they're playing in our guests' lives. I am humbled and inspired by what they've been able to deliver on behalf of our guests. The ability of our team and our network to attain and sustain digital comps of nearly 300% for the entire month of April has been incredible to watch. \n There are too many stats to share, but I'll tick through a few because I think they're helpful in understanding how remarkable it's been. Multiple measures of unit volume, including ship-from-store, Target orders fulfilled by Shipt and overall digital, were higher in the first quarter of 2020 than in the first 3 quarters of 2019 combined. Units provided through Drive-Up in the first quarter were higher than in all of 2019. Sales of orders shipped from stores or picked up in stores increased nearly 150% in the first quarter. Target sales fulfilled by Shipt were up more than 300%, and sales through Drive-Up were up more than 600% higher than a year ago. \n In April, sales on Drive-Up increased nearly 1,000% compared with a year ago. These growth numbers reflect the fact that Drive-Up continues to be our most popular service and the number of guests who are trying and repeatedly using Drive-Up continues to increase rapidly. Specifically, more than 5 million guests used our Drive-Up service in the first quarter, with 40% of these guests new to the service. And amazingly, despite this unexpected explosion in first quarter digital volume, the team continues to execute with amazing speed. Both the percent of orders shipped from store on time and the percent of pickup and Drive-Up orders picked on time was approximately 95% in the quarter, and both measures were higher than the first quarter a year ago. \n One thing we've observed about this crisis is that it is causing an acceleration in consumer trial and adoption of digital shopping. The ability of our operations to handle this unexpected acceleration has given us even stronger conviction that we have the right model and we have ample capacity to handle continued change in the future. Specifically, as part of our long-range plans at the beginning of 2020, our first quarter digital volumes weren't anticipated for another 3 years, but our operations accommodated that extra volume without any advanced planning. Like Brian said, it was an extreme test of our model and our team, and both performed admirably in the face of the challenge. \n Another area in which the crisis has accelerated existing trends relates to the amount of retail square footage in the U.S. We have long understood that the U.S. market is over-stored, and we've all observed the rationalization of unproductive retail space in recent years. But let me quickly say we continue to strongly believe that the future of U.S. retail will be based on an omnichannel model, in which quality retailers will serve their customers through both physical and digital capabilities. That's why we've consistently pursued a strategy based on investments to enhance both physical and digital shopping. \n And while we have temporarily slowed down our plans for remodels and new stores because of the crisis, that doesn't mean we have less enthusiasm for these projects. Rather, we slowed down our plans for 2 specific reasons. First, we wanted to remove obstacles and distractions facing our team so they could focus exclusively on day-to-day execution in the face of extreme volatility across multiple dimensions of our business. And second, we adjusted our plans in anticipation of construction process changes needed to accommodate social distancing and other measures, which we expect to slow down time lines in some cases. In addition, we expect that more time will be required for inspections and permitting related to these projects given the incremental demands facing local governments in light of this crisis. \n So while it is too soon to lay out longer-term time lines for our remodel and new store programs, we look forward to resuming these projects when appropriate. This will allow us to continue to transform our real estate footprint, both through modernization of existing space and the selective addition of productive new small-format locations located in neighborhoods that couldn't be served when we only opened larger stores. \n A strategic initiative that we temporarily paused during the first quarter was integration of fresh, refrigerated and frozen items into our pickup and Drive-Up capabilities. While we are eager to add this capability and we know our guests want the option, we decided not to add the distraction of implementing this test during the period of peak volatility. However, we recently resumed the test in the Twin Cities market, where it had already begun last year, and we've just expanded the test into the Kansas City market. Operational results have been positive so far. And while we will continue to govern the pace of the rollout based on the circumstances facing our team, we are committed to rolling out this capability to as many stores as possible this year. \n Another exciting strategic development was our recent acquisition of local route optimization technology from Deliv. Following encouraging results of recent tests of this new capability, we elected to purchase the technology and hired members of their team to assist with the integration into our existing systems and processes. We are excited about this new technology because it offers the opportunity to add capacity to our fulfillment network while also reducing the cost of last-mile delivery. And given that last mile is the biggest cost driver within digital, the opportunity to control those costs will play an important role in our operating margins over time. \n With the benefit of this new technology, we can begin testing the addition of sort centers, downstream of our stores within our fulfillment network. These centers, which we expect to be smaller than our average store, will be placed downstream in select markets in which we have a high density of packages being sent to guests' homes. By eliminating the need to sort packages in the individual stores, the throughput of packages from these locations would naturally increase, and we can achieve lower average shipping costs through the scale and route optimization that these downstream centers will provide. \n Given that we only recently acquired this new technology, we don't yet have a time line for this test. What I can say today is that we are planning to test the first of these centers in the Minneapolis market and that we plan to follow our normal discipline of testing and iterating before we decide to scale up. \n So now as I get ready to hand the call over to Michael, I want to end where I started and give a special thanks to our store, distribution and fulfillment center teams. Our society has long recognized the sacrifice of essential workers in the health care industry and public service like police officers and firefighters, but what's been remarkable on this crisis is to see how it has helped people to realize there's a huge army of essential team members at Target and many other retailers who make sure that parents can get food for their family and the essentials they need to manage their health and their household. I've long appreciated the work of these teams since I've been lucky to work alongside them for more than 2 decades, but now with our efforts in the spotlight, I could not be more proud to see their significant contributions recognized. \n Thank you to every one on our team for your hard work and sincere desire to serve all of the families that place their trust in Target every day. Michael? \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. As you've already heard several times today, this quarter was far different than anyone would have modeled 90 days ago across multiple dimensions of our business. And like everyone else, for the last few months, our team has been deeply involved in the details, helping our business to effectively respond to the rapid changes in both our category and channel performance. \n But when you pull back from all the detail and day-to-day volatility, a couple of themes have clearly emerged. First, this environment has provided an accelerated real-time test of the investments we've been making in our longer-term strategy and operational model. And our business has performed better under these conditions than we would have ever imagined. \n Second and also important, this environment provides a vivid illustration of why quarterly profitability isn't always the best indicator of long-term potential. If you only looked at our first quarter EPS, which was down more than 60% compared with last year, you might be tempted to say that our performance was disappointing and that our long-term prospects have been getting weaker, but I'd strongly assert the opposite. Because of what our team has been able to accomplish and deliver for our guests, I believe our long-term prospects have gotten stronger over the last 90 days. Put another way, I wouldn't trade Target's future prospects for anyone else's in the marketplace. \n With that context, I will run through our financial results, providing our longer-term perspective before I turn the call back over to Brian. Overall, our first quarter comparable sales grew 10.8%, reflecting some of the strongest growth our business has ever seen. Total sales grew 11.3%, about 50 basis points faster due to sales from our nonmature stores. Among the drivers of our comp growth, comparable traffic was down 1.5% and average ticket was up 12.5% as guests consolidated their shopping trips into fewer bigger baskets. Among channels, store comparable sales increased 0.9% while digital comp sales grew 141%. As Brian and John highlighted earlier, quarterly averages for category and channel growth don't show the volatility we saw throughout the quarter. \n On the gross margin line, our business delivered a rate of 25.1%, down about 450 basis points from a year ago. Obviously, this is well below what you would expect in normal times, but these times have been anything but normal. There are 3 major drivers of this quarter's decline. First, we incurred hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental costs, including inventory impairments resulting from the severe slowdown in apparel sales. For context on these costs, it's important to note that prior to the first quarter, comp sales in Apparel & Accessories had been growing more than 5% but quickly decelerated to more than a 20% decline in the first quarter. Put another way, if those prior trends in Apparel & Accessories had continued, first quarter sales in that category would have been more than $800 million higher. \n A second source of pressure was category sales mix as we saw wide divergence in sales trends across our business. Our 3 lowest-margin categories, Hardlines, essentials and Food and Beverage, each saw first quarter comp increases in the high teens or higher. In contrast, our 2 highest-margin categories, Home and apparel, saw slower trends with Home in the high single digits and the Apparel decline of more than 20%. Altogether, category sales mix accounted for more than 150 basis points of this quarter's gross margin decline. \n The third major factor was digital fulfillment and supply chain costs as digital penetration more than doubled compared with last year, driving nearly 10 percentage points of our sales growth. As John mentioned earlier, we were already planning to reach this level of digital sales penetration over time, but this crisis has rapidly increased the pace of digital adoption among U.S. consumers. But importantly, given the outstanding performance of our team and operations in the face of this unprecedented surge in volume, we've continued to see high levels of guest satisfaction with our digital fulfillment, which is a positive leading indicator of guest loyalty, engagement and market share over time. \n Moving down to the SG&A expense line. Our first quarter rate was 20.7%, about 10 basis points lower than a year ago. As always, expense performance was driven by many factors, but there were 2 primary drivers of our year-over-year performance. The first was the incremental costs we've incurred as we responded to the crisis, including higher pay for hourly team members in our stores, extended paid leave and backup daycare provisions across our team and enhanced cleaning routines and other investments to protect the health of our guests and our team across the country. Against these higher costs, we realized a meaningful rate benefit from sales leverage given our unusually strong comparable sales growth in the quarter. \n On the D&A line, first quarter dollars were approximately flat to last year, resulting in about 40 basis points of rate improvement on higher sales. Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate of 2.4% was about 400 basis points lower than last year. On the interest expense line, we saw a slight decline in dollars, reflecting the benefit of lower average floating benchmark interest rates. Income tax expense declined about 80% compared with last year, driven primarily by the decline in our profitability. \n On the adjusted EPS line, we earned $0.59 in the first quarter, more than 60% lower than last year. GAAP EPS was about $0.03 lower at $0.56, reflecting the loss on our investments in Casper Sleep. \n Now I want to turn to cash flow and capital deployment. But first, I want to outline a number of actions we've taken this quarter in response to the environment. The first change, as John already outlined, was a reduction in the number of remodels and new stores we are planning for 2020. John already made it clear that this decision was based on removing distractions for our team, combined with the impact of other factors in the external environment. Like John, I want to emphasize that we haven't changed our view of the ultimate long-term value of these projects nor was the decision to slow down these projects driven by the desire to preserve capital. \n Regardless, this change in our plans will affect our anticipated CapEx for the year. At this point, we expect that our 2020 CapEx will be $3 billion or lower in contrast to our prior expectation of about $3.5 billion. At this point, things are too uncertain to provide a view of our plans for future year remodels, new stores and overall CapEx, but we expect to provide more clarity over time. \n The second change occurred in March when we announced the suspension of our share repurchase program in light of the high level of uncertainty in the current environment. This decision was prudent and consistent with our long-term capital deployment priorities in which share repurchase only occurs when we have excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings after we fully invested in our business and supported our dividend. \n And finally, during the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in new debt and added another $900 million revolving credit facility to supplement our existing $2.5 billion revolver. We took these actions out of an abundance of caution given the high degree of uncertainty in the environment and the possibility of a very challenging external environment throughout this year. As we've pointed out many times, we entered this crisis in a very strong position with ample cash on our balance sheet, strong credit ratings and a business model position to generate robust cash flow across a wide range of conditions. Given that strength, our modeling indicated we have a very wide range of potential economic scenarios in which we'd have sufficient liquidity even without the extra capacity resulting from these actions. Even so, given that we were able to issue new debt at historically low rates, we view these decisions as prudent, affordable insurance, giving us an extra layer of cushion to accommodate even more extreme downside scenarios should they arise. \n Turning to cash flow. We actually saw really strong performance in the first quarter as operating cash flow grew nearly $1 billion compared with last year. This performance reflected a number of factors, including an increase in payables and a decrease in inventory compared with last year, along with various timing issues, which more than offset the decline in earnings we experienced this year. \n Regarding our inventory position, while the year-over-year decline looks good on the cash flow statement, it reflects the lack of availability and elevated out-of-stocks we're seeing in multiple categories. As such, we have elected to invest more cash and ended the quarter with a higher level of inventory in those categories if it had been available. \n In terms of deployment of cash, our first quarter CapEx was about $750 million, nearly $100 million higher than last year. In addition, we paid dividends of $332 million to our shareholders and returned another $609 million through share repurchases prior to the suspension of the program in March. \n And finally, on the ROIC line, our business delivered a trailing 12-month after-tax return of 13.4% in the first quarter, down from 14.3% a year ago. Obviously, this decline reflects the dramatic decline in our profitability during the quarter, which does not reflect where we expect our business to perform over time. However, I will quickly add that even though this performance is down from a year ago, a 13.4% after-tax return is still quite strong on an absolute basis and favorable compared to results across a wide array of companies in retail and beyond. \n So now I want to leave you with a couple of important thoughts. First, our long-term priorities for capital deployment have not wavered. At the top of the list is our goal to invest fully in all projects that support our long-term strategic and financial goals. Second, we support the dividend with a goal to build on our long-term record in which we've paid a dividend every quarter in our history as a public company. And finally, over time, we expect to return any excess cash beyond those first 2 uses through share repurchases within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. These capital deployment priorities have served the long-term interest of both our business and our shareholders over many decades. It is our investments in our stores, in our fulfillment capabilities, in our assortment and in our team that have positioned us to succeed now and will power our future. \n The other important point pertains to the resilience of our business combined with the strength of our balance sheet. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I believe that our long-term prospects have only gotten stronger as our operations and team have reliably served guests during this crisis. Because of our multi-category portfolio, we were able to quickly pivot as guest demand evolved from stocking up on food and essentials to focusing on home and electronics as they sheltered in place until we saw a broad-based acceleration across multiple categories toward the end of the quarter. Because of our curated digital assortment and store-based fulfillment model, our operations and team adjusted seamlessly as guests increasingly chose digital fulfillment, allowing digital sales to account for nearly 10 percentage points of our first quarter comparable sales growth. And because of the strength of our business, we could afford to make hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental investments in team member wages and benefits, along with actions to enhance the safety of both our guests and our team. \n As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to deliver for our guests and our team throughout the crisis while preparing to emerge strong and ready to play offense when our economy recovers. And we think the opportunities when that happens will be compelling. Unfortunately, this crisis will cause a lot of dislocation in multiple parts of the economy, including retail. As a result, we expect to have many potential opportunities to invest, including possibilities in real estate, brands, capabilities and obviously, in our existing strategic initiatives. So while we always monitor our short-term financial results and focus on strong execution, I think it's more important than ever for us to maintain a laser focus on the long term when I expect we could have unprecedented opportunities to create value for all of our stakeholders. \n Now like Brian and John, I want to pause and thank everyone on the team for their endless energy, alignment with our values and for taking care of each other. It's said that you don't really know how strong your team is until it goes through challenging times, and I couldn't be more proud to see how our team has risen to the challenge by serving our guests and our communities over the past few months. \n Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to close by reiterating some of the points we shared today. I want to start with something Michael said earlier. \n These times are anything but normal. Guests are facing unprecedented changes in the way they're living and the way they're working. In a matter of weeks, the economy has moved from historically low levels of unemployment to some of the highest ever recorded. Not surprisingly, consumer shopping patterns have been changing significantly and frequently as everyone tries to navigate through these changes. And so things that we might have once taken for granted have suddenly become front and center in our minds. We have renewed appreciation for the things we need in our homes every day, items like food, paper goods and cleaning products that are now more important than ever as we shelter in place and work remotely. In addition, we have a renewed appreciation for the people that make sure we have those products, including the people who produce them, the supply chains that move them and the teams that provide them in stores and bring them to our homes. \n The crisis has clearly demonstrated the essential role of our team members as they offer compassionate, friendly service and do everything possible to ensure that their neighbors have what they need. Like John said, it's humbling and inspiring to work alongside our team and feel their passion and resolve as they persevere through this crisis. They're the heart and soul of Target and the reason I'm so confident in our future. \n With that, we'll move to Q&A. John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly. \nEdward Kelly: Congratulations on strong execution in obviously challenging environment. Brian, I want to -- just want to start with comps. So you obviously saw a significant acceleration in the back half of April. What are you seeing so far in Q2? Any category color here would be helpful. \n What do you think drove this acceleration? Is it just stimulus? And what does it tell us at all about how to think about Q2 comps overall at this point? \nBrian Cornell: Ed, thanks for joining us. We certainly saw an uptick, as we reported, starting on April 15 as stimulus checks arrived across America. And as we reported, we saw a return of a guest who was shopping in our stores but continuing to use our digital fulfillment channels. And we started to see normalization across all of our categories, an uptick again in categories like apparel and Home, but continued strength in our entire portfolio. \n And that's continued through the balance of April. That stabilization, normalization of category shopping has continued in May as we continue to see an uptick in digital fulfillment. So while we're not providing guidance today, we certainly are seeing a more normalized shopping environment both in our stores and online and a guest who's shopping all of our categories, including those discretionary categories like Home and apparel. \nEdward Kelly: Maybe just one follow-up to that. In terms of where you have stores in states that have begun to reopen, how has performance of these stores compared to states where restrictions are still high? I'm just kind of curious as to what you're learning there and how we should be thinking about the business once a broader reopening trend really emerges. \nBrian Cornell: Ed, we're watching it carefully. It's still very early, but I think what we're seeing throughout these last few weeks is the trust that we've earned with American consumers who continue to turn to Target for those household essentials, their food and beverage and now apparel and home items as well as the strength we've seen in Hardlines throughout the quarter. As Americans still work from home and educate their families at home, we provide essential services throughout the pandemic, and we're seeing that continue as states open up across the country. \nOperator: The next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So a couple of financial questions. The first one is can you talk more quantitatively about the gross margin drivers, especially the markdown in inventory reserve and the digital Shipt component of the decline? You said hundreds of millions of dollars for the inventory component, which is $300 million, that's 150 basis points. So how close are we? \n And then as you look ahead to 2Q, given what you've seen in apparel over the past month, has it cleaned -- has your inventory cleaned up? And how do you think about the potential markdown risk in the second quarter? \n [Technical Difficulty] \nMichael Fiddelke: All right. Chris, can you hear me? \nChristopher Horvers: Yes. Well, the anticipation is very high so\u2026 \nMichael Fiddelke: All right. I had a great answer that you heard none of, so I'll try to do my best paraphrasing again. To decompose margin a little bit more, if I had to dimensionalize it into the 3 biggest drivers of what we saw in Q1, the first would be a set of merchandising actions that we took throughout the quarter. And the biggest of which, to your question, was the inventory write-downs and adjustments that we made, especially in apparel given the deceleration we saw in apparel throughout the better part of Q1. That's probably the biggest factor. \n And then as I mentioned in my remarks, category mix at about 150 basis points would be the second biggest factor. And then the third would be the pressure from supply chain in general, and there's a couple of things there. A portion of our investment in the team shows up in margin because supply chain labor shows up in margin. And then the mix shift to digital is there as well. \n But I think it's worth pausing for a moment on that mix shift to digital and the rate pressure that comes with that because I want to spend a second on how I think about digital economics because I think there's real risk in over-rotating on the profit rate headwind that shows up there for a couple of reasons. The first is for the vast majority of those digital transactions and especially the ones where the guest's taking advantage of our same-day services, the sales dollars, the market share dollars and the variable profit dollars from those sales are definitely a good thing. And second, and this is most important, the economics of a digital transaction, as I've said before, are so much bigger than just the single transaction. When we see guests engage with more of our fulfillment choices, they become stronger customers of Target and we build relevance with them in total, and that's where the economics of digital get most powerful. \n As I referenced in the financial community meeting discussions a few months ago, when we see a guest use Drive-Up for the first time, they spend more at Target in total and even more in store than they did previously. And so there's a powerful accelerant of guests becoming stronger users of all of our services. And we had 2 million guests use Drive-Up for the first time in this quarter, and so the long run prospects of that digital growth in terms of what it means with relevancy to our guests, I think, are very powerful. \nBrian Cornell: Chris, it's Brian. Why don't I talk a little bit about Q2, and I'll answer your question but I think a question that's on everyone's mind right now. And before I talk about Q2, we'll go back to the volatility and rapid changes we saw throughout the first quarter, which makes it really difficult for us to project with any kind of certainty how consumers are going to continue to shop in the second quarter and for the balance of the year. As we sit right now, I think the guest that's shopping at Target is still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check. They're shopping in our stores, and we've seen store traffic increase. We're seeing them shop all of our categories while continuing to utilize our same-day fulfillment services. \n But our ability to project how that's going to play out over the balance of the quarter or year is unfortunately something that we can't do today. I think there's just too much uncertainty, too many different variables. As we sit here today, we spend lots of time each and every week talking about what will happen when and if students go back to school or back to college, how will guests shop during the holiday season, starting with Memorial Day. It's all to be determined right now. \n And one of the things that I think we're most proud of as we think about our first quarter performance is how we've adapted week by week, almost day by day to the changing consumer needs. And the flexibility that you've seen in our system is something that we'll lean on throughout the balance of the quarter and the year. But I know everyone is anxious for us to provide a perspective on the second quarter and the full year. Unfortunately, our perspective right now is that we have to be flexible, we have to be adaptable, we have to continue to meet changing consumer needs. And I think we've demonstrated the ability to do that in the first quarter. \nChristopher Horvers: I guess just to push a little bit on it, I mean, to the extent that -- how did you -- as you booked that inventory reserve, I mean, how did you think about the ability to take some of that second quarter risk down? I mean is there a scenario where you could see that gross margin impact from clearance be anywhere near what you just experienced in the first quarter? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. What I'd say, Chris, is this is what our teams do each and every day. And so we react to changing trends and take inventory actions appropriate. And I'd give just a huge hats off to our merchandising teams who have worked through the volatility and sales trends throughout the quarter, both the softness in apparel that leads to some of the write-downs we're talking about in Q1, but in every category that's seen trends deviate from history in such meaningful ways. \nBrian Cornell: And said another way, Chris, I think we feel very good about our inventory position as we go into the second quarter. \nOperator: The next question is from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nEdward Yruma: You guys have done an incredible job ramping Drive-Up. I guess as you kind of assess the service today, what are the key limiters in enhancing throughput there? Is it staffing levels, social distancing? Or is it literally like the physical parking spots? And I guess as you think about ramping it into a more normalized environment, what's your expectation on keeping some of those customers that are trialing it right now? \nBrian Cornell: Ed, I'm going to let John answer this question, but I am smiling. When I think about the fact that during the first quarter, our same-day services grew by 278%, I think John and his team have shown their ability to ramp up as needed. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. I'll just start where Brian left off there. I think that's exactly right. And you saw it accelerate throughout the quarter. Like I said in the remarks, Drive-Up accelerated to 1,000% growth in the month of April. So from a limiter perspective, we think a couple of things which we're looking to address, and we don't really view these as limiters as we know these are things that come with volume. One is parking spaces, to your point, and you'll see us add additional parking slots over the next several months. The second is in-store space, and we are already in process of adding incremental storage space -- flexible and incremental storage space for the store teams. So we feel good about that. \n But from a process perspective, from a team perspective, there are no limiters. And we've talked about this for a few years now, about the scalability of the model of using the stores as hubs. And I think that's really shown through this quarter. \n The other thing I would add that we're really excited about from a Drive-Up perspective, as I said, we've throttled back on expanding temperature-controlled, so fresh, frozen types of products into Drive-Up earlier this quarter. We've resumed that in Minneapolis, also added Kansas City. And early on, our plans have been to get to 3 states this year and then pause and react in scale over next year. Our plan now is to accelerate that and to get to as many stores as possible over the next several months because it's clearly something that our store -- that our guests would like our stores to deliver. \n We're excited about the opportunity there. We're excited to deliver another service for our guests. And the store's ability to execute that has been just phenomenal. \nBrian Cornell: Ed, sitting here today, I've said a number of times to the team, I think we've accelerated our digital fulfillment awareness with the guest and fulfillment capabilities by upwards of 3 years. And I think we'll come out of this first quarter with a much greater awareness around the type of services Target provides, the trust that we're building in same-day, the knowledge that guests have today that if they place an order with Target.com, within 2 hours, they can come to our stores and pick up. They can pull into one of our Drive-Up lanes, and within 2 minutes, we'll put it in their trunk or we'll have a Shipt shopper bring it to their Home within 2 hours. So I think we're going to see a dramatic acceleration in awareness and utilization of those same-day fulfillment capabilities. \nOperator: The next question is from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. \nMatthew McClintock: Congrats to you and the rest of the Target team. Brian, I want to kind of think about this uncertainty in the macro from a different angle. How do you think about consolidation of the industry going forward, whether that be through your digital capabilities or whether that be through, quite frankly, retailers that don't reopen their doors? And how does this compare and contrast to prior economic difficult scenarios or recessions, et cetera, where maybe that type of consolidation didn't happen so when we try to assess your risk going forward, we can actually think about this relative to the past? \nBrian Cornell: So Matt, thanks for joining us again this morning. And I think for several years now, we've been talking about this movement towards consolidation in the industry and the bifurcation that's been taking place over the last couple of years with pronounced winners and, unfortunately, losers in the retail environment. I think, unfortunately -- and I do say that sincerely, unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I think we're going to see an acceleration in that bifurcation. And we've already seen a number of retailers filing for bankruptcy. We expect even further store closures over the next couple of years. And I think it's going to only accelerate the opportunities that companies like Target will have to consolidate market share and continue to grow profitably in this environment. \n I also think from a consumer standpoint, as we survey our guests and as we talk to consumers, I think we're going to see a consolidation in how people shop. And I think our multi-category portfolio positions us very well in an environment where today's consumer is looking to make fewer stops. And the ability to come to Target and pick up their food and beverage needs, their household essentials, their beauty products, their home, apparel items and their household essentials and Hardlines each and every week makes us an attractive choice in a consolidating environment. So sitting here today during, obviously, a point of crisis across America, while we're very humble as we look at our performance and the role we played, we're equally optimistic about the future of Target, and we think this consolidation both in the retail market and how consumers shop will benefit us for years and years to come. \nMatthew McClintock: And then just as a quick follow-up, All in Motion, you clearly launched that into a difficult situation. But I was just wondering if we could get an update on that brand because it does seem like athletic apparel has actually done quite well relative to the rest of the apparel industry during this time of crisis. \nBrian Cornell: Matt, I'm glad you asked. And while we've talked about, obviously, some softness in apparel throughout the quarter, one category that did perform really well was the performance category. As consumers are working from home and spending a lot more time at home, that was certainly a category that performed well, and we are very excited about the potential of All in Motion. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Congratulations on managing through obviously a very tough quarter. I just wanted to go back to the gross margin for a second. And I guess the question is people who are a little more skeptical on how this year is going to shape out for you kind of harp on the fact that there will be significant inventory liquidations across all of retail, and that, that will be something that you have to address from a pricing perspective in your store. And I wanted to just get your thoughts on that a little bit because it does seem that you have pulled forward some of the markdowns that you would otherwise see in 2Q, and 2Q does seem like it might shape up to be better than you'd expected. But wondering if you could just give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about that in terms of your inventory from like a third quarter, fourth quarter perspective even. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. I can start. Thanks for the question. As Brian mentioned, we feel really good about how our inventory is positioned, especially in apparel right now. So we feel like we took the right actions in Q1 to position us right to pursue the sales opportunities in front of us. With respect to the price and promotion environment, again, that's something that we got a lot of history navigating, and we'll be committed to be priced right with appropriate promotion in any environment around us. We watch pretty carefully what's happening in the competition. But especially to see some strength return to apparel at the end of the quarter, I think we feel really good about the go-forward prospects. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. And Karen, one of the teams that we really need to acknowledge as we sit here today is our Target sourcing team who, throughout the quarter, has done a terrific job of, at some points, canceling and then chasing inventory as we've seen changes in trends. And the relationship we have with our own brand vendors, the strength of our vendor matrix that supports us each and every day is something that's really put us in a unique position. And that sourcing team is one of our key capabilities that allows us to adjust to market need. So that team served us well in the first quarter and will position us well over the balance of the year. \nKaren Short: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to ask one other question. It seems like, at least on the food side, we're definitely seeing a lot of conventional competitors really raise prices pretty rapidly in light of the heightened demand. And you guys seem to be holding price points or price positioning. So can you maybe provide a little color on how you think that might be helping you gain share? Because it does seem like the price gaps have widened to unprecedented levels, and I say that on the food side specifically. \nBrian Cornell: Sure. And Karen, as you've heard us talk about for a number of years now, we're committed to being priced right daily, each and every day. And that includes during this pandemic and as we go into the second quarter, and it certainly includes our Food and Beverage category. So we've seen very little change in our everyday pricing throughout the quarter. You have seen a reduction in promotions based on, obviously, limited supply of certain products. But our commitment to delivering great value to our guests in Food and Beverage and in all of our categories persist as we sit here today. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \n Our next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nTracy Kogan: It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. Two questions. I was wondering about the new customers you said you've gained during the quarter. Is there any particular demographic group you're attracting? And then I was also wondering what you've seen with repeat purchases from those customers. And then I just have one follow-up. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. So Tracy, we talked about the fact that we saw 5 million new guests use Target.com. And John talked about the number of new users for Drive-Up, 2 million new Drive-Up users during the quarter. So we're certainly looking at the profile of that customer. But we recognize the stickiness that comes along with that. And I'll let John talk about the reaction we get when people use our same-day services and the high Net Promoter Scores we continue to receive. \n And I think we're going to recognize, coming out of this first quarter and the pandemic, that guests are going to continue to gravitate towards the convenience and the contact-free element that Drive-Up allows. So we're seeing a great response. Lots of new guests using Target.com and Drive-Up, and we expect that to continue over the balance of the year. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. The thing I would add, the great thing we saw throughout the quarter, and again, really proud of our teams, is Drive-Up is our highest Net Promoter Score, Shipt is a very high Net Promoter Score, pickup is a high Net Promoter Score. And then the in-store experience Net Promoter Score -- across all of those scores, absent the usual week-to-week volatility that we see, all of them remained steady even at the peak. When we were -- as things accelerated very quickly into our digital channels, we saw a great Net Promoter scores. \n And as Brian said, that is the best indicator of guests coming back to us. We've already seen 40% of the Drive-Up guests repeat purchase. So we focused all quarter long with all of our teams on ensuring that we can provide a great guest experience. And when we do that, we see them come back and use our services again. \nTracy Kogan: Great. And then my follow-up was if you could comment generally on the national brand versus private brand performance in the quarter and then specifically how Good & Gather performed. \nBrian Cornell: I'll start with Good & Gather, and that was an important part of the over 20% growth we saw in Food and Beverage. You'll see us actually as we move into the second quarter begin to expand the number of items in the Good & Gather brand. So we feel really good about the guest response during the pandemic, and we expect that to continue over the balance of the year. \n And at this point, I probably need to just pause and thank many of our national branded vendors and the support that they provided us during the first quarter. Obviously, unprecedented levels of growth. We talked about the type of growth we saw in household essentials, in Food and Beverage but -- in so many of our categories. And our national branded vendors did a superb job of working hand in hand with our buyers, our supply chain team to meet the demand and get us the product we need, and a big thanks to all of our national branded partners. We appreciate everything they've done. \nOperator: The next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: My congrats as well on the execution, pretty incredible, so thank you for that because I am a customer. Actually, just some follow-up on digital. One was on Shipt. I was wondering if you could talk about the membership growth that you saw in the first quarter. And we've seen pretty dramatic app download data on Shipt. And also, are you signing up a lot more partners on Shipt? \n And then my follow-up would just be maybe for Brian or John or Michael. Just with this huge digital volume, are there anything you're learning about whether it's going to be tougher or easier over the long term as you average out much higher digital volumes? Are you seeing new ways to get the profitability up that maybe you weren't seeing before this big ramp-up in volume? \nBrian Cornell: So Robby, why don't we let John start by talking about the outstanding performance we saw with Shipt, and then we'll come back and talk about digital profitability over time. \nJohn Mulligan: Robby, good to talk to you. Shipt, consistent with everything else we've said about digital, has seen -- saw significant acceleration in that they and their team did an outstanding job hiring into that or getting Shipt shoppers. Order volume over the course of the quarter for Shipt business independent of Target's portion of that order volume was up 2x. In April, it was up 3x. They had 60% growth in membership, so a significant acceleration in members. They engaged 100,000 additional shoppers, so doubling the number of shoppers they had going into the quarter, and so a significant acceleration across Target. We saw a 300% increase in sales to last year through our Shipt channel. So again, significant acceleration there. \n And like I said on a previous caller, probably -- perhaps most importantly, the NPS score, very, very high, and they maintained that throughout the quarter. A few dips when sales really accelerated quickly within a week to 10 days, but beyond that, the team did an exceptional job in really getting shoppers to meet that demand. And so we're really enthusiastic about the Shipt performance and encouraged by what we saw. \nMichael Fiddelke: And I can maybe just chime in on the prospects for increased efficiency over time. We've seen across wherever we've had growth, whether it's the growth in Drive-Up over the last several years, Order Pickup, volume helps us. And with volume, we can bring efficiency. And when it comes to digital, as John mentioned, we've been investing in planning and capability to support this volume. We just thought it would be 3 years from now. And so we've seen an acceleration for what we would have expected to take 3 years that's now happened in a matter of weeks. And so as we get the chance to optimize some of our operations against that volume, we should be able to drive increased efficiency over time. \n But the thing I'm most excited about on the digital front that we've touched on a little bit already is just the opportunity we have to capture relevance with guests as their shopping habits change. We know over the long run, when guest behavior changes -- and that's why a family with a new baby in the house is such an important guest milestone for us, where we want to show up because that's when shopping habits can change. Back to college, the first time you move into your new home, those milestones matter to us as a retailer and always have because that's when shopping habits can change. And I think across America right now, we're seeing an acceleration in the change of shopping habits as it relates to digital. And the way we've shown up with 280-plus percent growth in digital in April means we're capturing a lot of that mind share and those new routines as they're forming. \nBrian Cornell: And Robby, I just -- I'd finish up by going back to our strategy and using our stores as fulfillment hubs. And as we talked about our performance with digital, although the 141% growth rate is a stunning number, the number I really focus on is the same-day fulfillment, which grew by 278%, and that was all fulfilled by our stores. And if you actually look at a different metric, if we think about store-fulfilled comps during the first quarter, while we grew by 10.8% overall, if I look at that store-fulfilled comp number, that increased by over 9%. It means our stores are driving tremendous productivity, and they are the center of our strategy. And that's a number you'll hear us talk about more and more and more. \n So when we talk about store comps during the quarter, they look relatively low at just under 1%. But those stores actually drove over 9% comp growth during the quarter. And from an economic standpoint, we know over time, that's a really healthy and profitable transaction. So the stores did tremendous work during this quarter. And America turned to Target stores because they trust our service and our reliability and rewarded us with a store-fulfilled comp of over 9%. \nOperator: Our last question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. \nOliver Chen: Brian, what would you prioritize as some of the most surprising and/or permanent changes from the crisis? And John, I was curious about the future of automation and robotics. Especially as you do a really great job using stores as hubs, how do you see that playing out in store with Drive-Up and with inventory management accuracy? \nBrian Cornell: Oliver, why don't I start. And when I think about the quarter and some of the learning from the quarter, I'll have to go back with the importance of stores. And at the start of the pandemic, and we've talked about the different chapters, America turned to Target stores. And that's where we saw the uptick. That's where they came for household essentials, they stocked up on food and beverage. So when America was asked to shelter in place, they started to use our same-day fulfillment channels and were picking up in store and driving to our parking lots to use Drive-Up or using a Shipt shopper. \n But when I think about the quarter, it just reinforces to me the important role that stores play, both our traditional stores and even our smaller formats in urban markets. There's a number of e-mails I've received from guests in New York City and Boston and Chicago thanking us for that small format in their neighborhood that supplied all of their household and family needs during the pandemic. So my highlight and takeaway is stores are vitally important, and stores will continue to play a really important role to America as we go forward. \nJohn Mulligan: And then on your second question, Oliver, on automation, analytics, technology, as you know, we've been pursuing that on several fronts. I think to the last half of your question about inventory allocation, inventory placement, as you know, we've been developing analytics and technology across something we call inventory planning and control, IPC. We're about 1/3 of the way into that deployment. We paused much of that for this quarter. The teams are assessing right now what time line we want to get back on to begin deploying that further across the chain. We feel really, really good about the opportunity for us to improve what we're doing from an inventory placement with that technology and analytics. \n And then from an automation perspective, we've talked about we had analytics -- or automation pilot going on in Minneapolis, also at Perth. In Minneapolis, we actually deployed that automation to 4 more locations. We have not started that up yet because that will require some travel, and we want to -- we will take the safety of our teams into account as we think about getting back into the travel game. But when we are able to do that, we'll get that to 4 more locations this year and then continue to expand. Out of Perth, the teams have made great, great progress here even while we haven't been able to get into that building. And so when we do get into that building, we'll do some final testing to scale it out and then begin, as I said a couple of months ago, to think about where we deploy that next, somewhere within our network and an existing facility. \n So you'll see us continue to expand automation. When it comes to store automation, I think we've shown the ability to scale very, very rapidly with our teams and with the technology that we have provided them. And so we feel very, very good about the productivity and scalability and reliability of our current processes and teams. And we'll continue to explore other avenues as we go forward to improve that. \nBrian Cornell: So to John's point, automation will be important, Oliver. But as we sit here today, I think the most important thing to focus on is execution. And I think in this environment, we've earned the trust of American shoppers with great execution and our commitment to providing a safe shopping environment. And you'll see us continue to commit to safety and trust as we go forward over the balance of the year. \n So operator, that concludes our call today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. I hope you stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to the day when we can be meeting again face to face. So thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. On these calls over the last few years, I've described our long-term journey in operations to completely transform our supply chain and fulfillment infrastructure, moving from our prior linear model based exclusively on store shopping to a unique modern structure designed to support a broad array of fulfillment choices; to position our stores as the hub for guest fulfillment, whether a guest trip is based on traditional shopping, use of one of our same-day services or delivering a package to their front door; to invest in technology, data and analytics to increase our inventory accuracy and better forecast demand throughout the network, leading to improved in-stocks, higher guest satisfaction and ultimately, stronger sales; to transform how we select and build store sites, moving from a rigid, large-format prototype model to a model in which we focus first on the neighborhood we want to serve, design a store to fit within the available space and then curate a merchandise assortment to fit that particular neighborhood; and finally, to transform our store team, moving from a model based on general athletes to one in which different parts of the team have accountability for individual businesses, supported by tools and processes that allow them to make decisions in real time and focus on serving our guests in new ways. One goal of all these changes was to make our operations and our team far more nimble and agile in support of our guests. And while the journey is far from over, this quarter demonstrated the benefits of everything we have already accomplished. \n As Brian already described, over the course of the first quarter, our team had to pivot dramatically and rapidly in response to multiple changes in shopping behavior: comps in essentials and Food and Beverage moving from single digits in February to peaks above 50% in March before settling down into the teens in April; apparel trends moving just as rapidly in the other direction, from positive single digits at the beginning of the quarter to trough declines of more than 50% beginning in late March, before resuming growth in the last half of April. With this volatility in category sales, managing our inventory has also presented a significant challenge. In apparel, given the recent dramatic slowdown in sales, teams have been working closely with vendors to make appropriate changes based on our current inventory and future purchases. \n Across the remainder of our core merchandising categories, we've seen a dramatic increase in the pace of sales causing out-of-stocks to rise well above where we'd like them to be. In need-based categories like Food and Beverage and essentials where comps have accelerated into the 20% range, we have been on allocation from multiple vendors as they work to ramp up production to cover the higher level of demand. Among some categories like paper, in-stocks have been recovering in recent weeks. But across many portions of both essentials and Food and Beverage, we continue to sell out quickly when we receive shipments of products from our vendors. In other categories like Home and electronics, we have been increasing order quantities to match the higher pace of sales. However, given that many of these categories are primarily imported, we will likely see some persistent out-of-stocks until we can receive replenishment inventory from these overseas producers. \n Beyond categories, the volatility in shopping channels has been just as extreme, store comps moving from positive numbers to double-digit declines in late March and early April, then back to growth towards the end of April; digital comps moving from around 30% in February to nearly 10x that pace in April. Through all of these extremes, the team maintained a positive attitude and demonstrated their pride in the positive role that they're playing in our guests' lives. I am humbled and inspired by what they've been able to deliver on behalf of our guests. The ability of our team and our network to attain and sustain digital comps of nearly 300% for the entire month of April has been incredible to watch. \n There are too many stats to share, but I'll tick through a few because I think they're helpful in understanding how remarkable it's been. Multiple measures of unit volume, including ship-from-store, Target orders fulfilled by Shipt and overall digital, were higher in the first quarter of 2020 than in the first 3 quarters of 2019 combined. Units provided through Drive-Up in the first quarter were higher than in all of 2019. Sales of orders shipped from stores or picked up in stores increased nearly 150% in the first quarter. Target sales fulfilled by Shipt were up more than 300%, and sales through Drive-Up were up more than 600% higher than a year ago. \n In April, sales on Drive-Up increased nearly 1,000% compared with a year ago. These growth numbers reflect the fact that Drive-Up continues to be our most popular service and the number of guests who are trying and repeatedly using Drive-Up continues to increase rapidly. Specifically, more than 5 million guests used our Drive-Up service in the first quarter, with 40% of these guests new to the service. And amazingly, despite this unexpected explosion in first quarter digital volume, the team continues to execute with amazing speed. Both the percent of orders shipped from store on time and the percent of pickup and Drive-Up orders picked on time was approximately 95% in the quarter, and both measures were higher than the first quarter a year ago. \n One thing we've observed about this crisis is that it is causing an acceleration in consumer trial and adoption of digital shopping. The ability of our operations to handle this unexpected acceleration has given us even stronger conviction that we have the right model and we have ample capacity to handle continued change in the future. Specifically, as part of our long-range plans at the beginning of 2020, our first quarter digital volumes weren't anticipated for another 3 years, but our operations accommodated that extra volume without any advanced planning. Like Brian said, it was an extreme test of our model and our team, and both performed admirably in the face of the challenge. \n Another area in which the crisis has accelerated existing trends relates to the amount of retail square footage in the U.S. We have long understood that the U.S. market is over-stored, and we've all observed the rationalization of unproductive retail space in recent years. But let me quickly say we continue to strongly believe that the future of U.S. retail will be based on an omnichannel model, in which quality retailers will serve their customers through both physical and digital capabilities. That's why we've consistently pursued a strategy based on investments to enhance both physical and digital shopping. \n And while we have temporarily slowed down our plans for remodels and new stores because of the crisis, that doesn't mean we have less enthusiasm for these projects. Rather, we slowed down our plans for 2 specific reasons. First, we wanted to remove obstacles and distractions facing our team so they could focus exclusively on day-to-day execution in the face of extreme volatility across multiple dimensions of our business. And second, we adjusted our plans in anticipation of construction process changes needed to accommodate social distancing and other measures, which we expect to slow down time lines in some cases. In addition, we expect that more time will be required for inspections and permitting related to these projects given the incremental demands facing local governments in light of this crisis. \n So while it is too soon to lay out longer-term time lines for our remodel and new store programs, we look forward to resuming these projects when appropriate. This will allow us to continue to transform our real estate footprint, both through modernization of existing space and the selective addition of productive new small-format locations located in neighborhoods that couldn't be served when we only opened larger stores. \n A strategic initiative that we temporarily paused during the first quarter was integration of fresh, refrigerated and frozen items into our pickup and Drive-Up capabilities. While we are eager to add this capability and we know our guests want the option, we decided not to add the distraction of implementing this test during the period of peak volatility. However, we recently resumed the test in the Twin Cities market, where it had already begun last year, and we've just expanded the test into the Kansas City market. Operational results have been positive so far. And while we will continue to govern the pace of the rollout based on the circumstances facing our team, we are committed to rolling out this capability to as many stores as possible this year. \n Another exciting strategic development was our recent acquisition of local route optimization technology from Deliv. Following encouraging results of recent tests of this new capability, we elected to purchase the technology and hired members of their team to assist with the integration into our existing systems and processes. We are excited about this new technology because it offers the opportunity to add capacity to our fulfillment network while also reducing the cost of last-mile delivery. And given that last mile is the biggest cost driver within digital, the opportunity to control those costs will play an important role in our operating margins over time. \n With the benefit of this new technology, we can begin testing the addition of sort centers, downstream of our stores within our fulfillment network. These centers, which we expect to be smaller than our average store, will be placed downstream in select markets in which we have a high density of packages being sent to guests' homes. By eliminating the need to sort packages in the individual stores, the throughput of packages from these locations would naturally increase, and we can achieve lower average shipping costs through the scale and route optimization that these downstream centers will provide. \n Given that we only recently acquired this new technology, we don't yet have a time line for this test. What I can say today is that we are planning to test the first of these centers in the Minneapolis market and that we plan to follow our normal discipline of testing and iterating before we decide to scale up. \n So now as I get ready to hand the call over to Michael, I want to end where I started and give a special thanks to our store, distribution and fulfillment center teams. Our society has long recognized the sacrifice of essential workers in the health care industry and public service like police officers and firefighters, but what's been remarkable on this crisis is to see how it has helped people to realize there's a huge army of essential team members at Target and many other retailers who make sure that parents can get food for their family and the essentials they need to manage their health and their household. I've long appreciated the work of these teams since I've been lucky to work alongside them for more than 2 decades, but now with our efforts in the spotlight, I could not be more proud to see their significant contributions recognized. \n Thank you to every one on our team for your hard work and sincere desire to serve all of the families that place their trust in Target every day. Michael? Yes. I'll just start where Brian left off there. I think that's exactly right. And you saw it accelerate throughout the quarter. Like I said in the remarks, Drive-Up accelerated to 1,000% growth in the month of April. So from a limiter perspective, we think a couple of things which we're looking to address, and we don't really view these as limiters as we know these are things that come with volume. One is parking spaces, to your point, and you'll see us add additional parking slots over the next several months. The second is in-store space, and we are already in process of adding incremental storage space -- flexible and incremental storage space for the store teams. So we feel good about that. \n But from a process perspective, from a team perspective, there are no limiters. And we've talked about this for a few years now, about the scalability of the model of using the stores as hubs. And I think that's really shown through this quarter. \n The other thing I would add that we're really excited about from a Drive-Up perspective, as I said, we've throttled back on expanding temperature-controlled, so fresh, frozen types of products into Drive-Up earlier this quarter. We've resumed that in Minneapolis, also added Kansas City. And early on, our plans have been to get to 3 states this year and then pause and react in scale over next year. Our plan now is to accelerate that and to get to as many stores as possible over the next several months because it's clearly something that our store -- that our guests would like our stores to deliver. \n We're excited about the opportunity there. We're excited to deliver another service for our guests. And the store's ability to execute that has been just phenomenal. Yes. I can start. Thanks for the question. As Brian mentioned, we feel really good about how our inventory is positioned, especially in apparel right now. So we feel like we took the right actions in Q1 to position us right to pursue the sales opportunities in front of us. With respect to the price and promotion environment, again, that's something that we got a lot of history navigating, and we'll be committed to be priced right with appropriate promotion in any environment around us. We watch pretty carefully what's happening in the competition. But especially to see some strength return to apparel at the end of the quarter, I think we feel really good about the go-forward prospects. Yes. The thing I would add, the great thing we saw throughout the quarter, and again, really proud of our teams, is Drive-Up is our highest Net Promoter Score, Shipt is a very high Net Promoter Score, pickup is a high Net Promoter Score. And then the in-store experience Net Promoter Score -- across all of those scores, absent the usual week-to-week volatility that we see, all of them remained steady even at the peak. When we were -- as things accelerated very quickly into our digital channels, we saw a great Net Promoter scores. \n And as Brian said, that is the best indicator of guests coming back to us. We've already seen 40% of the Drive-Up guests repeat purchase. So we focused all quarter long with all of our teams on ensuring that we can provide a great guest experience. And when we do that, we see them come back and use our services again. Robby, good to talk to you. Shipt, consistent with everything else we've said about digital, has seen -- saw significant acceleration in that they and their team did an outstanding job hiring into that or getting Shipt shoppers. Order volume over the course of the quarter for Shipt business independent of Target's portion of that order volume was up 2x. In April, it was up 3x. They had 60% growth in membership, so a significant acceleration in members. They engaged 100,000 additional shoppers, so doubling the number of shoppers they had going into the quarter, and so a significant acceleration across Target. We saw a 300% increase in sales to last year through our Shipt channel. So again, significant acceleration there. \n And like I said on a previous caller, probably -- perhaps most importantly, the NPS score, very, very high, and they maintained that throughout the quarter. A few dips when sales really accelerated quickly within a week to 10 days, but beyond that, the team did an exceptional job in really getting shoppers to meet that demand. And so we're really enthusiastic about the Shipt performance and encouraged by what we saw. And then on your second question, Oliver, on automation, analytics, technology, as you know, we've been pursuing that on several fronts. I think to the last half of your question about inventory allocation, inventory placement, as you know, we've been developing analytics and technology across something we call inventory planning and control, IPC. We're about 1/3 of the way into that deployment. We paused much of that for this quarter. The teams are assessing right now what time line we want to get back on to begin deploying that further across the chain. We feel really, really good about the opportunity for us to improve what we're doing from an inventory placement with that technology and analytics. \n And then from an automation perspective, we've talked about we had analytics -- or automation pilot going on in Minneapolis, also at Perth. In Minneapolis, we actually deployed that automation to 4 more locations. We have not started that up yet because that will require some travel, and we want to -- we will take the safety of our teams into account as we think about getting back into the travel game. But when we are able to do that, we'll get that to 4 more locations this year and then continue to expand. Out of Perth, the teams have made great, great progress here even while we haven't been able to get into that building. And so when we do get into that building, we'll do some final testing to scale it out and then begin, as I said a couple of months ago, to think about where we deploy that next, somewhere within our network and an existing facility. \n So you'll see us continue to expand automation. When it comes to store automation, I think we've shown the ability to scale very, very rapidly with our teams and with the technology that we have provided them. And so we feel very, very good about the productivity and scalability and reliability of our current processes and teams. And we'll continue to explore other avenues as we go forward to improve that."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate that you've joined us on this morning's call, and we hope that you, your family and friends are safe and healthy. It goes without saying but this quarter was unlike anything we've seen in our company's long history. And while we didn't establish another all-time record for this quarter's EPS, I have never been more proud of our performance. \n Over the last few years, we built a strategy and operating model that's designed to generate strong performance in a wide variety of environments, and the first quarter demonstrated the strength of that model. Unprecedented volatility within the quarter presented the most extreme test of our business and operations that I could have imagined, and in that environment, we drove industry-leading growth with a total comp sales increase of 10.8% and digital comp growth of more than 140%. \n As I reflect on all that's transpired since the quarter began in February, there were 2 key factors in our success: our strategy of positioning stores and fulfillment hubs and our unbelievable team. When guests began flocking to our stores to stock up, our team was ready. And when digital demand exploded as guests began to shelter in place, our teams have the tools, processes and capability to flex to meet that shift in demand. \n But it goes well beyond processes and tools because our team's efforts on behalf of our guests and communities have been monumental. The pride our team has shown and their willingness and ability to deliver essential products and services to our guests is humbling and inspiring. Our guests are putting their trust in Target. The team is delivering, and they deserve our enduring gratitude. \n At our financial community meeting at the beginning of March, we highlighted multiple dimensions of flexibility built into our operating model. We offer a balanced merchandising assortment that is unique in retail, allowing Target to serve our guests' rapidly evolving demands for wants and needs. We have a unique digital strategy based on a curated assortment of the categories and items that our guests expect from us. We deliver this digital assortment through a comprehensive suite of fulfillment options, including our rapidly growing same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive-Up and Shipt. \n In support of our digital strategy, we place our stores at the center of fulfillment, which gives us both speed and efficiency. This structure also allows our teams to pivot seamlessly when our guests' channel preferences change. We have teams at headquarters, stores and throughout the supply chain who are relentlessly focused on our guests and who place a premium on agility and adaptability. And with a strong balance sheet and a business model that generates robust cash flow, we have the financial flexibility to handle difficult times like this, allowing us to fund investments in the safety of our guests and our team while serving a critical role in communities as a trusted essential retailer. \n Given our unique assortment and comprehensive suite of fulfillment options, we could see firsthand as our guests' mindset rapidly evolved during the first quarter. While it already feels like years ago, during the first 3 weeks of February, we experienced a relatively normal mix of sales across merchandising assortment and a typical mix of sales between our stores and digital channels. Towards the end of February, we saw an acceleration in traffic and sales, particularly in our stores. However, we continue to see a lot of cross-shopping in the more discretionary categories when the guests made trips to stock up on food and essentials. \n Around the middle of March, the mix of guests' purchases became much more nearly focused on food, beverages and household essentials, and we began seeing much softer trends in discretionary categories, most notably in apparel. In addition, as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, guests began to pull back on store trips, and we saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales. We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware in our home assortment. \n And finally, around the middle of April, we experienced a rapid increase in traffic and sales in our stores and a broad surge in sales of more discretionary categories, including apparel, which persisted throughout the end of the month. The surge in stores occurred while our digital growth continued at unprecedented rates of 200% to 300% above last year. As a result, over the last couple of weeks of April, we saw some of the strongest comparable sales growth we've experienced in our history. When you put all these chapters together and look at the first quarter in total, our comparable sales grew nearly 11% with a wide range of performance across categories as guests changed their shopping pattern in response to the crisis. \n Among our 5 core merchandising categories, we saw the strongest performance in Hardlines, which grew comparable sales by well over 20%. Growth was particularly strong in electronics where comps grew more than 45%, reflecting high demand for video games and home office items. Essentials & Beauty saw high-teen comp growth while comps in Food and Beverage grew by more than 20% as guests trusted Target for both their stock-up trips and their everyday needs. \n In Home, we saw high single-digit comp growth, led by kitchen, which saw comp growth in excess of 25%. And in apparel, first quarter comparable sales declined about 20%, reflecting soft sales in late March into early April, followed by a resumption of growth in the last 2 weeks of April. As we evaluate these category trends relative to overall U.S. retail and on a category-by-category basis, we are seeing unprecedented share gains across every measure. \n Clearly, in portions of our business, share statistics reflect the fact that nonessential retailers across the country have remained largely closed. And even though we compete with them, we sincerely look forward to the day when our retail colleagues can reopen. After all, a healthy retail sector is critical to the overall health of the U.S. economy. And of course, employees of our competitors often shop at Target, too. \n More fundamentally, we believe recent share numbers reflect the trust that our guests have placed in our stores, our digital capabilities, our team and our brand. In particular, as our teams have risen to meet our guests' needs and deliver friendly, reliable service during this unprecedented time, we believe that our guests' level of trust has only become deeper throughout this crisis. \n From a channel perspective, first quarter store sales grew about 1% while digital comp sales increased by 141%. Of course, these quarterly numbers mask how quickly trends changed within the quarter. Specifically, we began the quarter with a relatively normal February, in which we saw overall comp growth of 3.8% and digital comp growth of 33%, and ended in April which saw total company comp growth of more than 16% and a jaw-dropping 282% increase in digital comp sales. \n I want to pause and comment on that April digital performance for a moment because I suspect that many of you might have wondered whether our operations could sustain such a strong increase for an entire month. After all, to put this volume into perspective, on an average day in April, our operations were fulfilling many more items and orders than last year's Cyber Monday, a day for which we had planned months ahead of time. In contrast, this unprecedented surge in volume was completely unexpected at the beginning of the quarter, and it ramped up from normal trends in a matter of weeks. \n And by design, it was our stores that enabled this surge in digital volume, fulfilling more than 80% of our digital sales in April. Even more impressive, within our April digital sales growth of just over $1.1 billion compared with last year, store fulfillment accounted for more than $950 million of that growth as both our same-day services and shipments to guests' homes saw significant increases. \n How is this accomplished? John will provide more details in a few minutes, but I'd reiterate that it comes down to 2 factors: our strategy of using our stores as hubs and the ability of our team to quickly pivot to meet shifting demand. And while we incurred extra costs to accommodate this incredible surge in digital fulfillment, we expect to gain a long-term benefit in terms of guest loyalty. \n During the first quarter, more than 5 million guests shopped on Target.com for the first time, with more than 2 million of those guests making their first Drive-Up trip. And because of the amazing flexibility of our team, we saw consistently strong levels of satisfaction with the Target.com shopping experience even in the face of crushing increase in demand. \n So now I want to turn to our focus going forward, which isn't going to change. We continue to focus on serving our guests while taking steps to provide for their safety. And we'll continue to focus on our teams, investing in their safety and their well-being while working to remove obstacles and allow them to serve guests during this critical time. \n Throughout this evolving crisis, we have continually adapted our operations and processes to enhance guest and team member safety. Looking ahead, we'll continue to quickly adapt to changes in the environment and emerging guidance from the CDC and other authorities. Already during the first quarter, we took numerous steps to protect our guests, Shipt shoppers and our team members, including enhanced cleaning standards, providing personal protective equipment to our team members and Shipt shoppers, installing plexiglass dividers at checkout and implementing metering protocols in our stores where appropriate. For our team, we rolled out a wellness checklist for them to perform before each Shipt and provided free thermometers to team members who needed them. \n We also invested hundreds of million dollars in extra pay and benefits for our team, adding $2 to their hourly wage, investing in enhanced backup daycare options across the country and offering enhanced paid leave for team members with vulnerable health conditions. Consistent with our long-standing commitment to the communities where we live and work, we donated personal protective equipment to over 50 health care organizations and shared tools and expertise with government partners and other businesses to help protect health care workers and assist other businesses in reopening and operating safely. \n In addition, we recently announced our foundation's biggest single donation in company history, $10 million, to assist team members, communities, national organizations and the global response to this pandemic. Beyond our corporate commitment, thousands of team members are volunteering in their local communities, including a group of 3D-printing enthusiasts on our technology team who are using their personal devices to produce and donate plastic face shields to local hospitals. \n And most recently, just this week, we announced the extension of higher pay and enhanced benefits for our team through the end of June. We initially announced these temporary changes to the end of April, and last month, we announced we were extending them through May. And today, even as the country is starting to talk about how things will look when we get back to normal, our teams continue to face unprecedented challenges as they serve families and their communities. As a result, we're proud to support our amazing team members as they navigate through these challenging times. \n In terms of our financial expectations, Michael will offer his perspective in a few minutes, but we're maintaining our recent suspension of financial guidance. From today's perspective, the one thing that seems most certain is continued volatility, and whenever possible, we're building flexibility into our plans and commitments. But let me be clear, the expectation of continued volatility in the external environment doesn't translate to a lack of confidence about our future. \n If there's one thing our team and operators have demonstrated, it's the ability to adapt to rapid change and continuing delivering outstanding service for our guests. And as I said before, it's at times like these that we can all see the benefit of a strong balance sheet and fundamentally sound business model. The financial strength gives us the flexibility to focus on what matters most, our guests and our team, giving us confidence that we'll emerge from this crisis as a stronger, more relevant retailer with an even higher level of affinity and trust among our guests. \n So as I turn the call over to John, I want to once again offer my thanks to the entire Target team, from headquarters to our operations and offices around the world. I've never been part of a stronger team, and I share your pride in the essential role that Target is playing in the lives of our guests. \n Thank you for your inspiring efforts every day. John? Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to close by reiterating some of the points we shared today. I want to start with something Michael said earlier. \n These times are anything but normal. Guests are facing unprecedented changes in the way they're living and the way they're working. In a matter of weeks, the economy has moved from historically low levels of unemployment to some of the highest ever recorded. Not surprisingly, consumer shopping patterns have been changing significantly and frequently as everyone tries to navigate through these changes. And so things that we might have once taken for granted have suddenly become front and center in our minds. We have renewed appreciation for the things we need in our homes every day, items like food, paper goods and cleaning products that are now more important than ever as we shelter in place and work remotely. In addition, we have a renewed appreciation for the people that make sure we have those products, including the people who produce them, the supply chains that move them and the teams that provide them in stores and bring them to our homes. \n The crisis has clearly demonstrated the essential role of our team members as they offer compassionate, friendly service and do everything possible to ensure that their neighbors have what they need. Like John said, it's humbling and inspiring to work alongside our team and feel their passion and resolve as they persevere through this crisis. They're the heart and soul of Target and the reason I'm so confident in our future. \n With that, we'll move to Q&A. John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Ed, thanks for joining us. We certainly saw an uptick, as we reported, starting on April 15 as stimulus checks arrived across America. And as we reported, we saw a return of a guest who was shopping in our stores but continuing to use our digital fulfillment channels. And we started to see normalization across all of our categories, an uptick again in categories like apparel and Home, but continued strength in our entire portfolio. \n And that's continued through the balance of April. That stabilization, normalization of category shopping has continued in May as we continue to see an uptick in digital fulfillment. So while we're not providing guidance today, we certainly are seeing a more normalized shopping environment both in our stores and online and a guest who's shopping all of our categories, including those discretionary categories like Home and apparel. Ed, we're watching it carefully. It's still very early, but I think what we're seeing throughout these last few weeks is the trust that we've earned with American consumers who continue to turn to Target for those household essentials, their food and beverage and now apparel and home items as well as the strength we've seen in Hardlines throughout the quarter. As Americans still work from home and educate their families at home, we provide essential services throughout the pandemic, and we're seeing that continue as states open up across the country. Chris, it's Brian. Why don't I talk a little bit about Q2, and I'll answer your question but I think a question that's on everyone's mind right now. And before I talk about Q2, we'll go back to the volatility and rapid changes we saw throughout the first quarter, which makes it really difficult for us to project with any kind of certainty how consumers are going to continue to shop in the second quarter and for the balance of the year. As we sit right now, I think the guest that's shopping at Target is still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check. They're shopping in our stores, and we've seen store traffic increase. We're seeing them shop all of our categories while continuing to utilize our same-day fulfillment services. \n But our ability to project how that's going to play out over the balance of the quarter or year is unfortunately something that we can't do today. I think there's just too much uncertainty, too many different variables. As we sit here today, we spend lots of time each and every week talking about what will happen when and if students go back to school or back to college, how will guests shop during the holiday season, starting with Memorial Day. It's all to be determined right now. \n And one of the things that I think we're most proud of as we think about our first quarter performance is how we've adapted week by week, almost day by day to the changing consumer needs. And the flexibility that you've seen in our system is something that we'll lean on throughout the balance of the quarter and the year. But I know everyone is anxious for us to provide a perspective on the second quarter and the full year. Unfortunately, our perspective right now is that we have to be flexible, we have to be adaptable, we have to continue to meet changing consumer needs. And I think we've demonstrated the ability to do that in the first quarter. And said another way, Chris, I think we feel very good about our inventory position as we go into the second quarter. Ed, I'm going to let John answer this question, but I am smiling. When I think about the fact that during the first quarter, our same-day services grew by 278%, I think John and his team have shown their ability to ramp up as needed. Ed, sitting here today, I've said a number of times to the team, I think we've accelerated our digital fulfillment awareness with the guest and fulfillment capabilities by upwards of 3 years. And I think we'll come out of this first quarter with a much greater awareness around the type of services Target provides, the trust that we're building in same-day, the knowledge that guests have today that if they place an order with Target.com, within 2 hours, they can come to our stores and pick up. They can pull into one of our Drive-Up lanes, and within 2 minutes, we'll put it in their trunk or we'll have a Shipt shopper bring it to their Home within 2 hours. So I think we're going to see a dramatic acceleration in awareness and utilization of those same-day fulfillment capabilities. So Matt, thanks for joining us again this morning. And I think for several years now, we've been talking about this movement towards consolidation in the industry and the bifurcation that's been taking place over the last couple of years with pronounced winners and, unfortunately, losers in the retail environment. I think, unfortunately -- and I do say that sincerely, unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I think we're going to see an acceleration in that bifurcation. And we've already seen a number of retailers filing for bankruptcy. We expect even further store closures over the next couple of years. And I think it's going to only accelerate the opportunities that companies like Target will have to consolidate market share and continue to grow profitably in this environment. \n I also think from a consumer standpoint, as we survey our guests and as we talk to consumers, I think we're going to see a consolidation in how people shop. And I think our multi-category portfolio positions us very well in an environment where today's consumer is looking to make fewer stops. And the ability to come to Target and pick up their food and beverage needs, their household essentials, their beauty products, their home, apparel items and their household essentials and Hardlines each and every week makes us an attractive choice in a consolidating environment. So sitting here today during, obviously, a point of crisis across America, while we're very humble as we look at our performance and the role we played, we're equally optimistic about the future of Target, and we think this consolidation both in the retail market and how consumers shop will benefit us for years and years to come. Matt, I'm glad you asked. And while we've talked about, obviously, some softness in apparel throughout the quarter, one category that did perform really well was the performance category. As consumers are working from home and spending a lot more time at home, that was certainly a category that performed well, and we are very excited about the potential of All in Motion. Yes. And Karen, one of the teams that we really need to acknowledge as we sit here today is our Target sourcing team who, throughout the quarter, has done a terrific job of, at some points, canceling and then chasing inventory as we've seen changes in trends. And the relationship we have with our own brand vendors, the strength of our vendor matrix that supports us each and every day is something that's really put us in a unique position. And that sourcing team is one of our key capabilities that allows us to adjust to market need. So that team served us well in the first quarter and will position us well over the balance of the year. Sure. And Karen, as you've heard us talk about for a number of years now, we're committed to being priced right daily, each and every day. And that includes during this pandemic and as we go into the second quarter, and it certainly includes our Food and Beverage category. So we've seen very little change in our everyday pricing throughout the quarter. You have seen a reduction in promotions based on, obviously, limited supply of certain products. But our commitment to delivering great value to our guests in Food and Beverage and in all of our categories persist as we sit here today. Yes. So Tracy, we talked about the fact that we saw 5 million new guests use Target.com. And John talked about the number of new users for Drive-Up, 2 million new Drive-Up users during the quarter. So we're certainly looking at the profile of that customer. But we recognize the stickiness that comes along with that. And I'll let John talk about the reaction we get when people use our same-day services and the high Net Promoter Scores we continue to receive. \n And I think we're going to recognize, coming out of this first quarter and the pandemic, that guests are going to continue to gravitate towards the convenience and the contact-free element that Drive-Up allows. So we're seeing a great response. Lots of new guests using Target.com and Drive-Up, and we expect that to continue over the balance of the year. I'll start with Good & Gather, and that was an important part of the over 20% growth we saw in Food and Beverage. You'll see us actually as we move into the second quarter begin to expand the number of items in the Good & Gather brand. So we feel really good about the guest response during the pandemic, and we expect that to continue over the balance of the year. \n And at this point, I probably need to just pause and thank many of our national branded vendors and the support that they provided us during the first quarter. Obviously, unprecedented levels of growth. We talked about the type of growth we saw in household essentials, in Food and Beverage but -- in so many of our categories. And our national branded vendors did a superb job of working hand in hand with our buyers, our supply chain team to meet the demand and get us the product we need, and a big thanks to all of our national branded partners. We appreciate everything they've done. So Robby, why don't we let John start by talking about the outstanding performance we saw with Shipt, and then we'll come back and talk about digital profitability over time. And Robby, I just -- I'd finish up by going back to our strategy and using our stores as fulfillment hubs. And as we talked about our performance with digital, although the 141% growth rate is a stunning number, the number I really focus on is the same-day fulfillment, which grew by 278%, and that was all fulfilled by our stores. And if you actually look at a different metric, if we think about store-fulfilled comps during the first quarter, while we grew by 10.8% overall, if I look at that store-fulfilled comp number, that increased by over 9%. It means our stores are driving tremendous productivity, and they are the center of our strategy. And that's a number you'll hear us talk about more and more and more. \n So when we talk about store comps during the quarter, they look relatively low at just under 1%. But those stores actually drove over 9% comp growth during the quarter. And from an economic standpoint, we know over time, that's a really healthy and profitable transaction. So the stores did tremendous work during this quarter. And America turned to Target stores because they trust our service and our reliability and rewarded us with a store-fulfilled comp of over 9%. Oliver, why don't I start. And when I think about the quarter and some of the learning from the quarter, I'll have to go back with the importance of stores. And at the start of the pandemic, and we've talked about the different chapters, America turned to Target stores. And that's where we saw the uptick. That's where they came for household essentials, they stocked up on food and beverage. So when America was asked to shelter in place, they started to use our same-day fulfillment channels and were picking up in store and driving to our parking lots to use Drive-Up or using a Shipt shopper. \n But when I think about the quarter, it just reinforces to me the important role that stores play, both our traditional stores and even our smaller formats in urban markets. There's a number of e-mails I've received from guests in New York City and Boston and Chicago thanking us for that small format in their neighborhood that supplied all of their household and family needs during the pandemic. So my highlight and takeaway is stores are vitally important, and stores will continue to play a really important role to America as we go forward. So to John's point, automation will be important, Oliver. But as we sit here today, I think the most important thing to focus on is execution. And I think in this environment, we've earned the trust of American shoppers with great execution and our commitment to providing a safe shopping environment. And you'll see us continue to commit to safety and trust as we go forward over the balance of the year. \n So operator, that concludes our call today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. I hope you stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to the day when we can be meeting again face to face. So thank you."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. As you've already heard several times today, this quarter was far different than anyone would have modeled 90 days ago across multiple dimensions of our business. And like everyone else, for the last few months, our team has been deeply involved in the details, helping our business to effectively respond to the rapid changes in both our category and channel performance. \n But when you pull back from all the detail and day-to-day volatility, a couple of themes have clearly emerged. First, this environment has provided an accelerated real-time test of the investments we've been making in our longer-term strategy and operational model. And our business has performed better under these conditions than we would have ever imagined. \n Second and also important, this environment provides a vivid illustration of why quarterly profitability isn't always the best indicator of long-term potential. If you only looked at our first quarter EPS, which was down more than 60% compared with last year, you might be tempted to say that our performance was disappointing and that our long-term prospects have been getting weaker, but I'd strongly assert the opposite. Because of what our team has been able to accomplish and deliver for our guests, I believe our long-term prospects have gotten stronger over the last 90 days. Put another way, I wouldn't trade Target's future prospects for anyone else's in the marketplace. \n With that context, I will run through our financial results, providing our longer-term perspective before I turn the call back over to Brian. Overall, our first quarter comparable sales grew 10.8%, reflecting some of the strongest growth our business has ever seen. Total sales grew 11.3%, about 50 basis points faster due to sales from our nonmature stores. Among the drivers of our comp growth, comparable traffic was down 1.5% and average ticket was up 12.5% as guests consolidated their shopping trips into fewer bigger baskets. Among channels, store comparable sales increased 0.9% while digital comp sales grew 141%. As Brian and John highlighted earlier, quarterly averages for category and channel growth don't show the volatility we saw throughout the quarter. \n On the gross margin line, our business delivered a rate of 25.1%, down about 450 basis points from a year ago. Obviously, this is well below what you would expect in normal times, but these times have been anything but normal. There are 3 major drivers of this quarter's decline. First, we incurred hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental costs, including inventory impairments resulting from the severe slowdown in apparel sales. For context on these costs, it's important to note that prior to the first quarter, comp sales in Apparel & Accessories had been growing more than 5% but quickly decelerated to more than a 20% decline in the first quarter. Put another way, if those prior trends in Apparel & Accessories had continued, first quarter sales in that category would have been more than $800 million higher. \n A second source of pressure was category sales mix as we saw wide divergence in sales trends across our business. Our 3 lowest-margin categories, Hardlines, essentials and Food and Beverage, each saw first quarter comp increases in the high teens or higher. In contrast, our 2 highest-margin categories, Home and apparel, saw slower trends with Home in the high single digits and the Apparel decline of more than 20%. Altogether, category sales mix accounted for more than 150 basis points of this quarter's gross margin decline. \n The third major factor was digital fulfillment and supply chain costs as digital penetration more than doubled compared with last year, driving nearly 10 percentage points of our sales growth. As John mentioned earlier, we were already planning to reach this level of digital sales penetration over time, but this crisis has rapidly increased the pace of digital adoption among U.S. consumers. But importantly, given the outstanding performance of our team and operations in the face of this unprecedented surge in volume, we've continued to see high levels of guest satisfaction with our digital fulfillment, which is a positive leading indicator of guest loyalty, engagement and market share over time. \n Moving down to the SG&A expense line. Our first quarter rate was 20.7%, about 10 basis points lower than a year ago. As always, expense performance was driven by many factors, but there were 2 primary drivers of our year-over-year performance. The first was the incremental costs we've incurred as we responded to the crisis, including higher pay for hourly team members in our stores, extended paid leave and backup daycare provisions across our team and enhanced cleaning routines and other investments to protect the health of our guests and our team across the country. Against these higher costs, we realized a meaningful rate benefit from sales leverage given our unusually strong comparable sales growth in the quarter. \n On the D&A line, first quarter dollars were approximately flat to last year, resulting in about 40 basis points of rate improvement on higher sales. Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate of 2.4% was about 400 basis points lower than last year. On the interest expense line, we saw a slight decline in dollars, reflecting the benefit of lower average floating benchmark interest rates. Income tax expense declined about 80% compared with last year, driven primarily by the decline in our profitability. \n On the adjusted EPS line, we earned $0.59 in the first quarter, more than 60% lower than last year. GAAP EPS was about $0.03 lower at $0.56, reflecting the loss on our investments in Casper Sleep. \n Now I want to turn to cash flow and capital deployment. But first, I want to outline a number of actions we've taken this quarter in response to the environment. The first change, as John already outlined, was a reduction in the number of remodels and new stores we are planning for 2020. John already made it clear that this decision was based on removing distractions for our team, combined with the impact of other factors in the external environment. Like John, I want to emphasize that we haven't changed our view of the ultimate long-term value of these projects nor was the decision to slow down these projects driven by the desire to preserve capital. \n Regardless, this change in our plans will affect our anticipated CapEx for the year. At this point, we expect that our 2020 CapEx will be $3 billion or lower in contrast to our prior expectation of about $3.5 billion. At this point, things are too uncertain to provide a view of our plans for future year remodels, new stores and overall CapEx, but we expect to provide more clarity over time. \n The second change occurred in March when we announced the suspension of our share repurchase program in light of the high level of uncertainty in the current environment. This decision was prudent and consistent with our long-term capital deployment priorities in which share repurchase only occurs when we have excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings after we fully invested in our business and supported our dividend. \n And finally, during the first quarter, we issued $2.5 billion in new debt and added another $900 million revolving credit facility to supplement our existing $2.5 billion revolver. We took these actions out of an abundance of caution given the high degree of uncertainty in the environment and the possibility of a very challenging external environment throughout this year. As we've pointed out many times, we entered this crisis in a very strong position with ample cash on our balance sheet, strong credit ratings and a business model position to generate robust cash flow across a wide range of conditions. Given that strength, our modeling indicated we have a very wide range of potential economic scenarios in which we'd have sufficient liquidity even without the extra capacity resulting from these actions. Even so, given that we were able to issue new debt at historically low rates, we view these decisions as prudent, affordable insurance, giving us an extra layer of cushion to accommodate even more extreme downside scenarios should they arise. \n Turning to cash flow. We actually saw really strong performance in the first quarter as operating cash flow grew nearly $1 billion compared with last year. This performance reflected a number of factors, including an increase in payables and a decrease in inventory compared with last year, along with various timing issues, which more than offset the decline in earnings we experienced this year. \n Regarding our inventory position, while the year-over-year decline looks good on the cash flow statement, it reflects the lack of availability and elevated out-of-stocks we're seeing in multiple categories. As such, we have elected to invest more cash and ended the quarter with a higher level of inventory in those categories if it had been available. \n In terms of deployment of cash, our first quarter CapEx was about $750 million, nearly $100 million higher than last year. In addition, we paid dividends of $332 million to our shareholders and returned another $609 million through share repurchases prior to the suspension of the program in March. \n And finally, on the ROIC line, our business delivered a trailing 12-month after-tax return of 13.4% in the first quarter, down from 14.3% a year ago. Obviously, this decline reflects the dramatic decline in our profitability during the quarter, which does not reflect where we expect our business to perform over time. However, I will quickly add that even though this performance is down from a year ago, a 13.4% after-tax return is still quite strong on an absolute basis and favorable compared to results across a wide array of companies in retail and beyond. \n So now I want to leave you with a couple of important thoughts. First, our long-term priorities for capital deployment have not wavered. At the top of the list is our goal to invest fully in all projects that support our long-term strategic and financial goals. Second, we support the dividend with a goal to build on our long-term record in which we've paid a dividend every quarter in our history as a public company. And finally, over time, we expect to return any excess cash beyond those first 2 uses through share repurchases within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. These capital deployment priorities have served the long-term interest of both our business and our shareholders over many decades. It is our investments in our stores, in our fulfillment capabilities, in our assortment and in our team that have positioned us to succeed now and will power our future. \n The other important point pertains to the resilience of our business combined with the strength of our balance sheet. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I believe that our long-term prospects have only gotten stronger as our operations and team have reliably served guests during this crisis. Because of our multi-category portfolio, we were able to quickly pivot as guest demand evolved from stocking up on food and essentials to focusing on home and electronics as they sheltered in place until we saw a broad-based acceleration across multiple categories toward the end of the quarter. Because of our curated digital assortment and store-based fulfillment model, our operations and team adjusted seamlessly as guests increasingly chose digital fulfillment, allowing digital sales to account for nearly 10 percentage points of our first quarter comparable sales growth. And because of the strength of our business, we could afford to make hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental investments in team member wages and benefits, along with actions to enhance the safety of both our guests and our team. \n As we look ahead, we are focused on continuing to deliver for our guests and our team throughout the crisis while preparing to emerge strong and ready to play offense when our economy recovers. And we think the opportunities when that happens will be compelling. Unfortunately, this crisis will cause a lot of dislocation in multiple parts of the economy, including retail. As a result, we expect to have many potential opportunities to invest, including possibilities in real estate, brands, capabilities and obviously, in our existing strategic initiatives. So while we always monitor our short-term financial results and focus on strong execution, I think it's more important than ever for us to maintain a laser focus on the long term when I expect we could have unprecedented opportunities to create value for all of our stakeholders. \n Now like Brian and John, I want to pause and thank everyone on the team for their endless energy, alignment with our values and for taking care of each other. It's said that you don't really know how strong your team is until it goes through challenging times, and I couldn't be more proud to see how our team has risen to the challenge by serving our guests and our communities over the past few months. \n Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian? All right. Chris, can you hear me? All right. I had a great answer that you heard none of, so I'll try to do my best paraphrasing again. To decompose margin a little bit more, if I had to dimensionalize it into the 3 biggest drivers of what we saw in Q1, the first would be a set of merchandising actions that we took throughout the quarter. And the biggest of which, to your question, was the inventory write-downs and adjustments that we made, especially in apparel given the deceleration we saw in apparel throughout the better part of Q1. That's probably the biggest factor. \n And then as I mentioned in my remarks, category mix at about 150 basis points would be the second biggest factor. And then the third would be the pressure from supply chain in general, and there's a couple of things there. A portion of our investment in the team shows up in margin because supply chain labor shows up in margin. And then the mix shift to digital is there as well. \n But I think it's worth pausing for a moment on that mix shift to digital and the rate pressure that comes with that because I want to spend a second on how I think about digital economics because I think there's real risk in over-rotating on the profit rate headwind that shows up there for a couple of reasons. The first is for the vast majority of those digital transactions and especially the ones where the guest's taking advantage of our same-day services, the sales dollars, the market share dollars and the variable profit dollars from those sales are definitely a good thing. And second, and this is most important, the economics of a digital transaction, as I've said before, are so much bigger than just the single transaction. When we see guests engage with more of our fulfillment choices, they become stronger customers of Target and we build relevance with them in total, and that's where the economics of digital get most powerful. \n As I referenced in the financial community meeting discussions a few months ago, when we see a guest use Drive-Up for the first time, they spend more at Target in total and even more in store than they did previously. And so there's a powerful accelerant of guests becoming stronger users of all of our services. And we had 2 million guests use Drive-Up for the first time in this quarter, and so the long run prospects of that digital growth in terms of what it means with relevancy to our guests, I think, are very powerful. Yes. What I'd say, Chris, is this is what our teams do each and every day. And so we react to changing trends and take inventory actions appropriate. And I'd give just a huge hats off to our merchandising teams who have worked through the volatility and sales trends throughout the quarter, both the softness in apparel that leads to some of the write-downs we're talking about in Q1, but in every category that's seen trends deviate from history in such meaningful ways. And I can maybe just chime in on the prospects for increased efficiency over time. We've seen across wherever we've had growth, whether it's the growth in Drive-Up over the last several years, Order Pickup, volume helps us. And with volume, we can bring efficiency. And when it comes to digital, as John mentioned, we've been investing in planning and capability to support this volume. We just thought it would be 3 years from now. And so we've seen an acceleration for what we would have expected to take 3 years that's now happened in a matter of weeks. And so as we get the chance to optimize some of our operations against that volume, we should be able to drive increased efficiency over time. \n But the thing I'm most excited about on the digital front that we've touched on a little bit already is just the opportunity we have to capture relevance with guests as their shopping habits change. We know over the long run, when guest behavior changes -- and that's why a family with a new baby in the house is such an important guest milestone for us, where we want to show up because that's when shopping habits can change. Back to college, the first time you move into your new home, those milestones matter to us as a retailer and always have because that's when shopping habits can change. And I think across America right now, we're seeing an acceleration in the change of shopping habits as it relates to digital. And the way we've shown up with 280-plus percent growth in digital in April means we're capturing a lot of that mind share and those new routines as they're forming."

        "content": "John Hulbert: Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to Target's 2022 Financial Community Meeting. I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting remotely this morning. And for the first time in 3 years, it's great to welcome everyone who's here with us in person in New York. \n Before I turn it over to Brian, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most comparable -- directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to begin the meeting. \n [Presentation] \nBrian Cornell: Good morning. It's great to be back here in New York for our first live event since the start of the pandemic. I can tell you, our entire team has been looking forward to seeing you in person. It's been a long couple of years. \n But I also have to acknowledge the continued uncertainty that surrounds our world, which is only being magnified by the growing conflict between Russia and the citizens of Ukraine. It serves as another reminder of our continued need to support our teams, our guests, our communities as we all navigate these very challenging times. \n It's been 5 years since I stood in front of many of you, the head of then a $70 billion company. I was a little nervous as I laid out a bold new company strategy. Today, I stand in front of you as the head of a $106 billion growth company with a long list of proof points that our strategy is working. \n We've delivered 19 consecutive quarters of comp growth: 11 quarters of comp growth before the pandemic, 8 quarters of comp growth since the pandemic. We've grown because we've accelerated our investments in our team and in our strategy. We've accelerated our growth because our team stepped up in heroic ways, meeting the explosive demands that materialized with the pandemic. \n 5 years ago, we had 1,800 stores. I announced the plan to add stores and upgrade the stores we had. And I saw jaws drop and our stock price dive for a while. At that time, retail was about closing stores, not opening them. Many of you questioned our approach. Now 5 years later, we have almost 2,000 stores, and we're still remodeling and building new stores. \n We also know the way we run our stores is the secret to growing digital sales. Yes, the way we run our stores is the secret to why digital is now 19% of sales. So as we look at the next 5 years, we're going to continue to build on our strengths. We have a culture, we have the connections, and we care. We care about delighting our guests. We care about delivering value to our stakeholders. And as you see in our fourth quarter results, we're accelerating our investment in what's next as we continue to deliver what's now. \n For Q4, our comp sales were up nearly 9%. We achieved standout results relative to the market. We achieved growth on top of last year's all-time record growth. Our full year comp was up a remarkable 12.7%. In the last 2 years, we've grown by more than 35%. That's more than $27 billion. That figure alone would place the company in the top quarter of the Fortune 500. \n And we're seeing the benefits of stores as hubs. Growth was split nearly 50-50 between stores and digital dollars. Over this time frame, we grew 2021 traffic by more than 12% on top of nearly 4% in 2020. And we posted 2021 after-tax return on invested capital of 33%. We achieved all this growth while protecting consumers from dramatic cost of good inflation, delivering adjusted EPS that is 44% higher than last year and more than double where it was in 2019, and funding all of our ambitious strategic investments completely. \n Our Q4 results show we're taking our strategy forward to the next level with speed, with efficiency and with relevance, with care. Over the next 75 minutes, we'll show you how we're investing in opportunities for big wins. We've added Ulta Beauty to our stores. So far, our sales per square foot are strong. Guest engagement is impressive. We see the scale of opportunities as being even more impressive. We'll show you how we translated a massive influx of insights from new guests and loyal guests who are engaging even more. You'll see how we're accelerating our capabilities in personalization, creating an always-on, inspiring guest experience and driving unparalleled value to our partners with a fast-growing revenue stream for our business through Roundel. \n We'll show you how we're adding capacity, efficiency and innovation across stores and supply chain operations, driving the next phase of stores as hubs. We'll show you how we're growing by increasing our multi-category assortment. We'll show you how we're making incredible progress in a category like Food & Beverage. And above all, we'll show you how we're growing by keeping investments in our team constant. We believe our constant investment creates that critical connection between social and environmental sustainability. \n ESG is a critical part of our Target Forward strategy. So yes, we're going to keep growing in 2022. And knowing this, we've upgraded our long-term financial algorithm. Michael will lay that out later this morning. \n We are a bigger, stronger company now. We're growing on a bigger base than ever, and we recognize the power of 'and'. We have a slate of focused initiatives, and they work together in unison. We have a connection to our guests, and we have relevance to their lives. We have physical/digital experiences and the only at Target touches. We have a multi-category portfolio and a differentiated approach to curating owned and national brands. We have scale in same-day services and the pathway for more digital growth, thanks to the synchronized operation of stores, fulfillment centers, flow centers, sortation centers and Shipt. \n We have the commitment for Target forward, and we can use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet. We'll serve our guests through challenging times, and we'll find terrific opportunities for growth. We definitely have the power of 'and'. We know today's consumers are facing a series of follow hardships from the pandemic. We see higher prices across the country. We see supply chain constraints that are steadily working themselves out but will likely take more time, both of which are made more uncertain by the crisis in Ukraine. \n And we see people reevaluating how they think about work. Millions of people are searching for careers that have meaning and purpose, and they are turning to companies like Target for opportunities. As you'll hear today, we're walking our stakeholders through these challenges. We have the global scale to keep the products people want and need moving through our pipeline. We have the value levers, multi-category assortment and multichannel shopping experience. And we allow our guests to consolidate trips, get more done in one store and experience a little bit of affordable luxury for their families, especially in this inflationary economy. \n Above all, we built a culture that cares. Our teams understand the way to grow and win together is to care. They care about each other. They care about our guests. They care about our communities. They care about the millions of families we touch each and every day. As I look at the future of Target, I increasingly see care separating us from the industry. So before we dive in a corporate strategy and operational details, I want to tie some of these things together. I want to show you how our potential, our culture, our connection and caring tie into a business model that will deliver even more personalized, even more equitable, even more sustainable growth in the future. \n For a concrete example, look no further than the announcement we made yesterday to invest up to $300 million to set a new starting wage and to expand access to health care benefits to more team members and their families. 2 years ago, we raised our starting minimum wage to an industry-leading $15 per hour. Now we're setting new starting wage ranges of $15 to $24 per hour, positioning Target as a wage leader in every market where we operate. \n We'll also provide broader, faster access to health care for hourly team members, making nearly 20% of our team newly eligible for benefits and reducing the waiting period for all hourly store team members to enroll in Target medical plans. You can count on us to keep leading with investments like these. But to really appreciate where we're headed as a company, I want you to know not just what we're investing in, but whom. \n I'm thinking of Jen Mayer, Store Director of T1235 in Hudson, Wisconsin. Jen started as an intern 26 years ago. Since then, she's gone on to lead stores for Target in Iowa, Missouri, Indiana and Minnesota. In the 2 years since she moved to Hudson, store sales have increased by 30%. You'll hear about chain-wide figures like that from John, and Jen's store is a proof point to that trend. Shortly after she started in Hudson, Jen oversaw the introduction of Drive Up right at the start of the pandemic. And in 2 short years, our stores rocketed up to the top 75 for Drive Up. \n So the store performance is strong, but that's not what caught my attention. Instead, it was a speech by one of Jen's team members, a 27-year-old named Lindsay, one of the thousands of team members who joined Target in the pandemic. In front of a Black Tie Gala last fall, Lindsay related how she was devastated after losing her previous job during the COVID lockdowns of 2020. Here's what she had to say. \nUnknown Attendee: It is a privilege and honor to tell you how I became a Target team member. My Target story is one of inclusion and acceptances. As we know, when the pandemic happened and businesses and people were affected everywhere, I sat home crying about being laid off from my job and needing a schedule. I wanted it and needed to work. I like to shop by Target, so I thought, you know, that would be a good place to work. \n That's when all on my own, I updated my resume and sent my application in. I didn't need my mom's help this time. She wasn't in my interview either like she was in the past. 45 minutes into the interview and telling them that I had to be honest, I have autism. They said, \"Thank you for sharing. Welcome to Target.\" \nBrian Cornell: No one who knows Jen or her team would be the least bit surprise that they hired Lindsay on the spot or that Lindsay has had a great developmental experience in the store, is doing well and appreciates her extended Target family. Jen speaks for the company when she says, it's important to give everyone opportunities. In her 20 years as a store director, she's moved hundreds of team members from part-time to full-time. She's developed and promoted dozens of team members to leadership positions. She's helped them cope with trauma, overcome disparities, build skills and save for the future. \n She speaks boldly for our culture when she says, \"I ask myself, what would I want someone to do for me? And then I tried to do that times 10.\" This is the kind of question we ask ourselves to the company all the time: what can we do with our resources, with our strategy and plans, with our team and culture to serve the world around us in a bigger or beneficial way? \n So as I hand off to our team, I'll ask you to keep that story in mind. Jen Meyer will be the first to tell you, we're just getting started, that you can't equate accelerated returns with exhausted ones. Her store with those strong results hasn't even been touched by a remodel. Starting in April, T1235 will get an Ulta Beauty and a Disney store, will significantly increase the size of her grocery footprint and add a dedicated entrance for Drive Up and Order Pick Up given the volume of same-day services. And the growth from this remodel will spur Jen's store even higher. It will combine with thousands of comparable examples countrywide to bring more joy, more equity and opportunity and even more growth in both financial and societal terms to our stakeholders here and around the world. \n Christina? \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian. This morning, I'm eager to give you a peek behind the curtain to answer the question, what's next for Target? And the short answer is a lot. I'd like to share with you a deeper look into the growth framework we use to drive our strategies forward. With a fortified foundation and the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests, we're continuing to build what's working strategically while making smart choices to launch new initiatives. \n While I plan to spend most of my time today sharing our specific strategies and the lens through which we view them. Let's first acknowledge what enables the execution of these strategies in the first place: our team, our operations and technology. The investments we've made in these areas will empower everything we'll share today. In fact, they're increasingly becoming differentiated growth drivers in their own rights, and they propel our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. And at the center of that purpose, you see our guests. Everything we do should be rooted in a deep understanding of what our guests want, along with empathy to understand what they need. \n Our culture to care, grow and win together, coupled with our core values of inclusivity, connection and drive, support our purpose. Without them, our purpose statement is just words on the page. It's only when we're aligned in who we are, what we care about and how we drive forward together that our purpose comes to life. \n Here's a recent example. One of our guests, Nicholas, recently lost his sister to cancer. One of his family's most prized possessions was a photo his sister in an opal-housed picture frame that she gave to him before she passed. One day, the frame fell and shattered. Unable to find a replacement, Nicholas reached out to us with a plea for help. The frame, unfortunately, was no longer in production. But the owned brand team tracked down 2 remaining frames, which they sent to Nicholas and his wife, complete with handwritten notes of sympathy and care from the Target team. \n Nicholas shared with the team, \"I know it's just a frame, but there's a lot of meaning behind it. What you did may seem small, but it represents so much more.\" This is just one example of how our team continuously shows up, living out our values and putting care first. I am so grateful for their unwavering commitment to our guests, the communities they serve and each other, all in service of our purpose. \n So now let's go deeper into each of our 6 strategic pillars, distinct but interwoven aspects of how we intend to grow. They represent core ideas to create forward motion for our business and help define the sum of the parts that is uniquely Target. Let's begin with one of the most iconic differentiators at Target, our brands. Through our careful balance of exclusive owned brands and industry-leading national brands, Target differentiates by curating a unique assortment, driving preference in a crowded retail landscape. We built guest affinity through our flagship brands like Good & Gather, All in Motion, Cat & Jack and Threshold. We've also continued to innovate with new brands such as Brightroom, Target's first dedicated storage and home organization owned brand; and Kindful, our first pet food brand with premium ingredients and no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. \n Through our world-class design and sourcing functions, we are able to develop and produce products adding incredible quality and value, always a focus for our guests, but never more so than in an inflationary environment. To illustrate the scale of our owned brands, in 2021 alone, Target sold more than 330 million units in Cat & Jack, equating to nearly 7 items for every child in the United States under the age of 11. And even though these brands are already big, they're still growing. In fact, Target's owned brands grew 18% in 2021. And at more than $30 billion, our owned brand sales alone now rival the size of some Fortune 100 companies. \n But as we've said before, it isn't about owned or national brands. The harmony created between them is part of what makes Target unique. Our recent progress in denim serves as a perfect example. Years ago, we recognized a vast opportunity to elevate denim's role at Target, stemming from considerable guests and market research. So when Universal Thread and Goodfellow launched, both featured extensive new denim offerings, including a variety of styles and inclusive sizing, all at sharp price points. The guest reaction was to the quality and value was fantastic. \n We further rounded out the assortment by deepening our partnership with Levi's, which continues to grow. All told, the interplay between our owned and national brands has reinvigorated this category, bringing us from a retailer that sold denim to a denim destination, having grown sales in this category by more than $150 million since 2019. \n And Levi's isn't the only growing partnership at Target. We're also deepening our relationship with leading national brand partners like Disney, Apple and Ulta Beauty. Brian touched on the strong results we're seeing with our first 100 Ulta Beauty at Target stores. We entered this partnership knowing our guests were looking for prestige beauty brands and industry-leading expertise, and that's exactly what these new shops are delivering. \n In stores where we've added an Ulta Beauty experience, guests are buying incremental items from the Ulta Beauty assortment while continuing to shop the beauty brands they loved at Target for years. In fact, these new spaces average more than 2x the productivity of the rest of the store, and the growth is proving to be incremental. Specifically, in stores that have added an Ulta Beauty section, we're seeing a mid-teens lift across total Beauty and productivity lifts in complementary categories as well. With these incredible results, we remain committed to operating at least 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations over time with plans to add more than 250 new locations in 2022. \n At Target, we pride ourselves on the level of service and shopping experience we provide. As John and Mark will share in more detail, we made meaningful investments and progress in the store shopping experience over the past several years. So I'll focus on our opportunity to grow our in-store services. \n Target has long been a destination and escape, largely because of the differentiated experience we provide. In-store services are one more way we can make life easier for our guests, helping them to accomplish more in a single trip to their local store. Years ago, we began our partnership with CVS Health to provide pharmacy services in our stores, and they continue to deliver exceptional care and expertise today. This not only benefits our guests who fulfill their prescriptions in our stores but also consolidates another trip, simplifying their lives. \n Similarly, we provide convenient, well-established optical services, which we have at more than 500 of our stores and growing. Yet we still have an opportunity to do more. Let me share an example of a recent pilot we plan to scale. In 2021, Target began testing ear piercing at several Minneapolis-based stores. Our research found that guests were looking for a reliable, safe and convenient place to get their families' ears pierced. So we created a joyful and differentiated experience, making us the first-and-only national retailer to offer ear piercings performed by a licensed nurse. This service helps us connect and celebrate a major milestone with often younger guests, creating lasting affinity for our brand. \n Given the success of the pilot, we recently expanded the rollout to nearly 200 stores with plans to meaningfully increase that number by the end of 2022. This is a fantastic example of what happens when we listen to our guests, deeply research the market opportunities and create a differentiated solution. \n Another growth pillar is our focus on affordability as value remains among the biggest loyalty builders in retail. Our goal is to deliver unbeatable value by providing affordability across every category every day. After all, we established our Expect More, Pay Less promise decades ago, and we're continuously evolving what it means to deliver great value. \n Given that the U.S. economy is experiencing the highest inflation rate in decades, the American consumer is becoming increasingly price-conscious. This is why we believe our comprehensive view of affordability, which focuses on price but encompasses so much more, sets Target apart from our competitors, driving deepened engagement and growing loyalty. Our guests tell us that affordability begins with price, but also includes proximity, accessibility and assortment choices that satisfy any budget. \n It also means receiving valuable benefits like those we offer through Target Circle, including exclusive promotions and deals, 1% earnings to redeem on future purchases and the ability to help direct Target's charitable-giving to the causes our guests care most about; and the industry-leading benefits we offer with our RedCard holders, including 5% of every transaction, free shipping on Target.com and no annual membership fees. Over the years, RedCard guests have saved more than $9 billion on their purchases, including more than $1 billion in 2021 alone. \n Now I'd like to share a bit more about 2 emerging growth pillars in our framework. While they represent more nascent opportunities, they are positioned to spur incremental growth on top of our existing strategies. The first is our focus on relevance, something we've long worked to maintain and grow with every guest interaction. Brian shared the compelling opportunity we have to better harness and apply the power of guest insights. Through this opportunity, we can optimize our assortment, more effectively make offers to our guests and, most importantly, personalize our interactions with them. We've long known the joint value we can create for our vendors, our guests and Target by connecting guests to the products they want and need. \n But as we continue to deepen our relationship with the guests, our ability to refine and elevate this value is extraordinary and will continue to drive outsized growth over the next several years through the likes of Target Circle, Roundel and Target Plus. Carol will provide more detail on these rapidly growing platforms in a moment. \n Finally, I want to highlight Target Forward, the newest chapter in a long history of strong corporate responsibility at our company. At a time when the American consumer is becoming increasingly focused on not just what they buy but also where and how the product was made, how its production impacts the world and those who produced it, and how companies function as citizens of a global community, we are proud of our bold commitments to better people in the planet with every choice we make. \n As we grow and continue to develop our new owned brands, our Target Forward commitment is to design and elevate circular, sustainable brands. Of course, these brands will begin with a focus on our guests but also consider the impact to the world. We aspire for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future by 2040. \n Additionally, our teams will continue designing to eliminate waste, using materials that are regenerative, recycled or sourced sustainably to create products that are more durable, easily repaired or recyclable as well. Beyond our sustainability efforts, our aspirations to accelerate opportunity equity are equally pivotal. While we still have far to go, Target's Reach Committee is encouraged to be leading the industry with progress against virtually every goal we have set forth. We'll continue to share specific progress over time, but I want to highlight a few examples with you today. \n The first is in our Beauty business, where we have increased our black-owned or founded brands by 65% since 2020, and are now leading the industry with more than 70 black-owned and founded brands. Some of these entrepreneurs launched through Target's accelerator programs designed to quickly scale brands at Target.  \n Entrepreneur Cora Miller of the Black-owned Hair Care business, Young King Hair Care, went through our 2020 Target Takeout program and subsequently launched in 365 Target stores. Given the immediate success and reaction from our guests, we now have plans to expand this line into significantly more stores in 2022. Cora is among a group of fewer than 100 Black female entrepreneurs to raise more than $1 million in venture funds ever. We want Cora's story to become the rule, not the exception. We'll continue to elevate entrepreneurs like her through Accelerator programs, including the recently launched Forward Founders program, which equips historically under-resourced entrepreneurs to build their businesses and gain access to industry-leading retail resources and partnerships.  \n When more than half of our first cohort comprised of Black entrepreneurs, we aim to provide a launching point for many new and emerging Black-owned businesses. If we've proven anything over the last few years, it's that Target's a growth company. Even though we're now more than a $100 billion business, the opportunities for growth are immense. \n We have created momentum through unique and innovative strategies, many of which began long before the onset of the pandemic. And because of our durable, flexible business model, we have proven we can adapt to any environment. We'll continue to play offense and accelerate these strategies while listening to the ever-changing wants and needs of our guests to ensure our playbook is a direct reflection of what they have come to expect from Target. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Cara, who will provide more color on some of our powerful growth strategies. \nCara Sylvester: Hello, everyone. I'm excited to be here to share a view of Target's growth through our guest' eyes, because as Christina shared, everything we do should be rooted in a deep understanding of what our guests want, along with the empathy to understand what they need and how those needs continue to evolve. In the next few minutes, I want to show you how our commitment to relevance has positioned Target to deliver the most personalized omnichannel experience in retail. \n In my first year as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer, I've had the privilege of sharing Target's story in many virtual firesides, roundtables and interviews. And the common thread, when I think about all of those times, is that people always ask me how Target stays 3 steps ahead with our guests in these rapidly changing times. And while I am not a huge fan of giving away all the keys to success, I always point to our culture of care and our core value of inclusivity that have us listening and learning from our guests deeply and continuously. \n When our insights team talks with guests, we don't just ask them questions about Target and their experiences shopping with us. Guests share their hopes with us, their fears and their dreams. They share simply what's going on in their lives. Through these ongoing check-ins, every area of our enterprise has a view of the holistic human experience lived by our guests during the pandemic and what that might mean for Target in the future. \n We also know from brand research what matters most to guests when they shop and connect with us. Ease and affordability are essential, but our guests are looking for more, too: quality and value, community and connection, inclusivity and feeling seen, what Brian calls the power of 'and'. And what gets me really excited is how we're delivering loud and proud on these personal guest values at scale. \n Target's digital experience, which we have been investing in for years, plays a key role here as a gateway to our guests and a huge growth driver for us. Our digital business has nearly tripled in the last 2 years and in 2021 delivered a 20% comp on top of a 145% comp the year prior. Then there's 45% comp growth in digitally enabled same-day services on top of 235% last year. And our flagship Target app has moved from 30% of digital demand a little over 2 years ago to closing in on 70% today. \n But the biggest differentiator when you look at Target's digital experience, it is designed with guests at the center. We take the friction out so that guests can experience Target on their own terms, which means we are guest-obsessing at every touch point to stay a step ahead of evolving guest behaviors. For example, we're leaning into the love our guests have for our digitally led same-day services because that's sticking. Routines developed early in the pandemic are now part of their lives, things they cannot live without. But they look a little bit different today. \n So here's a guest who had a Drive Up border, our highest NPS service, but then she was drawn inside to discover something new. Then there's this guest who said, \"Can we just talk about the fact that you can go through Target with Starbucks at hand and then go through Ulta?\" These new kinds of Target runs and stock-ups reflect our guests' evolving needs and wants and a seamless omnichannel experience that delivers on them. \n Today, Target has 40 million guests in counting shopping across channels. And as you've heard us share before, omnichannel guests spend 4x as much as stores-only guests and even more compared to digital-only guests. Target can bring together insights across an omnichannel journey, from RedCard and registry, to digital and in-store, to our call centers and every step in between, which means we're getting a 360-degree view of the kind of guests that are driving so much growth. \n With these meaningful insights, we can make sure that Target Magic they love is even more relevant in their lives and the experience even more personalized. So you can imagine what this looks like. For one guest scrolling through the app, what she sees is curated especially for her. There's her favorite items and great deals on her go-to essentials for weeknight dinners. And because she told us she's a teacher, it really means something to her when she sees a Target Circle offer that makes her classroom supplies more affordable. \n She's getting ideas for what to pack in lunchboxes for her kids this week, too, maybe a little something from Good & Gather. And what's more, her app experience helps make life easier as someone who might need a shopping partner once in a while. That's our name for a new service that allows her husband to do the Target run while she's working, a service that is near and dear to my family's heart. So she checks out and later that afternoon, he picks up what's for dinner. \n Here's another kind of personalized guest journey that we're obsessing over. A guest is shopping for essentials when he sees a message from a banner ad about Clorox' Glad bags. He's purchased them before, but other brands, too. The headline benefits really resonate with him. So this time, he adds Glad to his cart. He checks out and drives up. Purchases like this one contributed to a 40% higher return on ad spend for Clorox and a 25% increase in customer retention over the duration of the campaign. \n Let me share the back story on this type of Target run. At the start of the pandemic, Clorox saw growth in guests buying their products for the first time, and they wanted to retain them. So they turn to our media company, Roundel, to measure guest values and behaviors. Using that research, Roundel developed a series of A/B tests, and Clorox used those key insights to optimize messaging and audience targeting. \n How we're leveraging media to know our guests better and create a more relevant and personalized experience for them is incredibly exciting, and so is this. From its humble beginnings in 2007 with just 5 team members and known as online vendor marketing, Roundel is now a 500-plus person strong fully integrated Target team, already delivering more than $1 billion in value for Target, and we expect that to grow to $2 billion over the next several years. \n To sum up Roundel, it's positioned for continued success because it's delivering on relevance and value. That's a win-win-win for Target, for our partners and for our guests. \n Now I'd say the same thing about Target Plus. Target Plus is different than other marketplaces. It's invite-only with vetted partners we have relationships with who are extending our aisles digitally. And because of our trusted and curated assortment, our guests aren't sifting through thousands of pages of results for the one thing that's going to bring them joy. In fact, Target Plus is so seamless on the things that matter, the ease of the experience, a relevant assortment and the benefits of RedCard and in-store returns, the majority of guests don't know they're shopping with marketplace. It feels like Target. It feels personal, and the love for marketplace is only growing. In 2021, Target Plus grew 75%. \n So let's take a look through our guests' eyes. In Target stores, our assortment of sunglasses features a curated set of options designed to meet the wants and needs of a broad set of families. For this guest, though, who's purchased Goodfellow shades to keep at home, at work, in his car, he's thinking about splurging for his upcoming vacation. The RayBan aviator he's looking for our online, and he's over the moon about the RedCard savings as he makes the purchase from our partner, Luxottica. And when he decides on a pair -- different pair that will frame his face even better, it's easy enough to stop by the store and let us handle the returns. \n With rich insights from omnichannel experiences, we're able to serve up even more deals that guests want, more suggestions of services they've never thought of, more ways to support brands and nonprofits close to their hearts. \n And that brings me to Target Circle, which I'm really excited to talk about. So here's a lesser engaged guests who joined Circle through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. She's able to seamlessly link her Ultimate Rewards account for Circle for all of the benefits. She's thrilled that she can now find her favorite skin care brand and her go-to mascara at her local Target store. And I want to pause here for just a second. \n Christina told us about how we're off to a great start with the Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops. But let's recognize how that partnership is translating to digital and loyalty with our guests. We're getting to know these guests in Circle, leading to more personalized experiences that are serving up the things they crave. And back to this guest, other things she may love, like Wild Fable. So in such a short time, someone who only shopped occasionally is now on the path to super fandom. \n Circle is a way for us to deeply understand our guests and have a 2-way connection with them. And in addition to the fact that in less than 3 years, it's become one of the biggest retail loyalty programs in the United States with 100 million members and growing. It's also one of the new ways we're creating relevance at scale with a strategic shift from mass promotional offers to personalized. \n During holiday, personalized offers showed an $8 to $10 lift in promotional basket size compared to mass offers and a conversion rate of 70% versus 40%. In addition to the personalized deals curated for them and the fact that they can vote and support local nonprofits important to them, I have to call out our guests' love for Target Circle Bonus. Our new gamification platform personalizes missions and rewards members. And it's already delivering big for our business, resulting in nearly $200 million in incremental sales in 2021. And as you're hearing repeatedly today, we're just getting started. \n So I've shared lots of examples about how we're meeting our guests' needs and wants throughout their omnichannel journey, but this one stands out as a point of pride. In the past, we've run a Black History Month campaign for the month of February. But now through our digital platforms, we've grown towards an always-on, deeply relevant approach. So Target guests can shop and support Black-owned founders and entrepreneurs all year round through Black Beyond Measure and Latino-owned brands, and women-owned brands, and Asian-owned brands, and so many more personalized and inclusive experiences where guests feel seen and heard every day. \n Here's one more. Let's take a look at a new spot from our brand campaign, What We Value Most Shouldn't Cost More.  \n [Presentation] \nCara Sylvester: There's a lot of good to see here. But it's not just what the guest sees, it's also about what's happening behind the scenes that makes all guests feel seen. We're partnering with diverse content creators in new ways from production crews to on-site catering in front of and behind the camera. Every part of the marketing ecosystem reflects our forward values. And this is so important. We are walking the walk in terms of our investments. By the end of the year, we're committing 5% of our annual media spend to Black-owned media partners and another 5% to Hispanic-owned media partners. Because equity, opportunity and inclusivity are core to who we are, they show up authentically in our omnichannel experience, and our guests are responding to that. \n This guest feels seen. In stationery, she feels a sense of belonging and inclusion when she holds a heartfelt message in Braille. And we brought him joy. Let's close with his journey. \n [Presentation] \nCara Sylvester: So no matter where you look in our omnichannel experience up at the Cat & Jack sign in store or online, the relevant connections we have with our guests are making a positive difference in their lives within our communities and for our business, and we're never going to stop. \n Now I'm delighted to introduce my friend and team member, John Mulligan. \nJohn Mulligan: Well, good morning, everybody. So I'm often asked how Target continues to operate within a challenging and volatile environment, putting growth on top of growth and building trust with our guests quarter after quarter. I could point to our agile supply chain, our hundreds of omnichannel stores, our industry-leading fulfillment capabilities and the operational algorithms that make it all work. But the real key to our continued growth is our global team and all the ways they're using our resources and operations to take care of our guests. \n In just the last 2 years, they've picked and packed 4x more items for same-day fulfillment, supported double-digit store traffic gains with a safe inspiring environment, opened over 60 new stores, remodeled hundreds more, and moved record levels of inventory to support our growing needs of our guests. Brian touched on how our Target team is showing up for each other and how that spirit of care starts here with our team and then extends to our guests and our communities. \n Our team is the connection across our business and the pulse of our operation, and I want to acknowledge their impact on how target shows up today and how we'll continue to deliver in the future. \n The power of our team is always visible in our stores, nearly 2,000 of them in neighborhoods across the country, serving as inspiring shopping destinations and local fulfillment hubs. Although the idea of leveraging stores to fulfill online orders is widely embraced across retail today, we are on our own when we introduced the concept 5 years ago. As a result, we're years ahead of others who just started using physical stores to meet digital demand. We know using stores as hubs would give guests more choice and convenience while giving our operation more flexibility and capacity for future growth. That was true prior to 2020 and could have not have been more essential since that time. \n Today, when our guests turn to Target, no matter how they choose to stop, those stores answer the call. Located just miles from most American homes, our stores handled more than 95% of the $100 billion plus in sales we did in 2021, including 12% more in-store traffic and most of our digital demand. Notably, more than half of those online sales were filled through our same-day services: Drive Up; Order Pick Up; and same-day delivery with Shipt. \n Our Chief Stores Officer, Mark Schindele, will share more shortly about how we'll keep investing in those services. They not only offer the quickest fulfillment at the lowest cost, their trip drivers that actually deepen guest engagement with Target. And on top of it all, they are the fastest-growing part of our business. This past year, they grew 45%, building on 235% growth in 2020, showing the continued guest appetite for fast and easy shopping. \n With digital fulfillment growing exponentially and in-store traffic continuing to rise, our stores are supporting more and more volume. In the last 5 years, the average store has added $15 million in sales, which means $40 million stores have become $55 million to $60 million stores and growing. And as our stores become more productive, they naturally gain efficiencies, including significant cost leverage and lower clearance markdown rates. So as they contribute more to our top line, they further protect the bottom line. \n We've said from the beginning that our stores have the capacity to support higher growth. That remains true today, even as average sales per store have risen 30% in just the last 2 years. But that enormous growth also means our operation is years ahead of where we had planned. So we're continuing to build upstream capacity we'll need over time. As we do, we're investing in ways that enable growth and move us toward our Target Forward sustainability commitments, from how we build and run our stores to the standards we hold for our vendor partners as well as how we will keep taking care of our team. We're continually strengthening an operation that supports a long future for Target and the world around us. \n Our investments in capacity start upstream and how we innovate within our supply chain to deliver on the growing need for inventory in our stores. Before last year, we hadn't added a new regional distribution center in over a decade, even as our total sales grew 40% over that same time period. Rather than add buildings, we grew by investing in automation, robotics and process design to improve the efficiency of our existing sites. Of course, we'll always keep investing to make our buildings more efficient. But with an additional $27 billion in sales over the last 2 years, we can't rely on that alone. It's time to expand our network. \n Last summer, we opened 2 new distribution facilities: 1 in New Jersey and 1 in Chicago. Today, we have 4 more currently in development that will open over the next few years with plans for several more to follow. Lighting up new buildings adds tremendous capacity to our supply chain network in support of our stores and will position Target to handle many more years of growth. \n As we continue investing upstream from our stores, we're also innovating downstream with sortation centers to accelerate our last-mile capabilities. These centers help us further scale our stores as hub strategy and create room for future growth. The first of these facilities, located not far from our headquarters in Minneapolis, has been up and running for just over a year. Before it opened, our store teams would fulfill online orders and palletize the packages in the backroom, waiting for 1  daily pickup from our carrier partners. Now Target trucks collect those packages at our 40-plus Twin City stores throughout the day, keeping orders moving, while giving stores more room to fill even more. \n The packages arrive at the sortation center, where they're organized by ZIP Code, and allocated to partners for direct delivery. Last spring, we integrated Shipt's last-mile delivery capabilities into the operation. Shipt drivers pick up a batch of orders sorted by neighborhood to make fast and efficient deliveries to our guests. Even during peak season, when most orders had a standard 2-day promise, these packages were delivered in just over a day on average. At the same time, the average unit fulfillment cost dropped by nearly 1/3, and that's before we've added automation that will make these buildings more productive in the future. \n Our Minneapolis pilot shows how sortation centers will make stores even more efficient as fulfillment hubs and allow us to roll out a next-day delivery capability at scale. We started to expand this concept into other densely populated markets. By the end of next month, we'll have 5 more centers up and running from Dallas to Philadelphia with another 5 planned in additional metro areas later this year. \n This capability isn't something we built overnight. It's the result of many strategic decisions we've made over time, working together in a model that's unique to Target. It works hand in glove with our stores-as-hub strategy. It leans on technology we acquired and further developed through Grand Junction and Deliv to optimize the most efficient route for every package. And it's unlocked by integrating Shipt's delivery capability into our last-mile operation. \n Our sortation center expansion will add meaningful speed and efficiency to our fulfillment capabilities so we can field continued growth for the long term. \n [Presentation] \nJohn Mulligan: The ongoing investments in our supply chain are designed to keep our stores at the center of how we serve our guests. Just as important are the continued investments we make in the physical stores themselves. Since 2017, we've completed top-to-bottom remodels across nearly half our chain, bringing even more inspiration to the store environment while helping our team more effectively support online fulfillment. \n This year, we'll remodel around 200 stores and keep that pace in the years that follow. And these aren't the same remodels we are rolling out when we started. Each year, our architects and construction crews update our plans to keep raising the bar on retail design. And our guests continue to tell us they like what they see. Following a remodel, traffic gains across the store helped drive an average 2% to 4% sales lift in year 1 and another 1% to 2% lift in year 2. \n As our full store program continues, we'll also invest in hundreds of smaller projects to support growing in-store partnerships, including Ulta Beauty, Disney and Starbucks, and they make store fulfillment even easier for our team. As we invest in existing -- in our existing store portfolio, we'll continue to open around 30 new stores a year. For the better part of the last decade, our store growth has been driven by small formats. With a more flexible footprint, these stores have enabled us to enter new markets and reach more guests. \n This year, we'll keep going, opening doors in iconic sites, from the historic streets of Charleston, South Carolina to the buzzing energy of Times Square. At the same time, small isn't always got planned. But our store is now more productive than ever. There are benefits to a bigger box. And given the favorable real estate market, these sites are available at attractive deals. I'm not talking about our largest store formats, though they continue to do extremely well for us. I'm talking about midsized stores, 2 to 3x bigger than our small formats. These sites are built in dense neighborhoods with enough room for a traditional store experience and digital fulfillment, helping us bring Target closer to even more guests. \n This versatility is another example of how we built a flexible operation to support our growth. Ten years ago, we designed and built 2 store formats: large and larger. Today, we have the opportunity to open and operate stores in spaces of any size so we can meet our guests wherever they are. This year, we'll open stores ranging from 14,000 square feet to 10x that size, using that flexibility to design shopping experiences that best meet the needs of each local community. \n And before I hand it over to Mark, I'll close with how I started with our team. You heard it from Brian and Jen, our store director in Wisconsin, \"We're still in the early days of our growth strategy.\" And it's our team, continuing to accelerate capabilities and build trust with our guests that will keep Target growing well into the future. As we've invested in their growth, from wages and benefits that you heard about today, to education, skill training and career progression, internal surveys show our team's engagement, morale and confidence in Target's future remain strong. That stability has led to better guest service, more collaboration, and as Brian said, a finer ability to flex, adapt and navigate the new challenges of being a bigger, stronger Target. \n When we take care of our team, they take care of our guests, proof that Target's culture will power our strategy to deliver ease, inspiration and joy for our guests for years to come. Take a look. \n [Presentation] \nMark Schindele: Good morning, everyone. One of the best parts about my job is getting to spend time with our team every week in stores across the country. And I hear stories like those we just shared in the video, stories about what Target means to our team. And there's no doubt that our more than 300,000 store team members, who interact with our guests every day, are Target's biggest asset and our single-greatest differentiator. They inspire me as they bring our purpose to life every single day. \n And I'm excited to talk about them and what they do, including ways that may not show up on the balance sheet. Take Terence, for example. He's a team member in our Fairview Heights, Illinois store who stopped what he was doing to help change a guest's flat tire in our parking lot. Her response, \"He's my hero. I'll be looking for him every time I go in that store just to tell him how special he is.\" Or [ Manu ], a leader in our Maui store, who helped the elderly community in the remote town of Hana. She partnered with a local nonprofit to help them get the essentials they needed when they couldn't make it to the store in person. \n Our team is there to help our guests every day, handing them clean carts as they walk in our front doors, helping them find that perfect item on the shelf, dropping their bags into their car or shipping orders out the back to their homes. They show up for local communities and each other day in and day out. And that's why when we set out to put our stores at the heart of everything we do, it was clear that the most important investment we could make was in our team. \n We know an engaged team is more productive and creates a better experience for our guests. And over the last year, we've invested in wages, debt-free education and made even more of our team eligible for health benefits. We've also focused on desired hours and more reliable schedules through one-on-one conversations with our team, and we have an ongoing commitment to develop our team to get to wherever they want to go. \n We've also seen great growth in our new on-demand scheduling option we introduced this year, with more than 35,000 team members already signed up. It's a perfect opportunity for those team members who mainly want a couple of shifts a month or a college student who wants to work over the holiday season when she's back over winter break. Together, our investments and consistent hours for our team and the flexibility of on-demand models help us deliver for our guests while supporting the diverse needs of our team. \n Even as the U.S. labor market is seeing some of the highest turnover on record, our rate in Target stores remains below pre-pandemic levels. Our stores are fully staffed, and we've been able to leverage the training and the tenure of our team to easily shift against demand without missing a beat.\n Let's talk about the experience we're delivering for our guests. Target is the easiest place for our guests to get everything they need, no matter how they choose to shop. Even in a year as unpredictable as 2021, we saw satisfaction rise with gains in many of our most important drivers of guest experience, like interacting with our team on the sales floor and wait time at checkout. In fact, over the past 2 years, our already impressive overall Net Promoter Score increased more than 10%, a true testament to our team's commitment to service.\n In every store from the register, the Drive Up lane, our team is building loyalty with guests, offering ease, convenience and incredible service that keeps them coming back. For example, more than 60% of our new Drive Up guests return to use it again that month. And when a guest tries a new same-day service for the first time, they spend more at Target going forward, including in our stores. And last year, more than half of our digital sales came from our same-day services.\n In the year ahead, we'll fuel that momentum, deepening our trust with our guests with an experience our competitors can't match. That means clean, bright and on-brand floors that invite discovery, inspire guests with the latest products, all brought to life by an incredible team, a team that's empowered and trained across the building so they can jump in wherever our guests need us.\n And we've developed a flexible framework of service so every single team member can engage and connect and problem-solve with guests across the store. We'll continue to backup train every new team member on same-day services so we can easily adjust for peaks and in-store pickup. And we're offering continuous learning and development moments throughout the year in key categories and new brands.\n We know operational excellence and service go hand in hand, so we're focused on nailing the fundamentals and making shopping at Target easy and special for our guests. Take a look. \n [Presentation] \nMark Schindele: In nearly 2,000 communities across the country, our Target team provides great in-store experience and easy fulfillment options. With same-day services already at scale from coast to coast, we are ready for when guest shopping behavior changed. And as we've seen demand grow, our team is able to support that growth and accelerate our progress to meet guests' needs along the way.\n In the past year, we've added adult beverage and expanded our assortment for pickup. We built in more personalized features like sending a friend or a family member when plans change, choosing where you'd like your order placed in your car or selecting a backup option if something's out of stock. We even doubled the amount of Drive Up parking spaces in the holiday season so guests could get those last-minute gifts without leaving their cars.\n Our guests love our same-day services, and they provide great cost savings of nearly 90% per unit compared to shipping from an upstream warehouse. In the year ahead, we'll keep improving Order Pickup and Drive Up offerings with a focus on quality, speed and great service. We'll continue to expand the assortment available, and we'll add the Backup Item functionality to even more categories. In the months since we rolled out this option, our teams are able to substitute the Backup Items 98% of the time.\n Everything we do at Target is grounded in making our guests' daily lives even easier. We want every Target run to be fast, convenient and rewarding, and that includes the return process. Our teams are building the capability to accept returns from the Drive Up lane with plans to test later this year. So guests will be able to check everything out their shopping list and return a product that wasn't quite right at the same time and without leaving the car.\n And lastly, I'm really excited we're going to pilot the ability to order Starbucks for Drive Up so guests can get everything on their list and request their morning latte when they're on the way while never even unbuckling their seatbelt. We'll take a test-and-learn approach in select markets throughout the summer and fall with a goal of eventually making this option available from coast to coast.\n To bring these enhancements to life and continue strengthening our operations, our team is working to streamline on the back end, even further integrating the omnichannel experience into how we run and staff our stores. Now, of course, nothing at Target happens in a vacuum, so we're working with partners from across the organization, from tech and digital to supply chain and properties, to support these capabilities. The ability of our store teams to ship local orders out our back doors continues to increase our speed to guests while delivering cost savings of more than 40% per unit versus upstream shipping.\n We're working closely with our supply chain partners as we roll out more sortation centers across the country. As you heard from John, we're excited about the efficiencies they'll continue adding to our ship-from-store operation. Frequent sweeps of our stores to a local sortation center frees up space in our backrooms, and centralizing the sorting process helps our team be more productive and saves valuable time.\n Our teams are focused on greater ease and efficiency with store staffing, especially when it comes to same-day options, so we can be ready to flex with guest demand. We're enhancing our technology to give store leaders an even clear real-time picture of fulfillment needs and testing out new tools to help them better predict guest patterns in the future, helping us be even more efficient in staffing, the right teams at the right times, ready to do the work and deliver for our guests.\n We're making upgrades to physical spaces that support these services, remodeling our stores with more hold capacity, adding dedicated doors with easy access to the exterior. We're adding more Drive Up spaces to our parking lots, and we're even adding some camps in stores that get bad weather. Also our teams can get orders to guests quickly and safely every time.\n And inside our stores, we're making improvements to the process itself to make things even easier for our team and better for our guests, like finding the most efficient ways to pick orders from how we deploy the team members, to technology that helps reduce footsteps throughout the store, all with the goal of continuing to deliver the ease and convenience our guests expect.\n Our solid operational foundation and stores-as-hub model has allowed Target to be there for our guests even when the world shifted around us, and they'll continue to be the engines of our growth. That foundation is made even stronger by the deep roots of empathy and care and everything our teams do to keep us moving forward together.\n And before I turn it over to Rick, I can't miss the opportunity to say thank you to our team. With stores at the center of how we serve guests across the country, they've risen to every challenge with care, resilience and flexibility, not only meeting guest needs today but ensuring we'll be ready for them tomorrow. Thank you. \nRichard Gomez: Thank you, Mark. I am proud to be here today representing Target's Food & Beverage team because getting to $20 billion in sales last year, delivering double-digit growth on top of 2020's double-digit growth, achieving millions of dollars in market share gains and becoming America's fourth-biggest digital grocer and being named Retailer of the Year by Supermarket News, well, none of that happened by chance.\n As some of you know, we've been on a journey when it comes to groceries at Target. Food has always played an important role in driving trips and basket size, but we knew we could do so much more in this space. Today, Target is a company that doesn't just sell food. We are a company that celebrates food with a grocery business that's driving trips and basket size and, even more importantly, loyalty. It's become part of the differentiated experience that separates Target from the pack.\n Now before joining Target's marketing team back in 2013, I spent my entire career working for iconic food and beverage brands. That experience taught me that food and beverage is a business that is deeply personal for consumers, and that's what our team is delivering at Target. Central to our success is the fact that what we're doing is 100% unapologetically Target. That means we're not copying competitors or trying to do something we're not. Instead, we're listening to our guests, and we're leaning into what's special about Target: to provide a better experience at a great value. That's led to amazing results, a deeper sense of loyalty from our guests and the opportunity to do even more.\n A great example of this is our digital business. It's hard to believe, but just 2 years ago, fresh and frozen order pickup in-store and curbside was just a small test in a few markets. But when the pandemic hit, we knew we had to accelerate our plans to meet guests' fast-pacing changing needs. So in a matter of just a few months, we installed refrigerators and freezers for order pickup in hundreds of stores nationwide. We trained thousands of team members to pick online grocery orders. And we rolled out new marketing to raise awareness that if you're looking for safe, quick, easy option for getting your groceries and essentials, that's, by the way, free with no order minimum requirement, well, then Target is your place.\n When you think about the power of team, there are a few better examples than how in the middle of the pandemic and amidst of peak-level sales, we mobilized teams from across the company to undertake this monumental body of work because it was the right thing to do for our guests, and it was the right thing to do for our business. It really has been a game changer for so many families looking to limit trips outside their homes and into stores. And it has revolutionized our food and beverage experience, turning Target into an omnichannel grocery powerhouse.\n And we'll continue to make our pickup service even better. For instance, since launching Fresh and Frozen Pickup, we've also added Adult Beverage Pickup to about 80% of our stores. And I am so excited about what Mark just shared with Starbucks as part of our Drive Up experience.\n But it's important to recognize that there's still a lot of potential in front of us. But even as guests have started reclaiming some of their routines, including making more trips into our target stores, our digital business, fueled by Shipt, and our Order Pickup services, continues to grow.\n Look at the numbers. At the end of 2019, our digital penetration in Food & Beverage was 2.3%. We ended 2020 at 9.6%. We closed 2021 at 13.2%. Our 2021 digital sales were up $900 million over 2020 and up by sixfold over 2019. Our Net Promoter Scores consistently show that guests love our digital services. So as we keep driving awareness and trial and adding new experiences, we anticipate continued growth.\n Another area we're driving awareness and trial has led to ongoing growth is in our owned brand assortment. Back in 2019, we rolled out our flagship-owned brand, Good & Gather. It was the largest owned brand launch ever. Today, it totals nearly 2,500 items across Food & Beverage and is helping change perceptions about the shopping experience at Target. It's affordable. It's delicious, and it's on trend. Whether you're looking for a quick easy Tuesday night dinner or something fun for entertaining during March Madness, Good & Gather is everything our guests have long expected from Target's owned brands. And today, its growth is outpacing the industry average for private-label brands.\n And there's more. Favorite Day, a new brand of craveable baked goods and treats that draws guests into the food aisles. For instance, some of you might have come to Target because their kindergartner lost a sneaker and she has gym class tomorrow. But while dad's there, he might as well reward himself with a container of Peanut Butter Monster Trail Mix for the home office.\n Now Target-owned brands are only part of the story. We are also elevating our assortment by diversifying our assortment because we know that representation is critical to ensuring that we are -- that our offering is relevant to all our guests. Now when we decided at the beginning of last year to accelerate our commitment to adding more Black-owned brands, we had a dozen in our Food & Beverage assortment. But by changing the way we work, working hard to build new relationships and by using our size and scale to help brands grow for success in mass retail, we'll end 2022 with more than 50 Black-owned brands in our Food & Beverage assortment.\n And we won't stop there. Because these brands don't just make us more relevant, they make our assortment better. A great example is McBride Sisters wine, a Black female-owned business. We actually started working with them back in 2018 with a small partnership in about 100 stores in the South. Today, McBride Sisters is available in over 1,200 stores; or Everything Legendary, a company one of our buyers saw on television and couldn't wait to work with. So the next morning, he picked up the phone, sparking a relationship that led to Everything Legendary becoming Target's first Black-owned, plant-based meat supplier.\n And Target has taken a strong position in coffee, a category where our guests have especially high expectations. Black & Bold is a 3.5-year-old company founded by 2 childhood friends, and they have put social impact at the center of their business model, giving 5% of their profit to support kids and underserved communities. It's a company that we knew is a perfect fit for Target. They were our first Black-owned coffee brand. Today -- well, today, they're available in 1,300 stores and online. The response has been amazing. I love the suite.\n Now you got to go to Target and by a Keurig and the Black-owned coffee, Black and Bold. That tweet also brings me to another key differentiator in Target: the role we play as part of Target's multi-category assortment. That's something that sets Target apart on everyday trips and especially around holidays and key seasonal moments. Target dominates holiday seasons because guests love that they can get everything they need at Target: Halloween candy and costumes; the Thanksgiving turkey and games for the kids while the adults are gathering in the kitchen or watching football; and, of course, everything you need to make Hannukah, Christmas, Kwanza, 3 Kings Day special, including our robust selection of gingerbread houses.\n And this trend is continuing in 2022 as we saw during the first big seasonal moment of this year, Valentine's Day. Through the power of the total Target experience, the way we innovate, including our new Favorite Day, Valentine's Sugar Cookie kits, building on Target's cachet and the gingerbread space, and the platform we provide for our national brand partners to do amazing things to grow their brands, our team came through with the kind of Valentine's Day experience that makes Target special. In fact, we delivered our biggest Valentine's Candy sales ever, and we did it by the close of business on February 13. We did it with a day to spare. And we reached another milestone on February 13, finishing the week with record sales for snacks ahead of the Super Bowl.\n And despite all of this, what's so exciting to our team is that there's still a lot of room for us to improve, grow and gain even more market share in food for years to come. For instance, our research shows that even our best guests underestimate the breadth of our assortment, thinking they can only get some of their groceries at Target. As we continue to raise awareness of our full offering and we get credit for what we are already doing and the value that we provide, well, that is a huge opportunity.\n You heard Christina talk earlier about accessibility and affordability. That's why the Digital Snap payment option we're rolling out this year is so important to Food & Beverage. It's going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries. And as we move more product faster than ever through our distribution network, we are continuing to look for ways to move that product even faster. Some of our improvement will come from the way we work with our national brand suppliers, encouraging them to prioritize the growth opportunity that Target represents. We're also working to better utilize our food distribution centers to keep up with the fast-growing demand.\n We'll continue leveraging the power of our owned brands for everyday needs and big seasonal moments. And I'm excited that for the first time, we're going to have a holiday-themed Favorite Day assortment this year.\n And then there's Circle. It's especially crucial to what we're doing in food, raising awareness of our assortment and the value that we offer. As you heard from Cara, we are not done growing what's already one of America's biggest and most vibrant loyalty programs. And as our marketing team continues to build on the success of Circle, that's going to help our entire business, but especially Food & Beverage.\n We have a lot to be proud of. And there's a lot of opportunity, and yes, a lot of work in front of us. But when I think about the future, I'd say my optimism is rooted in our team. So before handing off to Michael, I'll close with one more thought on team. Over the last couple of years, we've hired scores of Food & Beverage directors and coordinators, people with immense expertise in the grocery industry who are helping us drive continuous improvement across our operations. \n A few weeks ago, I was visiting stores in Colorado, and I was talking to one of our coordinators, Bridget. I asked her why she joined Target. Now keep in mind, this is someone who joined us from another retailer, someone who already had a good job and was doing well in her career. But when I posed this question, the first thing she said goes to what Brian was talking about in his intro, she talked about culture. Bridget was willing to take a risk in her career to leave a situation that was pretty good and give Target a chance because of what she heard about being a part of this team.\n She told me a lot about the people she works with, the support she has to make decisions that are right for the guest and the partnership she has with team members working in other categories. Bridget told me it was everything I hope for and more. In this environment, the race for talent is just as intense as the race for sales. But every day, people are opting in to be a part of the Target team. Because of what we have already achieved? Absolutely, but even more so because of the possibility of what we can do going forward. \n I'm just as proud of that and inspired by that as I am of any of the numbers that we've shared today. Because when I think about everything in front of us, team members like Bridget and the human touch and the guest focus that our entire team brings to their work, well, that is what it's going to ensure that our guests can always count on Target. \n Thank you so much. And now I'll hand things over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, Rick. At the top of the meeting, Brian shared some of the key milestones from the last 5 years. And I'd like to begin my remarks today by highlighting one more, which is the long-term financial algorithm we unveiled during that time. You'll recall that the prior algorithm anticipated low single-digit sales growth, mid-single-digit operating income growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, after tax ROIC in the mid- to high teens.\n In the 2 years leading up to the pandemic, our business was consistently generating top line performance in line with the algorithm as we saw average sales growth of 3.7% in 2018 and 2019. And on the bottom line during that period, our business grew somewhat ahead of the algorithm with average adjusted EPS growth of 16.7% over those 2 years and an average after-tax ROIC of 15.4%.\n Since the beginning of 2020, COVID has changed nearly every aspect of consumers' lives, and we've all seen its impact on the retail industry. At Target, our team and durable model navigated these changes incredibly well, advancing our business far ahead of expectations. Simply put, over the last 2 years, our financial performance blew away the prior algorithm from top to bottom. And today, we're a much larger retailer, generating industry-leading returns on capital.\n As we enter 2020, things remain far from ordinary, but a future beyond this volatile time is taking shape. And given the durable and sustainable model we've built and the ongoing investments we're making, we've updated our financial algorithm, which will define our long-term expectations beginning next year, in 2023, and beyond. This updated algorithm demonstrates our confidence in Target's ability to continue growing on top of the incredible expansion over the last couple of years.\n Specifically, over time, our updated long-term algorithm anticipates mid-single-digit annual growth in both total revenue and operating income, high single-digit annual growth in adjusted EPS, annual CapEx of $4 billion to $5 billion, after-tax ROIC in the high 20% to 30% range. Compared with our prior algorithm, this new one leans more into growth driven primarily by comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores and continued growth from other revenue sources. Our confidence in Target's ability to continue growing is based on all of the initiatives you've heard about today, which are designed to drive engagement, traffic and market share gains, including: new stores; remodels; national brand partnerships and owned brand innovations; expansion of our same-day services; growth of new and emerging revenue sources; further rollout of sortation centers; continued investments in value and affordability; leveraging guest insights to enhance our assortment and promotions while personalizing the guest experience; elevating guest service through investments in the team, training and technology, all while investing in Target Forward, to enhance the long-term sustainability of the business and the planet.\n Since today is the first time we've included other revenue in our top line guidance, I want to pause and cover some of what's reflected in that line of the P&L and what's been driving its growth. And while there are many smaller items represented on this slide, profit sharing income on our credit card portfolio has historically accounted for more than half of it. But in recent years, Roundel has been the primary growth driver of this line, causing it to become its second largest component. I want to emphasize, however, that Roundel's impact extends well beyond the amount reflected on this line alone as a meaningful portion of Roundel's income reduces our cost of sales, benefiting our gross margin. Among other notable drivers, Shipt membership fees are included on this line, along with the fees we received from third-party vendors on Target Plus, which are expected to grow over time.\n Moving to the operating income line. You'll note that our long-term growth expectations are consistent with the prior algorithm, but we don't rely on rate expansion to get there. Now I should quickly point out, we'll happily welcome rate expansion when it happens for the right reasons, including the massive scale benefits we've realized over the last 2 years. But as I've said many times, given that we're focused on maximizing profit dollar growth, our plans account for the inherent trade-off between profit rates and top line growth. Put another way, a durable business model anticipates the need for continual investments to deliver sustainable growth. As such, we've built an algorithm based on driving and harvesting continued efficiencies in our business and continually reinvesting those savings in growth that further differentiates Target through our team, our stores and the entire guest experience.\n Among the factors that will drive our operating margin rate over time, we expect the headwinds and tailwinds will generally balance each other out. On the gross margin line, those factors include merchandise mix, channel mix and merchandising strategies. On the SG&A line, cost leverage, efficiency gains and team investments are most notable. On the D&A line, leverage and accelerated depreciation are the primary drivers. Also consistent with the prior algorithm, this updated one anticipates high single-digit growth in adjusted EPS driven by mid-single-digit growth in operating income combined with the benefit of continued share repurchases.\n Moving on to capital deployment. I want to first reiterate our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. Our top priority is to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. We then look to support the dividend and build on our 50-year record of consecutive annual dividend increases. And finally, when we have capacity beyond those first 2 uses, we repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\n Beginning with investments in our business. We expect ongoing CapEx will be in the $4 billion to $5 billion range annually, and we'll be focused first on our continued investments in our stores-as-hubs model, including new locations, full store remodels, fulfillment retrofits and projects to support key national brand partnerships. In addition, as John outlined, we'll continue to invest in our upstream supply chain, sortation centers and DC automation to further reduce store workload.\n Even after these sizable CapEx investments, we expect to have ample capacity for shareholder returns as well given the robust operating cash flow our business continues to generate, amounting to more than $8.5 billion in 2021. We'll maintain our focus on growing the annual dividend, something we've accomplished for 50 consecutive years and look to maintain a 40% payout ratio over time. In addition, given our expectation for continued strong cash generation by our business, we'll have the capacity to return capital through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\n Finally, the most dramatic change from our prior algorithm pertains to our after-tax ROIC, where our updated range of expectations is 10-plus percentage points higher than before. This change highlights the asset efficiency of our stores-as-hubs model, which has unlocked the full potential of our store locations to flexibly serve our guests. With this model, our business has generated revenue growth of more than 35% or nearly $28 billion over the last 2 years, largely on the existing asset base.\n Now I want to move on to expectations for this year. As I step back and think about where we are and where we've been, it's clear we're still in the midst of the pandemic, but we've entered a new phase. In this phase, we're still facing multiple challenges and uncertainties, including a tight labor market and persistent supply chain bottlenecks, which are contributing to higher inflation rates than we've seen in decades. And beyond those ongoing challenges, we'll soon get to see how the consumer and economy move beyond government stimulus as we compare over the large first quarter packages that benefited consumers both in 2020 and again, last year.\n However, the last couple of years have also proven the durability and flexibility of our business and financial model. Specifically, relying on stores as fulfillment hubs allows our team to conveniently and efficiently serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. This includes our suite of same-day services, which differentiate Target and provide a reliable, fast and easy shopping experience. Our model features a unique brand and balanced merchandise -- broad and balanced merchandise assortment, allowing us to serve guests and drive trips to serve a wide variety of wants and needs. And our long history of investing in value and affordability, which has long been a key differentiator, becomes even more important in an inflationary environment.\n As a result, with a proven model and the multiple growth investments we've highlighted today, we expect to continue growing the top line in 2022, generating a low to mid-single-digit increase in revenue, on top of historically strong growth over the last 2 years. On the operating margin line this year, we're planning to deliver a rate of 8% or higher, reflecting several deliberate rate investments to position our business for long-term profitable growth.\n First on that list are continued investments in pay and benefits to support our team as we build on the enormous progress we've made over the past few years. Beyond the team, this year's investments in growth capacity will drive some rate pressure. And we're planning for a small increase in markdown rates in 2022 as we move past the dramatically low rates we've seen over the last couple of years. Finally, and importantly, we'll continue to focus on value and affordability in this inflationary environment. That means taking a thoughtful long-term approach to pricing decisions, ensuring that we deliver unbeatable value for our guests.\n We have many levers to combat costs, and price is the one we pull last, not first. As a result, product costs within our assortment have risen faster than retail in recent quarters, reflecting this intentional approach in deliberate pacing. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the first half of this year as we maintain our focus on affordability for our guests. Altogether, given our expectations for revenue growth and purposeful operating margin rate investments, we're positioned to deliver low single-digit growth in operating income dollars this year.\n Consistent with the longer term, we expect CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range this year. This range is wider than we typically see at this point of the year given continued delays in receiving fixtures and equipment, along with permitting and inspection delays in local communities. Put another way, our hope is to be at the top end of this range in 2022, but it's possible that external factors will continue to affect certain projects.\n Regarding the dividend, later this year, we plan to recommend that our Board approve a per share dividend increase in the 20% to 30% range as we continue to move toward a 40% payout ratio over time. In addition, given our current cash position and expectations for strong cash flow, we believe our 2022 share repurchases will be at or above the $7 billion we accomplished in 2021.\n Putting all of our expectations together, a low to mid-single-digit revenue increase, an operating margin rate of 8% or higher and continued robust share repurchase activity, we're positioned to generate high single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this year, on top of a 112% increase over the last 2 years.\n While I'm not going to provide detailed quarterly guidance today, I want to pause and talk about how our 2022 profit performance is expected to play out within the year given some of the unique factors involved. Specifically, in the front half of this year, we'll be annualizing last year's government stimulus while facing ongoing supply chain pressures and other cost increases. In contrast, as the year progresses, we'll begin comping over the period of higher costs that emerged in the back half of last year, while our supply chain and merchandising strategies have more time to adjust. As such, we expect our quarterly profit performance will be choppy during the year and generally improve as the year progresses.\n Q1 provides a timely example. This chart shows the variability of our Q1 profit rate over the last 3 years. Looking ahead, we expect our first quarter 2022 rate will move to something that's relatively high to our history but well below last year's 9.8% rate, which was unusually high due to some unique factors.\n As I get ready to close my remarks, I want to pause and spend a minute talking about the key role that efficiency and disciplined expense management have played in our recent success and how we're committed to maintaining that discipline going forward. And while I can provide many examples of our team's cost discipline, I want to focus on a couple of notable ones.\n First on that list are meaningful efficiency gains we've realized in digital fulfillment. Across each of our digital fulfillment nodes, from package delivery to in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, we've implemented multiple processes and process improvements and rolled out new technology to remove costs and increase speed to our guests. As a result, over the last 3 years, our average per unit digital fulfillment costs have declined by more than 50%, reflecting both efficiency gains and the benefit of mix as our most efficient same-day services have become a bigger and bigger portion of our digital sales.\n Looking ahead, the rollout of sortation centers presents a compelling opportunity to further reduce the unit cost of last-mile delivery. As John mentioned, in the Twin Cities market, where we've been piloting our first sortation center, we've seen our average per unit last-mile fulfillment costs go down by nearly 1/3.\n The second example I want to highlight is the enormous benefit we've realized from the investments we've been making in our team. These investments have driven positive change to the lives of hundreds of thousands of team members, offering more steady income, pathways to career growth and education and access to benefits that meet their evolving needs. But these investments are delivering efficiency and growth in our business as well. A portion of these gains come directly from the fact that with high retention rates and improved training, our team can accomplish tasks more efficiently than in the past.\n But that's just the beginning. Because of our investments in the team, they're continually delivering higher levels of service, building on the trust we've established with our guests. This results in higher satisfaction scores, higher engagements and more return visits. And with higher service levels, Target becomes a more attractive partner for leading national brands, enabling partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Apple, Disney and Levi's.\n Once you've accounted for all of the efficiency and top line benefits that have come from our team investments, you can see why I reiterate time and time again that caring for and investing in our team is the best long-term investment we can make in our business. In fact, whether I'm looking at these investments as the CFO or through the lens of my earlier role supporting stores or leading pay and benefits for our HR team, the lessons are consistent. Whether you're talking about physical capital or human capital, underinvesting might lead to great-looking results over a very short period, but they're not sustainable over time.\n So before I close, I want to pause and express my gratitude to our team, many of whom are listening into this meeting today. You have delivered industry-leading results over the last couple of years while taking care of our guests and each other. And importantly, during that time, you've made Target a much stronger company, positioning us to deliver sustainable, profitable growth from a significantly larger retail platform.\n I want to thank you all on behalf of all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. \nBrian Cornell: We began this meeting talking about our path: 5 years, from $70 billion to $106 billion. We took you through our present, our strengths, our enablers and our culture of care. Now I'd like to talk about our future. We see a growth horizon for years to come. We will continue to invest in our strategies. We'll continue to invest in our capabilities. We'll continue to nurture a team that cares, cares about work that has purpose, cares about work that has meaning. We are growing teams that embrace our commitment to their career growth and development, our commitment to competitive pay and benefits, our commitment to being a premier American brand, our commitment to growing teams that care.\n Yes, we have the team and we have the strategy. We are 100% focused on the needs of American consumers. We have some of the most innovative and guest-centric capabilities in retail. We have a balance sheet that is the envy of the industry. And we have a record of cash generation you can count on, provide incredible value to our stakeholders.\n Yes, as we look at the growth horizon in front of us, we see many opportunities. As we move forward, we'll stay focused on helping our guests navigate through continued uncertainty with what's happening in the world around us, the pandemic and the macroeconomic environment. This includes the highest inflation in decades and the gradual loosening of supply chain bottlenecks. We'll stay focused on delivering value and affordability to our guests. We know how to deliver exceptional value and manage profitability. We can protect prices whenever possible. We can offer an unbeatable range of owned and national brands across our portfolio categories. We can bake value into our assortment, and we'll work with our vendor partners from sourcing to production to shipping. We'll ensure that those prices we offer will always be among the best in American retail.\n We have a strong record of thoughtful investment in supply chain and innovation. We provide a competitive advantage by keeping our stores stocked and our digital orders filled. We have the flexibility we need to contain with constraints so we can keep growing and thriving in any environment. And above all, we have the team.\n A few days ago, I visited several Minnesota stores. I was impressed with the Ulta Beauty displays, with our Disney shops, with our Apple stores, but what impressed me most was a team member who came up to me and said, \"Brian, I'm so proud to be working at Target. I'm proud of how you're handling the pandemic. I'm proud to be part of the Target team.\" We have a team that's committed to making Target of the future even better, the Target of the future even stronger and the Target of the future even more caring.\n For everyone who's listening today, including our teams across the globe, know we're already working to determine the best way to support humanitarian efforts for the people of Ukraine. As we have throughout the last couple of years, we'll rally our team, put our resources to work to support families through these challenging times.\n And with that, I'm going to ask all of our speakers to join me on stage, and we'll start taking your questions. \nBrian Cornell: All right. As we get started, I would ask you to wait for a microphone. Please introduce yourself. While you can see us, however, it's a challenging time seeing you. So I'll look for a show of hands. We've got one right up front. \nChristopher Horvers: Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. So my first question, I have 2, is in the long-term sales guide, it seems like you're baking in about a 3.5% to 4% comp. Is that fair? And how are you thinking about the share gains component of that? Because you've gained a lot of share in the past few years. 3.5% to 4% seems like a very sort of normal rate of consumption growth in the economy. So is that -- are you baking in any share gains? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, do you want to start? And then I'll come back and talk about our approach to share. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. As we think about the long-term algorithm, comp growth will certainly be the biggest driver there. Where that lands in a given year, might be up or down. But I'll tell you, we expect to be a business that continues to grow and gain share year-over-year. The investments we're making are to drive outsized growth, and that should come with share gains. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. And Chris, I'll give you a sense for how we run the business each and every day. And I can tell you, this team spends hours each week looking at share by category across our markets to make sure that we have the plans in place to constantly be taking share as we go forward. So there's lots of different metrics we look at as a team. I would tell you this team spends a tremendous amount of time looking at share, share opportunities, building plans to make sure the over $10 billion of share we've gained in the last couple of years is something that we continue to move forward as the years go by. So we are very focused on share, and our guidance will certainly be a company that continues to take share across the entire multi-category portfolio both in stores and from a digital standpoint. \nChristopher Horvers: And so my follow-up question is on gross margin. It seems like there's going to be some pressure this year, more so in the first half on some of the price that you're absorbing. But if you look at the past few years since 2019, it looks like you've gained somewhere around 250 bps of promotional clearance efficiency. How do you think about the structural component of that over the long term, balancing higher levels of store productivity versus clearance and then normalized promotion? \nMichael Fiddelke: I think your question grabbed about all the different variables there, Chris. So I'll do my best to summarize. The shape of profit for the year will be like we described, where you could expect it to build over the course of the year. When it comes to markdowns specifically, there's some markdowns that we've been rooting for returning. To be better in stock with stronger inventory levels means a few more clearance markdowns, and we're planning for that outcome in the upcoming year.\n When it comes to promotional markdowns, we should realize some sustained benefits in markdown efficiency as we've gotten bigger, and we'll stay close to the competitive environment to make sure that we're priced right every day and that we're competitive on promotion as well. \nBrian Cornell: Great. It looks like we've got a question right over here. \nMichael Lasser: It's Michael Lasser from UBS. One of the key messages that you've delivered today is that Target is a growth company. You've raised your long-term guidance to reflect that. What's inspiring the view that growth is going to be higher moving forward than it's been in the past? Is it that really you've proven it out over the last couple of years? And if that's the case, what behaviors do you expect to be sustained moving forward that the consumers have been engaging in during the midst of a pandemic? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nBrian Cornell: Christina, do you want to spend a few minutes talking about some of the consumer dynamics we're looking at right now? \nA. Hennington: Yes, I'd be happy to. First of all, we have seen a sustained growth over a multiyear period. That's been led across the entirety of the portfolio. We've seen this past year alone double-digit growth in every single one of our key 5 merchandising areas.\n The other thing is, and Cara talked about this quite a bit, but the depth of engagement of the consumer leading to more trip frequency is what we believe will have continued sustainable growth, let alone all the initiatives we talked about. We're just in the beginning of our rollout of some of these national brand partnerships that are adding meaningful productivity, trip consolidation and opportunity for growth. So it's a paradigm that we've seen proven out over the last 2 years and is continuing to give us the confidence that that's going to drive growth going forward. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. And Michael, I might focus on 4 areas as we sit here today. One, for those of you who have been attending these meetings over the last 3, 4 or 5 years, whether in person or from a virtual standpoint, one, I think the consistency of our strategy is critically important. And I think we've got great alignment across the organization. As Christina mentioned, from a capability standpoint, we're still in some of the early days. As much as we've been talking about remodeling stores, John Mulligan going all the way back to a meeting in 2015, we've touched about half the chain. We've got another thousand stores that we're going to touch going forward.\n We're very excited about the pipeline of new stores. And as John talked about, various size stores that allow us to maximize share opportunities in these catchments. From a same-day fulfillment standpoint, while we're very excited about the progress we made, Rick and Mark can talk about the potential upside as we think about temperature-controlled products going through Drive Up and pickup.\n So in so many areas from a own brand standpoint, from a national brand standpoint, rolling out these partnerships that we talked about a lot today, but many of them are still in limited locations. There's tremendous upside there. We think as we continue to build out our circle and our connection with our guests, there's continued upsized opportunities there. So a consistent strategy, capabilities that are still maturing, but I'll come back to the importance of our team and culture and the investments we've been making. And those are only going to strengthen our business model over time.\n The one point that perhaps we didn't call out specifically that I think is really a hallmark of Target today is we combine that focus on strategy and building capabilities and investing in our team and culture with a team that's focused on execution. And if you look at the results, how we got from $70 billion to $106 billion, yes, the strategy was critically important. And listening to the guests as we formulate that strategy was incredibly valuable. The capability certainly allowed us to accelerate during the pandemic. Those investments in team and culture, they have supported us throughout the pandemic. But this is a team that's been executing every day from a store standpoint, from a digital standpoint, category by category.\n And Michael, I think our execution will only improve in the out-years, which gives me tremendous confidence in the future growth and market share opportunities we will capture. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. The only thing I might tack on to that is the algorithm contemplates those investments. The CapEx we're putting to work, the way we've described operating margin and the fuel we can create to reinvest in the business. Growth doesn't just happen, you have to invest in it. The algorithm contemplates that. \nMichael Lasser: And my second question is Target's operating margin has gone from 6% to 8% over the last couple of years. Presumably, a lot of that's come from a 30% increase in your store productivity, which is pretty extraordinary, coupled with a reduction in your average unit cost to fulfill online orders. The expectation coming into the meeting was you'll give a little bit more of that 8% margin back. You're arguing, \"No, we're going to keep that.\" So what is it about what's happened that you think is more sustainable moving forward that contrast that prior to the pandemic? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, I might ask John Mulligan to just spend a few minutes just talking about the benefits of scale. And as we've added almost $28 billion to our system, we talked about -- John talked about some of the highlights of -- our average store has added $15 million of growth. And those scale benefits and efficiency help fuel our business going forward.\n So John, you may want to highlight some of the benefits from an operational standpoint. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes, I think that's right there. I mean you hit on what the 2 big drivers are. One is scale. And as we get bigger, there's benefits that flow through the individual store P&L. First of all, they're leveraging all the fixed stuff. That's the easy-peasy part, but everything becomes more efficient. When we go from $40 million to $55 million, we may only add one truck a week to that store or 2 trucks a week. We don't double the number of trucks that a store has to work. So you gain efficiency there in the backroom as you're moving inventory to the front of the store. Things like that just create efficiency.\n Again, once you're out on the floor and stocking goods, if you're a $40 million or $55 million store, that doesn't change. You're out on the floor. If I put 2 on the shelf or 3 on the shelf, nothing really changes there. There's a marginal amount of incremental work, right? So those are the little things that create additional scale in our hourly payroll, which, of course, is the biggest expense we have. That flows down through the entire P&L.\n And then, of course, Michael talked about our same-day fulfillment and our ship-to-home fulfillment. We have improved individually each of those paths to the guests. Each one of those services, the cost structure and the mix helps us because the most -- the best NPS scores, the ones our guests like the best are same-day services, which are the most efficient as we've been talking about for a long time. And then you layer on sort centers where we said -- and look, we've had this open for 14 months, just 14 months, and we already said it's way cheaper than what we were already doing. So there's some -- I mean you've seen us do it over the last 5 years, continue to hone processes and improve them, Mark and his team, improving the pathing, improving the pick, improving the prep, improving the pack. That's a lot to say, improving all 3 of those. And we'll do that all over again with sort centers.\n So so much runway for us to continue to drive efficiency and bring expense out and continue to invest in service on the floor at the store, just a huge opportunity for us. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, just to build on that. I might ask Mark Schindele to start, just talk about some of the benefits that he's seeing because of that scale and the growth in store operations. And then Rick, one of the areas where I think we've seen a significant change in scale is in Food & Beverage. It's a $20 billion company now. And because of that growth rate and the change in our turns, particularly in fresh foods, there's enormous benefits that we're deriving.\n So Mark, why don't you start from a store standpoint with a few examples? And then, Rick, I think you can walk through some of the benefits we're seeing because of the increased volume we're seeing in stores, the increased turns and just the productivity we're gaining today. \nMark Schindele: Yes. Thanks, Brian. John shared a bit about how we're adding scale in our stores. And a couple of things I'd like to add in, when we think about our same-day services, that business just continues to grow. And that example of putting an extra box on the shelf also plays out in same-day service where you can grab an extra bag. And as we see our baskets grow, our trip frequency grows, our productivity grows.\n And we've said it often, but our most important investment we can make is in our team, and our team is doing an incredible job executing and delivering scale and efficiency every single day and creating that incredible experience for our guests. \nRichard Gomez: Yes. I mean specific to Food & Beverage, we have had a tremendous positive momentum over the past couple of years. We've been able to deliver double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth. We've been able to gain billions of dollars in market share over the past 2 years. And part of those benefits have come with that bigger businesses. Quite frankly, we are more credible in the grocery business. And as a more credible grocer in the grocery business, we have more opportunities to partner with our national brand partners.\n And so we are in negotiations when products are on allocation or they're limited due to supply chain constraints. Our national partners recognize that Target is a place to grow, and they're looking to us first. And I think that's a change of where we are today than where we've been in previous years.\n The other thing I would just say when it comes to things like produce, the faster we're moving, the fresher the product, the less the waste. So it helps us not only from a financial perspective, but actually from a guest experience perspective as well. \nBrian Cornell: Let's go to another question. I think we've got one right back here. \nAntonio Morales: Antonio Morales from Signum Research. You were talking about the national partners and national things. So do you have any plans on expanding to the international market like around the world in the short, mid or long term? \nBrian Cornell: Yes. I'll take this one. We get this question all the time. And certainly, I will never say never. But for today, as we look at the opportunities that we have right here in the United States, we're going to stay very focused on the foreseeable future, executing our plans, building on our momentum and investing in the United States before we start to think about any type of future international expansion. \n All right. We got one right back here to the left. \nPeter Benedict: Peter Benedict at Baird. First question, just on Roundel, I think you noted that it delivered $1 billion in value to Target. Can you define value? Is that revenue? Is that gross profit? Is that influenced sales? I just want a clarification on that. That's my first question. \nBrian Cornell: Cara, why don't I ask you to start with some highlights on Roundel. And Michael, maybe you can fill in the blanks from a financial standpoint. \nCara Sylvester: Yes. It's incredibly exciting to talk about the Roundel story. And the Roundel business is not a new business for us. And we've actually been able to scale it quite quickly over the last several years by really being differentiated by focusing truly at the gas at the center. And what we find is that our vendor partners love partnering with us around Roundel given those guest insights. And they -- we've been able to actually keep the guests at the center and scale that to $1 billion. We're looking to scale that even quicker to $2 billion over the next couple of years by again being truly differentiated in partnering with our vendor partners. They find incredible value in partnering with us on those guest insights.\n Michael, do you want to talk a little bit about the financials, how they roll through? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I touched on this a little bit in my remarks. You can think about $1 billion as kind of the size of the total Roundel business. And there's a piece of that, that shows up in other revenue and there's a piece of that, that helps us out on the gross margin line, too.\n But you'll notice, we don't describe it as some separate other business. Cara's point on it starts first with our guests. When we can solve for a guest problem arm in arm with a business partner, that creates value in total. And part of that is captured in that $1 billion, part of that is captured in a better guest experience overall. \nBrian Cornell: Let's see, right up front. \nRobert Ohmes: Robby Ohmes at BofA Securities. This might be a question for John Mulligan. The question is, you guys mentioned midsized stores and why not larger stores? And help me understand sortation centers and that's taking pressure off the stores. And so do you not need larger stores? And I think you mentioned that you can put a Target store kind of in any kind of real estate. And that's -- how does that work with the store-as-hub strategy? Because I would think you would need certain kind of real estate to do the stores as hubs. So just help me understand what you guys are doing. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Well, first, let me be clear. We will open up big stores if we find opportunities to open up big stores. No question. We're going to open a 144,000-square-foot store this year. We're excited about that. So we'll keep doing that.\n We went from big to small, almost exclusively small, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, maybe 30,000. Those are great sites. We'll continue to do that. We love those, one just a few blocks from here soon.\n What we're saying there's this middle ground that we haven't really built in the past. And Brian and I have walked in those. We built some 60,000, 70,000, 80,000, even 90,000-square-foot stores, a lot of old Kmarts. Love them. They're big enough that you get the entire Target experience, but the backroom is big enough so that we can do all of our digital fulfillment as well. So we get this great middle ground between the 2. And I think our message today is we can do all of that.\n Over the past few years, between our properties team, store design, construction, Christina's merchant team because assorting these stores is critical, getting the right assortment for the neighborhood to serve that community is incredibly important. We can do all of that. And so there are these opportunities now out there where you can get into a dense urban neighborhood, a dense suburban neighborhood with a 90,000-square-foot store, great. We'll do that all day long.\n I think the sort center, the great thing about that is it gets stuff out of the backroom faster. Much like we want to get the inventory on to the front of the store, which Mark's team has done an outstanding job over the last 2 years, we want the boxes out of the backroom. All of that creates capacity in the backroom, more pack stations, more volume, keep it moving, just keep things moving. And that's why the sort centers are so important to that strategy. But we'll do whatever from an opening perspective. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: It's Steph Wissink from Jefferies. I have a question for the panel more broadly, but it's really about headroom. I think you mentioned on a productivity basis, and one of the most impressive slides is the sales increase versus the number of stores. Talk about how much headroom you have from a productivity per box basis. And how does that factor into your growth algo? And then, Cara, I have a question for you. This is a fun one. But most searched-for brand or category that you don't currently carry that you would love to have. \nBrian Cornell: Michael? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. So John has talked in the past about the capacity we have to continue growing in stores. And the thing I'd come back to there is we've seen over the last couple of years how well stores and stores as hubs scale. I mean we've got productivity gains and productivity per foot gains across the chain. It's actually true that the biggest stores generated the biggest productivity gains over the last few years. And so that speaks to the headroom we're creating.\n We know the throughput we can get in stores. And if you kind of go through quartile by quartile in our stores, that implies we've got a lot of stores that could get a lot bigger before they tap out. And so we feel really good about the opportunity to keep growing the business. But stores as hubs is the thing that enables so much of that capacity. \nJohn Mulligan: I think the other thing I'd add on is as inventory turns increase with scale, you just push things through faster. Speed and flow of inventory is the key to the whole game, like we were just talking about with Robby. And as that happens, we see it in our largest stores, they just move inventory. It's constantly moving through. It shows up at night. It's out the store the next day. That's capacity. You're just moving inventory. So a lot of headroom for growth from that perspective. \nBrian Cornell: Cara, you want to tackle search, most popular item? \nCara Sylvester: So that's a fun one, too, Steph. Thanks for the question. I think our search terms and what the guest is looking for changes seasonally all the time, always seasonal products, always newness and always the hot items that are out there. And so we see a really close look at our search really on a weekly basis and work with our merchant partners to share back those insights.\n What I would tell you is over the years, the search insights, of course, are going to impact. And we're going to feed those over to the merchandising team for them as they're constantly looking for the right mix of our owned brand products and our national brand products. And so we'll continue to make sure we're feeding those over.\n Christina, is there anything you would add? \nA. Hennington: I think that's really well said. And you'd be surprised at how quickly those ebb and flow week by week as the consumer went through so much change over the year. And I think that's where the breadth of our multi-category portfolio has played to our advantage that, whether it's a mask they're looking for or Xbox or it's a new spring dress, we've been able to be there for them in all those moments. \nBrian Cornell: We've got a question towards the back. \nEdward Yruma: This is Ed Yruma from KeyBanc. Two quick ones from me. I guess, first, on the food assortment. You've done a very impressive job adding more food over the past couple of years. I guess as you think about the incremental share opportunity, are there more foods you can add? Do you think you can become that weekly grocery destination? And then as a follow-up, sometimes when you head into kind of a sticky consumer environment, we see trade down, focus on value. Are you seeing any of the leading indicators that the consumer is feeling pressured? \nBrian Cornell: Rick, why don't you start from a food standpoint, and then we'll come back to some of the consumer trends we're seeing right now. \nRichard Gomez: Sure. To talk about food, we, as I said before, have a lot of positive momentum on what we're seeing in the food business. We continue to see opportunity to continue to grow as we think about our assortment, and I would say that the real 3 key drivers of the growth that we see in the future.\n The first is the digital business, which is our same-day services. Industry-leading in general, but particularly relative to our competitive -- our grocery competitive set. It's a real step up, not only from an experience standpoint, from a convenience and ease perspective. I think John mentioned the NPS scores. It's a differentiator relative to other particularly grocers.\n The second thing that I would say is different about our assortment, which you mentioned and the competition is our owned brands. Good & Gather, only 2 years in and is already over $2 billion in sales. Favorite Day is brand new. It developed during the pandemic and is already off to a really strong start. And then we have Market Pantry, which is a little bit lower price point, but we think will be very relevant during these inflationary times. So we think that assortment of owned brands, when we stack it up to our competitors, they're growing faster than grocery industry private-label brands. We think that's the third -- the second key driver.\n And then the third, I think, will be seasons, and we talk about that a lot. But we -- whether it's Easter or Valentine's Day, Halloween, Mother's Day or upcoming Easter, that's where we do really, really well. And Easter is coming up, and I think Target's one of the few places where you can get everything you need for the holiday. You can get the eggs for Easter. You can get the candy for Easter. You can get the basket. You can get home decor and you can get the Easter dress. And I think that's a real competitive advantage for us, particularly versus a lot of our grocery competitors. \nBrian Cornell: And from a consumer standpoint, I'll start and I'll let Christina jump in. Let's go back to what we saw in the fourth quarter. And obviously, we saw comps up 9%, but it was driven by great traffic. And we saw a pretty balanced growth between both physical stores and digital. So we're clearly seeing a guest than a consumer who's shopping in both channels.\n As we sit here today, we're listening very closely to the consumer. And if there's anything, I think, we've learned over the last 2 years, it's just the resiliency we're seeing in the U.S. consumer environment. But specifically, we know consumers are still worried about COVID, yet they're looking for that touch of normal in their lives. And we saw that play out during the Super Bowl. Rick talked about some of the results we delivered. But that consumer and the Target guests, they wanted to be together with friends and family for the first time in a couple of years to enjoy the Super Bowl.\n We know we've got a consumer who is looking for value. But as Christina noted, they're looking for newness as well. And anything new is exciting and showing up in that basket. There's clearly inflationary concerns that are starting to pop up in the conversation. But it's still a U.S. consumer with a pretty healthy balance sheet.\n So we're going to have to watch this carefully. We know March, April are going to be important time frames as the consumer overlaps, some stimulus checks and child care. So we're taking a cautious approach to the first quarter. But we continue to see a very resilient consumer who has a solid balance sheet and is balancing that desire for value and concerns with inflation with a desire to find something new and just go back out and experience everyday life. \nJoseph Feldman: Joe Feldman, Telsey Advisory Group. Wanted to go back to the sortation centers. I may have missed, but how many do you plan for this year and then beyond? Like it seems like you may only need one per major market based on the map that you put up. But -- and then maybe the -- I don't know if you want to share the cost with us but to build it, to hire people, all of that would be great. \nJohn Mulligan: Joe, you know us better than that. We will -- by the end of next week or next month, we will have 6 of them open. We're thinking probably 5 more later this year. And of course, part of this little unknown, same supply chain problems that have impacted our ability to remodel and open new stores, things are slower, permits are slower, everything slower. We'll see. But that's where we're headed. And we think there's an opportunity over the next 4 or 5 years to continue to build at least that pace, perhaps a little bit faster. But when you look at the major or urban areas across the country, lots of opportunity.\n And I wouldn't say, in the case of many cities, it will not be just one per city. Just the way you navigate some cities and the way they're carved up makes that harder to do. And so the opportunity for us to do several in the city is there for us. But that's all down the road. So you'll see us continue to build into it. \nBrian Cornell: We probably have time for 2 more questions, so let me make sure we get some new hands. \nKelly Bania: Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Question about the longer-term operating income outlook. I think, Michael, you mentioned you'll welcome the rate growth when it happens for the right reasons. So maybe just help us understand what are those right reasons. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I think the last 2 years are pretty instructive. The rate growth we saw over the last 2 years came from scale benefits. That's a more sustainable version of rate growth. But to be clear, that's not the number in the P&L we're optimizing for. It's profit dollar growth over time. We'd expect to find the fuel to fund the investments to power the top line, and that's kind of the thing that's at the heart of the algorithm. But when we see sustainable rate growth, we'll welcome it just like you saw over the last couple of years. \nGregory Melich: Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. A follow-up and then my question. The follow-up is AUR. This year, if we think with inflation out there, how do you think AUR plays out this year in that guide in terms of traffic and ticket or units? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I don't know if my crystal ball is that clear, Greg. But the story that we've really seen most recent quarter to start with is the incredible growth in traffic. There's some puts and takes in basket, but virtually all of our growth in Q4 came from traffic. So we'll -- as you heard today, we'll continue to be focused on protecting value and making sure that our price position is strong, and that's working. It's leading to deepening engagements, it's leading to more trips to Target.\n And so where exactly AUR lands over the course of the year, I think, is going to be a journey we'll all take together, and we'll see. But traffic has been the story for us. \nGregory Melich: Still the traffic. And then maybe a 3P fulfillment. You've mentioned a little bit about extending the aisle with some vendors, with Roundel doing well. I guess I'd like to understand, what is the right assortment for Target both in-store and online? Do we want to get to 10 million SKUs? Do we need to? Is it curated? Are we selling Roundel services to trusted vendors as opposed to United Airlines? How do we think about that? \nBrian Cornell: Christina, I might ask you to start. And Cara, I know you've got a point of view on this topic. \nA. Hennington: Yes. First and foremost, our point of view on assortment is all about curation. It's making sure that we understand the consumer and that we can craft an assortment that starts with a balance of really well-designed, high-quality and value owned brands, coupled with the leading national brands that consumers would expect to find. By having a curated assortment, it fuels the stores-as-hubs model because there isn't this long extension that we have to fulfill from other parts of the network. We're using the inventory base of the stores, which creates efficiencies, which creates speed, which creates lower costs.\n Additionally, we think it's a guest benefit. The ability to navigate the assortment and navigate the paradox of choice is real. And so creating options that are much more relevant in a more tight environment is important to us, and that extends to our marketplace.\n And so Cara can talk a little bit more about how we think about that, but it's really a complement hand in glove. \nCara Sylvester: Absolutely. And it's in lockstep with our merchant partners. And our marketplace is truly differentiated because it is invite-only, and it will remain invite-only as we think through who are the right trusted partners that we are looking to actually complement our assortment with.\n And then just a comment on your Roundel question, similar story there. That growth that I talked about of getting to $1 billion is largely with our vendor partners who are finding incredible value within the guest data and insights that we have. And we see a lot of headroom to grow with those trusted vendor partners as we think through the coming years ahead. \nBrian Cornell: So I'll wrap up from here. And I want to start by thanking all of you for joining us in person. We've really been looking forward to this. It's been a long couple of years. I hope you walk away with a clear sense of our direction as a company, the strategies that will guide us going forward, the capabilities we'll continue to invest in, the important role that our team will play and the unique culture that I believe really defines and separates us from many of our peers. So I hope you leave recognizing we are committed to being a growth company, one that is a profitable growth company for years to come, great stewards of capital and will provide great returns for shareholders. But I really appreciate your time, your engagement today. And we look forward to seeing you again in person next year. So thanks for joining us. Stay well. Stay safe. We hope to see you again soon.",

            "name": "Mark Schindele",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. One of the best parts about my job is getting to spend time with our team every week in stores across the country. And I hear stories like those we just shared in the video, stories about what Target means to our team. And there's no doubt that our more than 300,000 store team members, who interact with our guests every day, are Target's biggest asset and our single-greatest differentiator. They inspire me as they bring our purpose to life every single day. \n And I'm excited to talk about them and what they do, including ways that may not show up on the balance sheet. Take Terence, for example. He's a team member in our Fairview Heights, Illinois store who stopped what he was doing to help change a guest's flat tire in our parking lot. Her response, \"He's my hero. I'll be looking for him every time I go in that store just to tell him how special he is.\" Or [ Manu ], a leader in our Maui store, who helped the elderly community in the remote town of Hana. She partnered with a local nonprofit to help them get the essentials they needed when they couldn't make it to the store in person. \n Our team is there to help our guests every day, handing them clean carts as they walk in our front doors, helping them find that perfect item on the shelf, dropping their bags into their car or shipping orders out the back to their homes. They show up for local communities and each other day in and day out. And that's why when we set out to put our stores at the heart of everything we do, it was clear that the most important investment we could make was in our team. \n We know an engaged team is more productive and creates a better experience for our guests. And over the last year, we've invested in wages, debt-free education and made even more of our team eligible for health benefits. We've also focused on desired hours and more reliable schedules through one-on-one conversations with our team, and we have an ongoing commitment to develop our team to get to wherever they want to go. \n We've also seen great growth in our new on-demand scheduling option we introduced this year, with more than 35,000 team members already signed up. It's a perfect opportunity for those team members who mainly want a couple of shifts a month or a college student who wants to work over the holiday season when she's back over winter break. Together, our investments and consistent hours for our team and the flexibility of on-demand models help us deliver for our guests while supporting the diverse needs of our team. \n Even as the U.S. labor market is seeing some of the highest turnover on record, our rate in Target stores remains below pre-pandemic levels. Our stores are fully staffed, and we've been able to leverage the training and the tenure of our team to easily shift against demand without missing a beat.\n Let's talk about the experience we're delivering for our guests. Target is the easiest place for our guests to get everything they need, no matter how they choose to shop. Even in a year as unpredictable as 2021, we saw satisfaction rise with gains in many of our most important drivers of guest experience, like interacting with our team on the sales floor and wait time at checkout. In fact, over the past 2 years, our already impressive overall Net Promoter Score increased more than 10%, a true testament to our team's commitment to service.\n In every store from the register, the Drive Up lane, our team is building loyalty with guests, offering ease, convenience and incredible service that keeps them coming back. For example, more than 60% of our new Drive Up guests return to use it again that month. And when a guest tries a new same-day service for the first time, they spend more at Target going forward, including in our stores. And last year, more than half of our digital sales came from our same-day services.\n In the year ahead, we'll fuel that momentum, deepening our trust with our guests with an experience our competitors can't match. That means clean, bright and on-brand floors that invite discovery, inspire guests with the latest products, all brought to life by an incredible team, a team that's empowered and trained across the building so they can jump in wherever our guests need us.\n And we've developed a flexible framework of service so every single team member can engage and connect and problem-solve with guests across the store. We'll continue to backup train every new team member on same-day services so we can easily adjust for peaks and in-store pickup. And we're offering continuous learning and development moments throughout the year in key categories and new brands.\n We know operational excellence and service go hand in hand, so we're focused on nailing the fundamentals and making shopping at Target easy and special for our guests. Take a look. \n [Presentation] In nearly 2,000 communities across the country, our Target team provides great in-store experience and easy fulfillment options. With same-day services already at scale from coast to coast, we are ready for when guest shopping behavior changed. And as we've seen demand grow, our team is able to support that growth and accelerate our progress to meet guests' needs along the way.\n In the past year, we've added adult beverage and expanded our assortment for pickup. We built in more personalized features like sending a friend or a family member when plans change, choosing where you'd like your order placed in your car or selecting a backup option if something's out of stock. We even doubled the amount of Drive Up parking spaces in the holiday season so guests could get those last-minute gifts without leaving their cars.\n Our guests love our same-day services, and they provide great cost savings of nearly 90% per unit compared to shipping from an upstream warehouse. In the year ahead, we'll keep improving Order Pickup and Drive Up offerings with a focus on quality, speed and great service. We'll continue to expand the assortment available, and we'll add the Backup Item functionality to even more categories. In the months since we rolled out this option, our teams are able to substitute the Backup Items 98% of the time.\n Everything we do at Target is grounded in making our guests' daily lives even easier. We want every Target run to be fast, convenient and rewarding, and that includes the return process. Our teams are building the capability to accept returns from the Drive Up lane with plans to test later this year. So guests will be able to check everything out their shopping list and return a product that wasn't quite right at the same time and without leaving the car.\n And lastly, I'm really excited we're going to pilot the ability to order Starbucks for Drive Up so guests can get everything on their list and request their morning latte when they're on the way while never even unbuckling their seatbelt. We'll take a test-and-learn approach in select markets throughout the summer and fall with a goal of eventually making this option available from coast to coast.\n To bring these enhancements to life and continue strengthening our operations, our team is working to streamline on the back end, even further integrating the omnichannel experience into how we run and staff our stores. Now, of course, nothing at Target happens in a vacuum, so we're working with partners from across the organization, from tech and digital to supply chain and properties, to support these capabilities. The ability of our store teams to ship local orders out our back doors continues to increase our speed to guests while delivering cost savings of more than 40% per unit versus upstream shipping.\n We're working closely with our supply chain partners as we roll out more sortation centers across the country. As you heard from John, we're excited about the efficiencies they'll continue adding to our ship-from-store operation. Frequent sweeps of our stores to a local sortation center frees up space in our backrooms, and centralizing the sorting process helps our team be more productive and saves valuable time.\n Our teams are focused on greater ease and efficiency with store staffing, especially when it comes to same-day options, so we can be ready to flex with guest demand. We're enhancing our technology to give store leaders an even clear real-time picture of fulfillment needs and testing out new tools to help them better predict guest patterns in the future, helping us be even more efficient in staffing, the right teams at the right times, ready to do the work and deliver for our guests.\n We're making upgrades to physical spaces that support these services, remodeling our stores with more hold capacity, adding dedicated doors with easy access to the exterior. We're adding more Drive Up spaces to our parking lots, and we're even adding some camps in stores that get bad weather. Also our teams can get orders to guests quickly and safely every time.\n And inside our stores, we're making improvements to the process itself to make things even easier for our team and better for our guests, like finding the most efficient ways to pick orders from how we deploy the team members, to technology that helps reduce footsteps throughout the store, all with the goal of continuing to deliver the ease and convenience our guests expect.\n Our solid operational foundation and stores-as-hub model has allowed Target to be there for our guests even when the world shifted around us, and they'll continue to be the engines of our growth. That foundation is made even stronger by the deep roots of empathy and care and everything our teams do to keep us moving forward together.\n And before I turn it over to Rick, I can't miss the opportunity to say thank you to our team. With stores at the center of how we serve guests across the country, they've risen to every challenge with care, resilience and flexibility, not only meeting guest needs today but ensuring we'll be ready for them tomorrow. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Brian. John shared a bit about how we're adding scale in our stores. And a couple of things I'd like to add in, when we think about our same-day services, that business just continues to grow. And that example of putting an extra box on the shelf also plays out in same-day service where you can grab an extra bag. And as we see our baskets grow, our trip frequency grows, our productivity grows.\n And we've said it often, but our most important investment we can make is in our team, and our team is doing an incredible job executing and delivering scale and efficiency every single day and creating that incredible experience for our guests."

            "name": "Cara Sylvester",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. I'm excited to be here to share a view of Target's growth through our guest' eyes, because as Christina shared, everything we do should be rooted in a deep understanding of what our guests want, along with the empathy to understand what they need and how those needs continue to evolve. In the next few minutes, I want to show you how our commitment to relevance has positioned Target to deliver the most personalized omnichannel experience in retail. \n In my first year as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer, I've had the privilege of sharing Target's story in many virtual firesides, roundtables and interviews. And the common thread, when I think about all of those times, is that people always ask me how Target stays 3 steps ahead with our guests in these rapidly changing times. And while I am not a huge fan of giving away all the keys to success, I always point to our culture of care and our core value of inclusivity that have us listening and learning from our guests deeply and continuously. \n When our insights team talks with guests, we don't just ask them questions about Target and their experiences shopping with us. Guests share their hopes with us, their fears and their dreams. They share simply what's going on in their lives. Through these ongoing check-ins, every area of our enterprise has a view of the holistic human experience lived by our guests during the pandemic and what that might mean for Target in the future. \n We also know from brand research what matters most to guests when they shop and connect with us. Ease and affordability are essential, but our guests are looking for more, too: quality and value, community and connection, inclusivity and feeling seen, what Brian calls the power of 'and'. And what gets me really excited is how we're delivering loud and proud on these personal guest values at scale. \n Target's digital experience, which we have been investing in for years, plays a key role here as a gateway to our guests and a huge growth driver for us. Our digital business has nearly tripled in the last 2 years and in 2021 delivered a 20% comp on top of a 145% comp the year prior. Then there's 45% comp growth in digitally enabled same-day services on top of 235% last year. And our flagship Target app has moved from 30% of digital demand a little over 2 years ago to closing in on 70% today. \n But the biggest differentiator when you look at Target's digital experience, it is designed with guests at the center. We take the friction out so that guests can experience Target on their own terms, which means we are guest-obsessing at every touch point to stay a step ahead of evolving guest behaviors. For example, we're leaning into the love our guests have for our digitally led same-day services because that's sticking. Routines developed early in the pandemic are now part of their lives, things they cannot live without. But they look a little bit different today. \n So here's a guest who had a Drive Up border, our highest NPS service, but then she was drawn inside to discover something new. Then there's this guest who said, \"Can we just talk about the fact that you can go through Target with Starbucks at hand and then go through Ulta?\" These new kinds of Target runs and stock-ups reflect our guests' evolving needs and wants and a seamless omnichannel experience that delivers on them. \n Today, Target has 40 million guests in counting shopping across channels. And as you've heard us share before, omnichannel guests spend 4x as much as stores-only guests and even more compared to digital-only guests. Target can bring together insights across an omnichannel journey, from RedCard and registry, to digital and in-store, to our call centers and every step in between, which means we're getting a 360-degree view of the kind of guests that are driving so much growth. \n With these meaningful insights, we can make sure that Target Magic they love is even more relevant in their lives and the experience even more personalized. So you can imagine what this looks like. For one guest scrolling through the app, what she sees is curated especially for her. There's her favorite items and great deals on her go-to essentials for weeknight dinners. And because she told us she's a teacher, it really means something to her when she sees a Target Circle offer that makes her classroom supplies more affordable. \n She's getting ideas for what to pack in lunchboxes for her kids this week, too, maybe a little something from Good & Gather. And what's more, her app experience helps make life easier as someone who might need a shopping partner once in a while. That's our name for a new service that allows her husband to do the Target run while she's working, a service that is near and dear to my family's heart. So she checks out and later that afternoon, he picks up what's for dinner. \n Here's another kind of personalized guest journey that we're obsessing over. A guest is shopping for essentials when he sees a message from a banner ad about Clorox' Glad bags. He's purchased them before, but other brands, too. The headline benefits really resonate with him. So this time, he adds Glad to his cart. He checks out and drives up. Purchases like this one contributed to a 40% higher return on ad spend for Clorox and a 25% increase in customer retention over the duration of the campaign. \n Let me share the back story on this type of Target run. At the start of the pandemic, Clorox saw growth in guests buying their products for the first time, and they wanted to retain them. So they turn to our media company, Roundel, to measure guest values and behaviors. Using that research, Roundel developed a series of A/B tests, and Clorox used those key insights to optimize messaging and audience targeting. \n How we're leveraging media to know our guests better and create a more relevant and personalized experience for them is incredibly exciting, and so is this. From its humble beginnings in 2007 with just 5 team members and known as online vendor marketing, Roundel is now a 500-plus person strong fully integrated Target team, already delivering more than $1 billion in value for Target, and we expect that to grow to $2 billion over the next several years. \n To sum up Roundel, it's positioned for continued success because it's delivering on relevance and value. That's a win-win-win for Target, for our partners and for our guests. \n Now I'd say the same thing about Target Plus. Target Plus is different than other marketplaces. It's invite-only with vetted partners we have relationships with who are extending our aisles digitally. And because of our trusted and curated assortment, our guests aren't sifting through thousands of pages of results for the one thing that's going to bring them joy. In fact, Target Plus is so seamless on the things that matter, the ease of the experience, a relevant assortment and the benefits of RedCard and in-store returns, the majority of guests don't know they're shopping with marketplace. It feels like Target. It feels personal, and the love for marketplace is only growing. In 2021, Target Plus grew 75%. \n So let's take a look through our guests' eyes. In Target stores, our assortment of sunglasses features a curated set of options designed to meet the wants and needs of a broad set of families. For this guest, though, who's purchased Goodfellow shades to keep at home, at work, in his car, he's thinking about splurging for his upcoming vacation. The RayBan aviator he's looking for our online, and he's over the moon about the RedCard savings as he makes the purchase from our partner, Luxottica. And when he decides on a pair -- different pair that will frame his face even better, it's easy enough to stop by the store and let us handle the returns. \n With rich insights from omnichannel experiences, we're able to serve up even more deals that guests want, more suggestions of services they've never thought of, more ways to support brands and nonprofits close to their hearts. \n And that brings me to Target Circle, which I'm really excited to talk about. So here's a lesser engaged guests who joined Circle through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. She's able to seamlessly link her Ultimate Rewards account for Circle for all of the benefits. She's thrilled that she can now find her favorite skin care brand and her go-to mascara at her local Target store. And I want to pause here for just a second. \n Christina told us about how we're off to a great start with the Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops. But let's recognize how that partnership is translating to digital and loyalty with our guests. We're getting to know these guests in Circle, leading to more personalized experiences that are serving up the things they crave. And back to this guest, other things she may love, like Wild Fable. So in such a short time, someone who only shopped occasionally is now on the path to super fandom. \n Circle is a way for us to deeply understand our guests and have a 2-way connection with them. And in addition to the fact that in less than 3 years, it's become one of the biggest retail loyalty programs in the United States with 100 million members and growing. It's also one of the new ways we're creating relevance at scale with a strategic shift from mass promotional offers to personalized. \n During holiday, personalized offers showed an $8 to $10 lift in promotional basket size compared to mass offers and a conversion rate of 70% versus 40%. In addition to the personalized deals curated for them and the fact that they can vote and support local nonprofits important to them, I have to call out our guests' love for Target Circle Bonus. Our new gamification platform personalizes missions and rewards members. And it's already delivering big for our business, resulting in nearly $200 million in incremental sales in 2021. And as you're hearing repeatedly today, we're just getting started. \n So I've shared lots of examples about how we're meeting our guests' needs and wants throughout their omnichannel journey, but this one stands out as a point of pride. In the past, we've run a Black History Month campaign for the month of February. But now through our digital platforms, we've grown towards an always-on, deeply relevant approach. So Target guests can shop and support Black-owned founders and entrepreneurs all year round through Black Beyond Measure and Latino-owned brands, and women-owned brands, and Asian-owned brands, and so many more personalized and inclusive experiences where guests feel seen and heard every day. \n Here's one more. Let's take a look at a new spot from our brand campaign, What We Value Most Shouldn't Cost More.  \n [Presentation] There's a lot of good to see here. But it's not just what the guest sees, it's also about what's happening behind the scenes that makes all guests feel seen. We're partnering with diverse content creators in new ways from production crews to on-site catering in front of and behind the camera. Every part of the marketing ecosystem reflects our forward values. And this is so important. We are walking the walk in terms of our investments. By the end of the year, we're committing 5% of our annual media spend to Black-owned media partners and another 5% to Hispanic-owned media partners. Because equity, opportunity and inclusivity are core to who we are, they show up authentically in our omnichannel experience, and our guests are responding to that. \n This guest feels seen. In stationery, she feels a sense of belonging and inclusion when she holds a heartfelt message in Braille. And we brought him joy. Let's close with his journey. \n [Presentation] So no matter where you look in our omnichannel experience up at the Cat & Jack sign in store or online, the relevant connections we have with our guests are making a positive difference in their lives within our communities and for our business, and we're never going to stop. \n Now I'm delighted to introduce my friend and team member, John Mulligan. Yes. It's incredibly exciting to talk about the Roundel story. And the Roundel business is not a new business for us. And we've actually been able to scale it quite quickly over the last several years by really being differentiated by focusing truly at the gas at the center. And what we find is that our vendor partners love partnering with us around Roundel given those guest insights. And they -- we've been able to actually keep the guests at the center and scale that to $1 billion. We're looking to scale that even quicker to $2 billion over the next couple of years by again being truly differentiated in partnering with our vendor partners. They find incredible value in partnering with us on those guest insights.\n Michael, do you want to talk a little bit about the financials, how they roll through? So that's a fun one, too, Steph. Thanks for the question. I think our search terms and what the guest is looking for changes seasonally all the time, always seasonal products, always newness and always the hot items that are out there. And so we see a really close look at our search really on a weekly basis and work with our merchant partners to share back those insights.\n What I would tell you is over the years, the search insights, of course, are going to impact. And we're going to feed those over to the merchandising team for them as they're constantly looking for the right mix of our owned brand products and our national brand products. And so we'll continue to make sure we're feeding those over.\n Christina, is there anything you would add? Absolutely. And it's in lockstep with our merchant partners. And our marketplace is truly differentiated because it is invite-only, and it will remain invite-only as we think through who are the right trusted partners that we are looking to actually complement our assortment with.\n And then just a comment on your Roundel question, similar story there. That growth that I talked about of getting to $1 billion is largely with our vendor partners who are finding incredible value within the guest data and insights that we have. And we see a lot of headroom to grow with those trusted vendor partners as we think through the coming years ahead."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. This morning, I'm eager to give you a peek behind the curtain to answer the question, what's next for Target? And the short answer is a lot. I'd like to share with you a deeper look into the growth framework we use to drive our strategies forward. With a fortified foundation and the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests, we're continuing to build what's working strategically while making smart choices to launch new initiatives. \n While I plan to spend most of my time today sharing our specific strategies and the lens through which we view them. Let's first acknowledge what enables the execution of these strategies in the first place: our team, our operations and technology. The investments we've made in these areas will empower everything we'll share today. In fact, they're increasingly becoming differentiated growth drivers in their own rights, and they propel our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. And at the center of that purpose, you see our guests. Everything we do should be rooted in a deep understanding of what our guests want, along with empathy to understand what they need. \n Our culture to care, grow and win together, coupled with our core values of inclusivity, connection and drive, support our purpose. Without them, our purpose statement is just words on the page. It's only when we're aligned in who we are, what we care about and how we drive forward together that our purpose comes to life. \n Here's a recent example. One of our guests, Nicholas, recently lost his sister to cancer. One of his family's most prized possessions was a photo his sister in an opal-housed picture frame that she gave to him before she passed. One day, the frame fell and shattered. Unable to find a replacement, Nicholas reached out to us with a plea for help. The frame, unfortunately, was no longer in production. But the owned brand team tracked down 2 remaining frames, which they sent to Nicholas and his wife, complete with handwritten notes of sympathy and care from the Target team. \n Nicholas shared with the team, \"I know it's just a frame, but there's a lot of meaning behind it. What you did may seem small, but it represents so much more.\" This is just one example of how our team continuously shows up, living out our values and putting care first. I am so grateful for their unwavering commitment to our guests, the communities they serve and each other, all in service of our purpose. \n So now let's go deeper into each of our 6 strategic pillars, distinct but interwoven aspects of how we intend to grow. They represent core ideas to create forward motion for our business and help define the sum of the parts that is uniquely Target. Let's begin with one of the most iconic differentiators at Target, our brands. Through our careful balance of exclusive owned brands and industry-leading national brands, Target differentiates by curating a unique assortment, driving preference in a crowded retail landscape. We built guest affinity through our flagship brands like Good & Gather, All in Motion, Cat & Jack and Threshold. We've also continued to innovate with new brands such as Brightroom, Target's first dedicated storage and home organization owned brand; and Kindful, our first pet food brand with premium ingredients and no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. \n Through our world-class design and sourcing functions, we are able to develop and produce products adding incredible quality and value, always a focus for our guests, but never more so than in an inflationary environment. To illustrate the scale of our owned brands, in 2021 alone, Target sold more than 330 million units in Cat & Jack, equating to nearly 7 items for every child in the United States under the age of 11. And even though these brands are already big, they're still growing. In fact, Target's owned brands grew 18% in 2021. And at more than $30 billion, our owned brand sales alone now rival the size of some Fortune 100 companies. \n But as we've said before, it isn't about owned or national brands. The harmony created between them is part of what makes Target unique. Our recent progress in denim serves as a perfect example. Years ago, we recognized a vast opportunity to elevate denim's role at Target, stemming from considerable guests and market research. So when Universal Thread and Goodfellow launched, both featured extensive new denim offerings, including a variety of styles and inclusive sizing, all at sharp price points. The guest reaction was to the quality and value was fantastic. \n We further rounded out the assortment by deepening our partnership with Levi's, which continues to grow. All told, the interplay between our owned and national brands has reinvigorated this category, bringing us from a retailer that sold denim to a denim destination, having grown sales in this category by more than $150 million since 2019. \n And Levi's isn't the only growing partnership at Target. We're also deepening our relationship with leading national brand partners like Disney, Apple and Ulta Beauty. Brian touched on the strong results we're seeing with our first 100 Ulta Beauty at Target stores. We entered this partnership knowing our guests were looking for prestige beauty brands and industry-leading expertise, and that's exactly what these new shops are delivering. \n In stores where we've added an Ulta Beauty experience, guests are buying incremental items from the Ulta Beauty assortment while continuing to shop the beauty brands they loved at Target for years. In fact, these new spaces average more than 2x the productivity of the rest of the store, and the growth is proving to be incremental. Specifically, in stores that have added an Ulta Beauty section, we're seeing a mid-teens lift across total Beauty and productivity lifts in complementary categories as well. With these incredible results, we remain committed to operating at least 800 Ulta Beauty at Target locations over time with plans to add more than 250 new locations in 2022. \n At Target, we pride ourselves on the level of service and shopping experience we provide. As John and Mark will share in more detail, we made meaningful investments and progress in the store shopping experience over the past several years. So I'll focus on our opportunity to grow our in-store services. \n Target has long been a destination and escape, largely because of the differentiated experience we provide. In-store services are one more way we can make life easier for our guests, helping them to accomplish more in a single trip to their local store. Years ago, we began our partnership with CVS Health to provide pharmacy services in our stores, and they continue to deliver exceptional care and expertise today. This not only benefits our guests who fulfill their prescriptions in our stores but also consolidates another trip, simplifying their lives. \n Similarly, we provide convenient, well-established optical services, which we have at more than 500 of our stores and growing. Yet we still have an opportunity to do more. Let me share an example of a recent pilot we plan to scale. In 2021, Target began testing ear piercing at several Minneapolis-based stores. Our research found that guests were looking for a reliable, safe and convenient place to get their families' ears pierced. So we created a joyful and differentiated experience, making us the first-and-only national retailer to offer ear piercings performed by a licensed nurse. This service helps us connect and celebrate a major milestone with often younger guests, creating lasting affinity for our brand. \n Given the success of the pilot, we recently expanded the rollout to nearly 200 stores with plans to meaningfully increase that number by the end of 2022. This is a fantastic example of what happens when we listen to our guests, deeply research the market opportunities and create a differentiated solution. \n Another growth pillar is our focus on affordability as value remains among the biggest loyalty builders in retail. Our goal is to deliver unbeatable value by providing affordability across every category every day. After all, we established our Expect More, Pay Less promise decades ago, and we're continuously evolving what it means to deliver great value. \n Given that the U.S. economy is experiencing the highest inflation rate in decades, the American consumer is becoming increasingly price-conscious. This is why we believe our comprehensive view of affordability, which focuses on price but encompasses so much more, sets Target apart from our competitors, driving deepened engagement and growing loyalty. Our guests tell us that affordability begins with price, but also includes proximity, accessibility and assortment choices that satisfy any budget. \n It also means receiving valuable benefits like those we offer through Target Circle, including exclusive promotions and deals, 1% earnings to redeem on future purchases and the ability to help direct Target's charitable-giving to the causes our guests care most about; and the industry-leading benefits we offer with our RedCard holders, including 5% of every transaction, free shipping on Target.com and no annual membership fees. Over the years, RedCard guests have saved more than $9 billion on their purchases, including more than $1 billion in 2021 alone. \n Now I'd like to share a bit more about 2 emerging growth pillars in our framework. While they represent more nascent opportunities, they are positioned to spur incremental growth on top of our existing strategies. The first is our focus on relevance, something we've long worked to maintain and grow with every guest interaction. Brian shared the compelling opportunity we have to better harness and apply the power of guest insights. Through this opportunity, we can optimize our assortment, more effectively make offers to our guests and, most importantly, personalize our interactions with them. We've long known the joint value we can create for our vendors, our guests and Target by connecting guests to the products they want and need. \n But as we continue to deepen our relationship with the guests, our ability to refine and elevate this value is extraordinary and will continue to drive outsized growth over the next several years through the likes of Target Circle, Roundel and Target Plus. Carol will provide more detail on these rapidly growing platforms in a moment. \n Finally, I want to highlight Target Forward, the newest chapter in a long history of strong corporate responsibility at our company. At a time when the American consumer is becoming increasingly focused on not just what they buy but also where and how the product was made, how its production impacts the world and those who produced it, and how companies function as citizens of a global community, we are proud of our bold commitments to better people in the planet with every choice we make. \n As we grow and continue to develop our new owned brands, our Target Forward commitment is to design and elevate circular, sustainable brands. Of course, these brands will begin with a focus on our guests but also consider the impact to the world. We aspire for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future by 2040. \n Additionally, our teams will continue designing to eliminate waste, using materials that are regenerative, recycled or sourced sustainably to create products that are more durable, easily repaired or recyclable as well. Beyond our sustainability efforts, our aspirations to accelerate opportunity equity are equally pivotal. While we still have far to go, Target's Reach Committee is encouraged to be leading the industry with progress against virtually every goal we have set forth. We'll continue to share specific progress over time, but I want to highlight a few examples with you today. \n The first is in our Beauty business, where we have increased our black-owned or founded brands by 65% since 2020, and are now leading the industry with more than 70 black-owned and founded brands. Some of these entrepreneurs launched through Target's accelerator programs designed to quickly scale brands at Target.  \n Entrepreneur Cora Miller of the Black-owned Hair Care business, Young King Hair Care, went through our 2020 Target Takeout program and subsequently launched in 365 Target stores. Given the immediate success and reaction from our guests, we now have plans to expand this line into significantly more stores in 2022. Cora is among a group of fewer than 100 Black female entrepreneurs to raise more than $1 million in venture funds ever. We want Cora's story to become the rule, not the exception. We'll continue to elevate entrepreneurs like her through Accelerator programs, including the recently launched Forward Founders program, which equips historically under-resourced entrepreneurs to build their businesses and gain access to industry-leading retail resources and partnerships.  \n When more than half of our first cohort comprised of Black entrepreneurs, we aim to provide a launching point for many new and emerging Black-owned businesses. If we've proven anything over the last few years, it's that Target's a growth company. Even though we're now more than a $100 billion business, the opportunities for growth are immense. \n We have created momentum through unique and innovative strategies, many of which began long before the onset of the pandemic. And because of our durable, flexible business model, we have proven we can adapt to any environment. We'll continue to play offense and accelerate these strategies while listening to the ever-changing wants and needs of our guests to ensure our playbook is a direct reflection of what they have come to expect from Target. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Cara, who will provide more color on some of our powerful growth strategies. Yes, I'd be happy to. First of all, we have seen a sustained growth over a multiyear period. That's been led across the entirety of the portfolio. We've seen this past year alone double-digit growth in every single one of our key 5 merchandising areas.\n The other thing is, and Cara talked about this quite a bit, but the depth of engagement of the consumer leading to more trip frequency is what we believe will have continued sustainable growth, let alone all the initiatives we talked about. We're just in the beginning of our rollout of some of these national brand partnerships that are adding meaningful productivity, trip consolidation and opportunity for growth. So it's a paradigm that we've seen proven out over the last 2 years and is continuing to give us the confidence that that's going to drive growth going forward. I think that's really well said. And you'd be surprised at how quickly those ebb and flow week by week as the consumer went through so much change over the year. And I think that's where the breadth of our multi-category portfolio has played to our advantage that, whether it's a mask they're looking for or Xbox or it's a new spring dress, we've been able to be there for them in all those moments. Yes. First and foremost, our point of view on assortment is all about curation. It's making sure that we understand the consumer and that we can craft an assortment that starts with a balance of really well-designed, high-quality and value owned brands, coupled with the leading national brands that consumers would expect to find. By having a curated assortment, it fuels the stores-as-hubs model because there isn't this long extension that we have to fulfill from other parts of the network. We're using the inventory base of the stores, which creates efficiencies, which creates speed, which creates lower costs.\n Additionally, we think it's a guest benefit. The ability to navigate the assortment and navigate the paradox of choice is real. And so creating options that are much more relevant in a more tight environment is important to us, and that extends to our marketplace.\n And so Cara can talk a little bit more about how we think about that, but it's really a complement hand in glove."

            "name": "Richard Gomez",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. I am proud to be here today representing Target's Food & Beverage team because getting to $20 billion in sales last year, delivering double-digit growth on top of 2020's double-digit growth, achieving millions of dollars in market share gains and becoming America's fourth-biggest digital grocer and being named Retailer of the Year by Supermarket News, well, none of that happened by chance.\n As some of you know, we've been on a journey when it comes to groceries at Target. Food has always played an important role in driving trips and basket size, but we knew we could do so much more in this space. Today, Target is a company that doesn't just sell food. We are a company that celebrates food with a grocery business that's driving trips and basket size and, even more importantly, loyalty. It's become part of the differentiated experience that separates Target from the pack.\n Now before joining Target's marketing team back in 2013, I spent my entire career working for iconic food and beverage brands. That experience taught me that food and beverage is a business that is deeply personal for consumers, and that's what our team is delivering at Target. Central to our success is the fact that what we're doing is 100% unapologetically Target. That means we're not copying competitors or trying to do something we're not. Instead, we're listening to our guests, and we're leaning into what's special about Target: to provide a better experience at a great value. That's led to amazing results, a deeper sense of loyalty from our guests and the opportunity to do even more.\n A great example of this is our digital business. It's hard to believe, but just 2 years ago, fresh and frozen order pickup in-store and curbside was just a small test in a few markets. But when the pandemic hit, we knew we had to accelerate our plans to meet guests' fast-pacing changing needs. So in a matter of just a few months, we installed refrigerators and freezers for order pickup in hundreds of stores nationwide. We trained thousands of team members to pick online grocery orders. And we rolled out new marketing to raise awareness that if you're looking for safe, quick, easy option for getting your groceries and essentials, that's, by the way, free with no order minimum requirement, well, then Target is your place.\n When you think about the power of team, there are a few better examples than how in the middle of the pandemic and amidst of peak-level sales, we mobilized teams from across the company to undertake this monumental body of work because it was the right thing to do for our guests, and it was the right thing to do for our business. It really has been a game changer for so many families looking to limit trips outside their homes and into stores. And it has revolutionized our food and beverage experience, turning Target into an omnichannel grocery powerhouse.\n And we'll continue to make our pickup service even better. For instance, since launching Fresh and Frozen Pickup, we've also added Adult Beverage Pickup to about 80% of our stores. And I am so excited about what Mark just shared with Starbucks as part of our Drive Up experience.\n But it's important to recognize that there's still a lot of potential in front of us. But even as guests have started reclaiming some of their routines, including making more trips into our target stores, our digital business, fueled by Shipt, and our Order Pickup services, continues to grow.\n Look at the numbers. At the end of 2019, our digital penetration in Food & Beverage was 2.3%. We ended 2020 at 9.6%. We closed 2021 at 13.2%. Our 2021 digital sales were up $900 million over 2020 and up by sixfold over 2019. Our Net Promoter Scores consistently show that guests love our digital services. So as we keep driving awareness and trial and adding new experiences, we anticipate continued growth.\n Another area we're driving awareness and trial has led to ongoing growth is in our owned brand assortment. Back in 2019, we rolled out our flagship-owned brand, Good & Gather. It was the largest owned brand launch ever. Today, it totals nearly 2,500 items across Food & Beverage and is helping change perceptions about the shopping experience at Target. It's affordable. It's delicious, and it's on trend. Whether you're looking for a quick easy Tuesday night dinner or something fun for entertaining during March Madness, Good & Gather is everything our guests have long expected from Target's owned brands. And today, its growth is outpacing the industry average for private-label brands.\n And there's more. Favorite Day, a new brand of craveable baked goods and treats that draws guests into the food aisles. For instance, some of you might have come to Target because their kindergartner lost a sneaker and she has gym class tomorrow. But while dad's there, he might as well reward himself with a container of Peanut Butter Monster Trail Mix for the home office.\n Now Target-owned brands are only part of the story. We are also elevating our assortment by diversifying our assortment because we know that representation is critical to ensuring that we are -- that our offering is relevant to all our guests. Now when we decided at the beginning of last year to accelerate our commitment to adding more Black-owned brands, we had a dozen in our Food & Beverage assortment. But by changing the way we work, working hard to build new relationships and by using our size and scale to help brands grow for success in mass retail, we'll end 2022 with more than 50 Black-owned brands in our Food & Beverage assortment.\n And we won't stop there. Because these brands don't just make us more relevant, they make our assortment better. A great example is McBride Sisters wine, a Black female-owned business. We actually started working with them back in 2018 with a small partnership in about 100 stores in the South. Today, McBride Sisters is available in over 1,200 stores; or Everything Legendary, a company one of our buyers saw on television and couldn't wait to work with. So the next morning, he picked up the phone, sparking a relationship that led to Everything Legendary becoming Target's first Black-owned, plant-based meat supplier.\n And Target has taken a strong position in coffee, a category where our guests have especially high expectations. Black & Bold is a 3.5-year-old company founded by 2 childhood friends, and they have put social impact at the center of their business model, giving 5% of their profit to support kids and underserved communities. It's a company that we knew is a perfect fit for Target. They were our first Black-owned coffee brand. Today -- well, today, they're available in 1,300 stores and online. The response has been amazing. I love the suite.\n Now you got to go to Target and by a Keurig and the Black-owned coffee, Black and Bold. That tweet also brings me to another key differentiator in Target: the role we play as part of Target's multi-category assortment. That's something that sets Target apart on everyday trips and especially around holidays and key seasonal moments. Target dominates holiday seasons because guests love that they can get everything they need at Target: Halloween candy and costumes; the Thanksgiving turkey and games for the kids while the adults are gathering in the kitchen or watching football; and, of course, everything you need to make Hannukah, Christmas, Kwanza, 3 Kings Day special, including our robust selection of gingerbread houses.\n And this trend is continuing in 2022 as we saw during the first big seasonal moment of this year, Valentine's Day. Through the power of the total Target experience, the way we innovate, including our new Favorite Day, Valentine's Sugar Cookie kits, building on Target's cachet and the gingerbread space, and the platform we provide for our national brand partners to do amazing things to grow their brands, our team came through with the kind of Valentine's Day experience that makes Target special. In fact, we delivered our biggest Valentine's Candy sales ever, and we did it by the close of business on February 13. We did it with a day to spare. And we reached another milestone on February 13, finishing the week with record sales for snacks ahead of the Super Bowl.\n And despite all of this, what's so exciting to our team is that there's still a lot of room for us to improve, grow and gain even more market share in food for years to come. For instance, our research shows that even our best guests underestimate the breadth of our assortment, thinking they can only get some of their groceries at Target. As we continue to raise awareness of our full offering and we get credit for what we are already doing and the value that we provide, well, that is a huge opportunity.\n You heard Christina talk earlier about accessibility and affordability. That's why the Digital Snap payment option we're rolling out this year is so important to Food & Beverage. It's going to make our entire experience, in-store and online, accessible to all families, allowing them to shop on their terms regardless of how they pay for their groceries. And as we move more product faster than ever through our distribution network, we are continuing to look for ways to move that product even faster. Some of our improvement will come from the way we work with our national brand suppliers, encouraging them to prioritize the growth opportunity that Target represents. We're also working to better utilize our food distribution centers to keep up with the fast-growing demand.\n We'll continue leveraging the power of our owned brands for everyday needs and big seasonal moments. And I'm excited that for the first time, we're going to have a holiday-themed Favorite Day assortment this year.\n And then there's Circle. It's especially crucial to what we're doing in food, raising awareness of our assortment and the value that we offer. As you heard from Cara, we are not done growing what's already one of America's biggest and most vibrant loyalty programs. And as our marketing team continues to build on the success of Circle, that's going to help our entire business, but especially Food & Beverage.\n We have a lot to be proud of. And there's a lot of opportunity, and yes, a lot of work in front of us. But when I think about the future, I'd say my optimism is rooted in our team. So before handing off to Michael, I'll close with one more thought on team. Over the last couple of years, we've hired scores of Food & Beverage directors and coordinators, people with immense expertise in the grocery industry who are helping us drive continuous improvement across our operations. \n A few weeks ago, I was visiting stores in Colorado, and I was talking to one of our coordinators, Bridget. I asked her why she joined Target. Now keep in mind, this is someone who joined us from another retailer, someone who already had a good job and was doing well in her career. But when I posed this question, the first thing she said goes to what Brian was talking about in his intro, she talked about culture. Bridget was willing to take a risk in her career to leave a situation that was pretty good and give Target a chance because of what she heard about being a part of this team.\n She told me a lot about the people she works with, the support she has to make decisions that are right for the guest and the partnership she has with team members working in other categories. Bridget told me it was everything I hope for and more. In this environment, the race for talent is just as intense as the race for sales. But every day, people are opting in to be a part of the Target team. Because of what we have already achieved? Absolutely, but even more so because of the possibility of what we can do going forward. \n I'm just as proud of that and inspired by that as I am of any of the numbers that we've shared today. Because when I think about everything in front of us, team members like Bridget and the human touch and the guest focus that our entire team brings to their work, well, that is what it's going to ensure that our guests can always count on Target. \n Thank you so much. And now I'll hand things over to Michael. Yes. I mean specific to Food & Beverage, we have had a tremendous positive momentum over the past couple of years. We've been able to deliver double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth. We've been able to gain billions of dollars in market share over the past 2 years. And part of those benefits have come with that bigger businesses. Quite frankly, we are more credible in the grocery business. And as a more credible grocer in the grocery business, we have more opportunities to partner with our national brand partners.\n And so we are in negotiations when products are on allocation or they're limited due to supply chain constraints. Our national partners recognize that Target is a place to grow, and they're looking to us first. And I think that's a change of where we are today than where we've been in previous years.\n The other thing I would just say when it comes to things like produce, the faster we're moving, the fresher the product, the less the waste. So it helps us not only from a financial perspective, but actually from a guest experience perspective as well. Sure. To talk about food, we, as I said before, have a lot of positive momentum on what we're seeing in the food business. We continue to see opportunity to continue to grow as we think about our assortment, and I would say that the real 3 key drivers of the growth that we see in the future.\n The first is the digital business, which is our same-day services. Industry-leading in general, but particularly relative to our competitive -- our grocery competitive set. It's a real step up, not only from an experience standpoint, from a convenience and ease perspective. I think John mentioned the NPS scores. It's a differentiator relative to other particularly grocers.\n The second thing that I would say is different about our assortment, which you mentioned and the competition is our owned brands. Good & Gather, only 2 years in and is already over $2 billion in sales. Favorite Day is brand new. It developed during the pandemic and is already off to a really strong start. And then we have Market Pantry, which is a little bit lower price point, but we think will be very relevant during these inflationary times. So we think that assortment of owned brands, when we stack it up to our competitors, they're growing faster than grocery industry private-label brands. We think that's the third -- the second key driver.\n And then the third, I think, will be seasons, and we talk about that a lot. But we -- whether it's Easter or Valentine's Day, Halloween, Mother's Day or upcoming Easter, that's where we do really, really well. And Easter is coming up, and I think Target's one of the few places where you can get everything you need for the holiday. You can get the eggs for Easter. You can get the candy for Easter. You can get the basket. You can get home decor and you can get the Easter dress. And I think that's a real competitive advantage for us, particularly versus a lot of our grocery competitors."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Good morning. It's great to be back here in New York for our first live event since the start of the pandemic. I can tell you, our entire team has been looking forward to seeing you in person. It's been a long couple of years. \n But I also have to acknowledge the continued uncertainty that surrounds our world, which is only being magnified by the growing conflict between Russia and the citizens of Ukraine. It serves as another reminder of our continued need to support our teams, our guests, our communities as we all navigate these very challenging times. \n It's been 5 years since I stood in front of many of you, the head of then a $70 billion company. I was a little nervous as I laid out a bold new company strategy. Today, I stand in front of you as the head of a $106 billion growth company with a long list of proof points that our strategy is working. \n We've delivered 19 consecutive quarters of comp growth: 11 quarters of comp growth before the pandemic, 8 quarters of comp growth since the pandemic. We've grown because we've accelerated our investments in our team and in our strategy. We've accelerated our growth because our team stepped up in heroic ways, meeting the explosive demands that materialized with the pandemic. \n 5 years ago, we had 1,800 stores. I announced the plan to add stores and upgrade the stores we had. And I saw jaws drop and our stock price dive for a while. At that time, retail was about closing stores, not opening them. Many of you questioned our approach. Now 5 years later, we have almost 2,000 stores, and we're still remodeling and building new stores. \n We also know the way we run our stores is the secret to growing digital sales. Yes, the way we run our stores is the secret to why digital is now 19% of sales. So as we look at the next 5 years, we're going to continue to build on our strengths. We have a culture, we have the connections, and we care. We care about delighting our guests. We care about delivering value to our stakeholders. And as you see in our fourth quarter results, we're accelerating our investment in what's next as we continue to deliver what's now. \n For Q4, our comp sales were up nearly 9%. We achieved standout results relative to the market. We achieved growth on top of last year's all-time record growth. Our full year comp was up a remarkable 12.7%. In the last 2 years, we've grown by more than 35%. That's more than $27 billion. That figure alone would place the company in the top quarter of the Fortune 500. \n And we're seeing the benefits of stores as hubs. Growth was split nearly 50-50 between stores and digital dollars. Over this time frame, we grew 2021 traffic by more than 12% on top of nearly 4% in 2020. And we posted 2021 after-tax return on invested capital of 33%. We achieved all this growth while protecting consumers from dramatic cost of good inflation, delivering adjusted EPS that is 44% higher than last year and more than double where it was in 2019, and funding all of our ambitious strategic investments completely. \n Our Q4 results show we're taking our strategy forward to the next level with speed, with efficiency and with relevance, with care. Over the next 75 minutes, we'll show you how we're investing in opportunities for big wins. We've added Ulta Beauty to our stores. So far, our sales per square foot are strong. Guest engagement is impressive. We see the scale of opportunities as being even more impressive. We'll show you how we translated a massive influx of insights from new guests and loyal guests who are engaging even more. You'll see how we're accelerating our capabilities in personalization, creating an always-on, inspiring guest experience and driving unparalleled value to our partners with a fast-growing revenue stream for our business through Roundel. \n We'll show you how we're adding capacity, efficiency and innovation across stores and supply chain operations, driving the next phase of stores as hubs. We'll show you how we're growing by increasing our multi-category assortment. We'll show you how we're making incredible progress in a category like Food & Beverage. And above all, we'll show you how we're growing by keeping investments in our team constant. We believe our constant investment creates that critical connection between social and environmental sustainability. \n ESG is a critical part of our Target Forward strategy. So yes, we're going to keep growing in 2022. And knowing this, we've upgraded our long-term financial algorithm. Michael will lay that out later this morning. \n We are a bigger, stronger company now. We're growing on a bigger base than ever, and we recognize the power of 'and'. We have a slate of focused initiatives, and they work together in unison. We have a connection to our guests, and we have relevance to their lives. We have physical/digital experiences and the only at Target touches. We have a multi-category portfolio and a differentiated approach to curating owned and national brands. We have scale in same-day services and the pathway for more digital growth, thanks to the synchronized operation of stores, fulfillment centers, flow centers, sortation centers and Shipt. \n We have the commitment for Target forward, and we can use our size and scale to benefit people and the planet. We'll serve our guests through challenging times, and we'll find terrific opportunities for growth. We definitely have the power of 'and'. We know today's consumers are facing a series of follow hardships from the pandemic. We see higher prices across the country. We see supply chain constraints that are steadily working themselves out but will likely take more time, both of which are made more uncertain by the crisis in Ukraine. \n And we see people reevaluating how they think about work. Millions of people are searching for careers that have meaning and purpose, and they are turning to companies like Target for opportunities. As you'll hear today, we're walking our stakeholders through these challenges. We have the global scale to keep the products people want and need moving through our pipeline. We have the value levers, multi-category assortment and multichannel shopping experience. And we allow our guests to consolidate trips, get more done in one store and experience a little bit of affordable luxury for their families, especially in this inflationary economy. \n Above all, we built a culture that cares. Our teams understand the way to grow and win together is to care. They care about each other. They care about our guests. They care about our communities. They care about the millions of families we touch each and every day. As I look at the future of Target, I increasingly see care separating us from the industry. So before we dive in a corporate strategy and operational details, I want to tie some of these things together. I want to show you how our potential, our culture, our connection and caring tie into a business model that will deliver even more personalized, even more equitable, even more sustainable growth in the future. \n For a concrete example, look no further than the announcement we made yesterday to invest up to $300 million to set a new starting wage and to expand access to health care benefits to more team members and their families. 2 years ago, we raised our starting minimum wage to an industry-leading $15 per hour. Now we're setting new starting wage ranges of $15 to $24 per hour, positioning Target as a wage leader in every market where we operate. \n We'll also provide broader, faster access to health care for hourly team members, making nearly 20% of our team newly eligible for benefits and reducing the waiting period for all hourly store team members to enroll in Target medical plans. You can count on us to keep leading with investments like these. But to really appreciate where we're headed as a company, I want you to know not just what we're investing in, but whom. \n I'm thinking of Jen Mayer, Store Director of T1235 in Hudson, Wisconsin. Jen started as an intern 26 years ago. Since then, she's gone on to lead stores for Target in Iowa, Missouri, Indiana and Minnesota. In the 2 years since she moved to Hudson, store sales have increased by 30%. You'll hear about chain-wide figures like that from John, and Jen's store is a proof point to that trend. Shortly after she started in Hudson, Jen oversaw the introduction of Drive Up right at the start of the pandemic. And in 2 short years, our stores rocketed up to the top 75 for Drive Up. \n So the store performance is strong, but that's not what caught my attention. Instead, it was a speech by one of Jen's team members, a 27-year-old named Lindsay, one of the thousands of team members who joined Target in the pandemic. In front of a Black Tie Gala last fall, Lindsay related how she was devastated after losing her previous job during the COVID lockdowns of 2020. Here's what she had to say. No one who knows Jen or her team would be the least bit surprise that they hired Lindsay on the spot or that Lindsay has had a great developmental experience in the store, is doing well and appreciates her extended Target family. Jen speaks for the company when she says, it's important to give everyone opportunities. In her 20 years as a store director, she's moved hundreds of team members from part-time to full-time. She's developed and promoted dozens of team members to leadership positions. She's helped them cope with trauma, overcome disparities, build skills and save for the future. \n She speaks boldly for our culture when she says, \"I ask myself, what would I want someone to do for me? And then I tried to do that times 10.\" This is the kind of question we ask ourselves to the company all the time: what can we do with our resources, with our strategy and plans, with our team and culture to serve the world around us in a bigger or beneficial way? \n So as I hand off to our team, I'll ask you to keep that story in mind. Jen Meyer will be the first to tell you, we're just getting started, that you can't equate accelerated returns with exhausted ones. Her store with those strong results hasn't even been touched by a remodel. Starting in April, T1235 will get an Ulta Beauty and a Disney store, will significantly increase the size of her grocery footprint and add a dedicated entrance for Drive Up and Order Pick Up given the volume of same-day services. And the growth from this remodel will spur Jen's store even higher. It will combine with thousands of comparable examples countrywide to bring more joy, more equity and opportunity and even more growth in both financial and societal terms to our stakeholders here and around the world. \n Christina? We began this meeting talking about our path: 5 years, from $70 billion to $106 billion. We took you through our present, our strengths, our enablers and our culture of care. Now I'd like to talk about our future. We see a growth horizon for years to come. We will continue to invest in our strategies. We'll continue to invest in our capabilities. We'll continue to nurture a team that cares, cares about work that has purpose, cares about work that has meaning. We are growing teams that embrace our commitment to their career growth and development, our commitment to competitive pay and benefits, our commitment to being a premier American brand, our commitment to growing teams that care.\n Yes, we have the team and we have the strategy. We are 100% focused on the needs of American consumers. We have some of the most innovative and guest-centric capabilities in retail. We have a balance sheet that is the envy of the industry. And we have a record of cash generation you can count on, provide incredible value to our stakeholders.\n Yes, as we look at the growth horizon in front of us, we see many opportunities. As we move forward, we'll stay focused on helping our guests navigate through continued uncertainty with what's happening in the world around us, the pandemic and the macroeconomic environment. This includes the highest inflation in decades and the gradual loosening of supply chain bottlenecks. We'll stay focused on delivering value and affordability to our guests. We know how to deliver exceptional value and manage profitability. We can protect prices whenever possible. We can offer an unbeatable range of owned and national brands across our portfolio categories. We can bake value into our assortment, and we'll work with our vendor partners from sourcing to production to shipping. We'll ensure that those prices we offer will always be among the best in American retail.\n We have a strong record of thoughtful investment in supply chain and innovation. We provide a competitive advantage by keeping our stores stocked and our digital orders filled. We have the flexibility we need to contain with constraints so we can keep growing and thriving in any environment. And above all, we have the team.\n A few days ago, I visited several Minnesota stores. I was impressed with the Ulta Beauty displays, with our Disney shops, with our Apple stores, but what impressed me most was a team member who came up to me and said, \"Brian, I'm so proud to be working at Target. I'm proud of how you're handling the pandemic. I'm proud to be part of the Target team.\" We have a team that's committed to making Target of the future even better, the Target of the future even stronger and the Target of the future even more caring.\n For everyone who's listening today, including our teams across the globe, know we're already working to determine the best way to support humanitarian efforts for the people of Ukraine. As we have throughout the last couple of years, we'll rally our team, put our resources to work to support families through these challenging times.\n And with that, I'm going to ask all of our speakers to join me on stage, and we'll start taking your questions. All right. As we get started, I would ask you to wait for a microphone. Please introduce yourself. While you can see us, however, it's a challenging time seeing you. So I'll look for a show of hands. We've got one right up front. Michael, do you want to start? And then I'll come back and talk about our approach to share. Yes. And Chris, I'll give you a sense for how we run the business each and every day. And I can tell you, this team spends hours each week looking at share by category across our markets to make sure that we have the plans in place to constantly be taking share as we go forward. So there's lots of different metrics we look at as a team. I would tell you this team spends a tremendous amount of time looking at share, share opportunities, building plans to make sure the over $10 billion of share we've gained in the last couple of years is something that we continue to move forward as the years go by. So we are very focused on share, and our guidance will certainly be a company that continues to take share across the entire multi-category portfolio both in stores and from a digital standpoint. Great. It looks like we've got a question right over here. Christina, do you want to spend a few minutes talking about some of the consumer dynamics we're looking at right now? Yes. And Michael, I might focus on 4 areas as we sit here today. One, for those of you who have been attending these meetings over the last 3, 4 or 5 years, whether in person or from a virtual standpoint, one, I think the consistency of our strategy is critically important. And I think we've got great alignment across the organization. As Christina mentioned, from a capability standpoint, we're still in some of the early days. As much as we've been talking about remodeling stores, John Mulligan going all the way back to a meeting in 2015, we've touched about half the chain. We've got another thousand stores that we're going to touch going forward.\n We're very excited about the pipeline of new stores. And as John talked about, various size stores that allow us to maximize share opportunities in these catchments. From a same-day fulfillment standpoint, while we're very excited about the progress we made, Rick and Mark can talk about the potential upside as we think about temperature-controlled products going through Drive Up and pickup.\n So in so many areas from a own brand standpoint, from a national brand standpoint, rolling out these partnerships that we talked about a lot today, but many of them are still in limited locations. There's tremendous upside there. We think as we continue to build out our circle and our connection with our guests, there's continued upsized opportunities there. So a consistent strategy, capabilities that are still maturing, but I'll come back to the importance of our team and culture and the investments we've been making. And those are only going to strengthen our business model over time.\n The one point that perhaps we didn't call out specifically that I think is really a hallmark of Target today is we combine that focus on strategy and building capabilities and investing in our team and culture with a team that's focused on execution. And if you look at the results, how we got from $70 billion to $106 billion, yes, the strategy was critically important. And listening to the guests as we formulate that strategy was incredibly valuable. The capability certainly allowed us to accelerate during the pandemic. Those investments in team and culture, they have supported us throughout the pandemic. But this is a team that's been executing every day from a store standpoint, from a digital standpoint, category by category.\n And Michael, I think our execution will only improve in the out-years, which gives me tremendous confidence in the future growth and market share opportunities we will capture. Michael, I might ask John Mulligan to just spend a few minutes just talking about the benefits of scale. And as we've added almost $28 billion to our system, we talked about -- John talked about some of the highlights of -- our average store has added $15 million of growth. And those scale benefits and efficiency help fuel our business going forward.\n So John, you may want to highlight some of the benefits from an operational standpoint. Michael, just to build on that. I might ask Mark Schindele to start, just talk about some of the benefits that he's seeing because of that scale and the growth in store operations. And then Rick, one of the areas where I think we've seen a significant change in scale is in Food & Beverage. It's a $20 billion company now. And because of that growth rate and the change in our turns, particularly in fresh foods, there's enormous benefits that we're deriving.\n So Mark, why don't you start from a store standpoint with a few examples? And then, Rick, I think you can walk through some of the benefits we're seeing because of the increased volume we're seeing in stores, the increased turns and just the productivity we're gaining today. Let's go to another question. I think we've got one right back here. Yes. I'll take this one. We get this question all the time. And certainly, I will never say never. But for today, as we look at the opportunities that we have right here in the United States, we're going to stay very focused on the foreseeable future, executing our plans, building on our momentum and investing in the United States before we start to think about any type of future international expansion. \n All right. We got one right back here to the left. Cara, why don't I ask you to start with some highlights on Roundel. And Michael, maybe you can fill in the blanks from a financial standpoint. Let's see, right up front. Michael? Cara, you want to tackle search, most popular item? We've got a question towards the back. Rick, why don't you start from a food standpoint, and then we'll come back to some of the consumer trends we're seeing right now. And from a consumer standpoint, I'll start and I'll let Christina jump in. Let's go back to what we saw in the fourth quarter. And obviously, we saw comps up 9%, but it was driven by great traffic. And we saw a pretty balanced growth between both physical stores and digital. So we're clearly seeing a guest than a consumer who's shopping in both channels.\n As we sit here today, we're listening very closely to the consumer. And if there's anything, I think, we've learned over the last 2 years, it's just the resiliency we're seeing in the U.S. consumer environment. But specifically, we know consumers are still worried about COVID, yet they're looking for that touch of normal in their lives. And we saw that play out during the Super Bowl. Rick talked about some of the results we delivered. But that consumer and the Target guests, they wanted to be together with friends and family for the first time in a couple of years to enjoy the Super Bowl.\n We know we've got a consumer who is looking for value. But as Christina noted, they're looking for newness as well. And anything new is exciting and showing up in that basket. There's clearly inflationary concerns that are starting to pop up in the conversation. But it's still a U.S. consumer with a pretty healthy balance sheet.\n So we're going to have to watch this carefully. We know March, April are going to be important time frames as the consumer overlaps, some stimulus checks and child care. So we're taking a cautious approach to the first quarter. But we continue to see a very resilient consumer who has a solid balance sheet and is balancing that desire for value and concerns with inflation with a desire to find something new and just go back out and experience everyday life. We probably have time for 2 more questions, so let me make sure we get some new hands. Christina, I might ask you to start. And Cara, I know you've got a point of view on this topic. So I'll wrap up from here. And I want to start by thanking all of you for joining us in person. We've really been looking forward to this. It's been a long couple of years. I hope you walk away with a clear sense of our direction as a company, the strategies that will guide us going forward, the capabilities we'll continue to invest in, the important role that our team will play and the unique culture that I believe really defines and separates us from many of our peers. So I hope you leave recognizing we are committed to being a growth company, one that is a profitable growth company for years to come, great stewards of capital and will provide great returns for shareholders. But I really appreciate your time, your engagement today. And we look forward to seeing you again in person next year. So thanks for joining us. Stay well. Stay safe. We hope to see you again soon."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. At the top of the meeting, Brian shared some of the key milestones from the last 5 years. And I'd like to begin my remarks today by highlighting one more, which is the long-term financial algorithm we unveiled during that time. You'll recall that the prior algorithm anticipated low single-digit sales growth, mid-single-digit operating income growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, after tax ROIC in the mid- to high teens.\n In the 2 years leading up to the pandemic, our business was consistently generating top line performance in line with the algorithm as we saw average sales growth of 3.7% in 2018 and 2019. And on the bottom line during that period, our business grew somewhat ahead of the algorithm with average adjusted EPS growth of 16.7% over those 2 years and an average after-tax ROIC of 15.4%.\n Since the beginning of 2020, COVID has changed nearly every aspect of consumers' lives, and we've all seen its impact on the retail industry. At Target, our team and durable model navigated these changes incredibly well, advancing our business far ahead of expectations. Simply put, over the last 2 years, our financial performance blew away the prior algorithm from top to bottom. And today, we're a much larger retailer, generating industry-leading returns on capital.\n As we enter 2020, things remain far from ordinary, but a future beyond this volatile time is taking shape. And given the durable and sustainable model we've built and the ongoing investments we're making, we've updated our financial algorithm, which will define our long-term expectations beginning next year, in 2023, and beyond. This updated algorithm demonstrates our confidence in Target's ability to continue growing on top of the incredible expansion over the last couple of years.\n Specifically, over time, our updated long-term algorithm anticipates mid-single-digit annual growth in both total revenue and operating income, high single-digit annual growth in adjusted EPS, annual CapEx of $4 billion to $5 billion, after-tax ROIC in the high 20% to 30% range. Compared with our prior algorithm, this new one leans more into growth driven primarily by comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores and continued growth from other revenue sources. Our confidence in Target's ability to continue growing is based on all of the initiatives you've heard about today, which are designed to drive engagement, traffic and market share gains, including: new stores; remodels; national brand partnerships and owned brand innovations; expansion of our same-day services; growth of new and emerging revenue sources; further rollout of sortation centers; continued investments in value and affordability; leveraging guest insights to enhance our assortment and promotions while personalizing the guest experience; elevating guest service through investments in the team, training and technology, all while investing in Target Forward, to enhance the long-term sustainability of the business and the planet.\n Since today is the first time we've included other revenue in our top line guidance, I want to pause and cover some of what's reflected in that line of the P&L and what's been driving its growth. And while there are many smaller items represented on this slide, profit sharing income on our credit card portfolio has historically accounted for more than half of it. But in recent years, Roundel has been the primary growth driver of this line, causing it to become its second largest component. I want to emphasize, however, that Roundel's impact extends well beyond the amount reflected on this line alone as a meaningful portion of Roundel's income reduces our cost of sales, benefiting our gross margin. Among other notable drivers, Shipt membership fees are included on this line, along with the fees we received from third-party vendors on Target Plus, which are expected to grow over time.\n Moving to the operating income line. You'll note that our long-term growth expectations are consistent with the prior algorithm, but we don't rely on rate expansion to get there. Now I should quickly point out, we'll happily welcome rate expansion when it happens for the right reasons, including the massive scale benefits we've realized over the last 2 years. But as I've said many times, given that we're focused on maximizing profit dollar growth, our plans account for the inherent trade-off between profit rates and top line growth. Put another way, a durable business model anticipates the need for continual investments to deliver sustainable growth. As such, we've built an algorithm based on driving and harvesting continued efficiencies in our business and continually reinvesting those savings in growth that further differentiates Target through our team, our stores and the entire guest experience.\n Among the factors that will drive our operating margin rate over time, we expect the headwinds and tailwinds will generally balance each other out. On the gross margin line, those factors include merchandise mix, channel mix and merchandising strategies. On the SG&A line, cost leverage, efficiency gains and team investments are most notable. On the D&A line, leverage and accelerated depreciation are the primary drivers. Also consistent with the prior algorithm, this updated one anticipates high single-digit growth in adjusted EPS driven by mid-single-digit growth in operating income combined with the benefit of continued share repurchases.\n Moving on to capital deployment. I want to first reiterate our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. Our top priority is to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. We then look to support the dividend and build on our 50-year record of consecutive annual dividend increases. And finally, when we have capacity beyond those first 2 uses, we repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\n Beginning with investments in our business. We expect ongoing CapEx will be in the $4 billion to $5 billion range annually, and we'll be focused first on our continued investments in our stores-as-hubs model, including new locations, full store remodels, fulfillment retrofits and projects to support key national brand partnerships. In addition, as John outlined, we'll continue to invest in our upstream supply chain, sortation centers and DC automation to further reduce store workload.\n Even after these sizable CapEx investments, we expect to have ample capacity for shareholder returns as well given the robust operating cash flow our business continues to generate, amounting to more than $8.5 billion in 2021. We'll maintain our focus on growing the annual dividend, something we've accomplished for 50 consecutive years and look to maintain a 40% payout ratio over time. In addition, given our expectation for continued strong cash generation by our business, we'll have the capacity to return capital through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A credit ratings.\n Finally, the most dramatic change from our prior algorithm pertains to our after-tax ROIC, where our updated range of expectations is 10-plus percentage points higher than before. This change highlights the asset efficiency of our stores-as-hubs model, which has unlocked the full potential of our store locations to flexibly serve our guests. With this model, our business has generated revenue growth of more than 35% or nearly $28 billion over the last 2 years, largely on the existing asset base.\n Now I want to move on to expectations for this year. As I step back and think about where we are and where we've been, it's clear we're still in the midst of the pandemic, but we've entered a new phase. In this phase, we're still facing multiple challenges and uncertainties, including a tight labor market and persistent supply chain bottlenecks, which are contributing to higher inflation rates than we've seen in decades. And beyond those ongoing challenges, we'll soon get to see how the consumer and economy move beyond government stimulus as we compare over the large first quarter packages that benefited consumers both in 2020 and again, last year.\n However, the last couple of years have also proven the durability and flexibility of our business and financial model. Specifically, relying on stores as fulfillment hubs allows our team to conveniently and efficiently serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. This includes our suite of same-day services, which differentiate Target and provide a reliable, fast and easy shopping experience. Our model features a unique brand and balanced merchandise -- broad and balanced merchandise assortment, allowing us to serve guests and drive trips to serve a wide variety of wants and needs. And our long history of investing in value and affordability, which has long been a key differentiator, becomes even more important in an inflationary environment.\n As a result, with a proven model and the multiple growth investments we've highlighted today, we expect to continue growing the top line in 2022, generating a low to mid-single-digit increase in revenue, on top of historically strong growth over the last 2 years. On the operating margin line this year, we're planning to deliver a rate of 8% or higher, reflecting several deliberate rate investments to position our business for long-term profitable growth.\n First on that list are continued investments in pay and benefits to support our team as we build on the enormous progress we've made over the past few years. Beyond the team, this year's investments in growth capacity will drive some rate pressure. And we're planning for a small increase in markdown rates in 2022 as we move past the dramatically low rates we've seen over the last couple of years. Finally, and importantly, we'll continue to focus on value and affordability in this inflationary environment. That means taking a thoughtful long-term approach to pricing decisions, ensuring that we deliver unbeatable value for our guests.\n We have many levers to combat costs, and price is the one we pull last, not first. As a result, product costs within our assortment have risen faster than retail in recent quarters, reflecting this intentional approach in deliberate pacing. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the first half of this year as we maintain our focus on affordability for our guests. Altogether, given our expectations for revenue growth and purposeful operating margin rate investments, we're positioned to deliver low single-digit growth in operating income dollars this year.\n Consistent with the longer term, we expect CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range this year. This range is wider than we typically see at this point of the year given continued delays in receiving fixtures and equipment, along with permitting and inspection delays in local communities. Put another way, our hope is to be at the top end of this range in 2022, but it's possible that external factors will continue to affect certain projects.\n Regarding the dividend, later this year, we plan to recommend that our Board approve a per share dividend increase in the 20% to 30% range as we continue to move toward a 40% payout ratio over time. In addition, given our current cash position and expectations for strong cash flow, we believe our 2022 share repurchases will be at or above the $7 billion we accomplished in 2021.\n Putting all of our expectations together, a low to mid-single-digit revenue increase, an operating margin rate of 8% or higher and continued robust share repurchase activity, we're positioned to generate high single-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this year, on top of a 112% increase over the last 2 years.\n While I'm not going to provide detailed quarterly guidance today, I want to pause and talk about how our 2022 profit performance is expected to play out within the year given some of the unique factors involved. Specifically, in the front half of this year, we'll be annualizing last year's government stimulus while facing ongoing supply chain pressures and other cost increases. In contrast, as the year progresses, we'll begin comping over the period of higher costs that emerged in the back half of last year, while our supply chain and merchandising strategies have more time to adjust. As such, we expect our quarterly profit performance will be choppy during the year and generally improve as the year progresses.\n Q1 provides a timely example. This chart shows the variability of our Q1 profit rate over the last 3 years. Looking ahead, we expect our first quarter 2022 rate will move to something that's relatively high to our history but well below last year's 9.8% rate, which was unusually high due to some unique factors.\n As I get ready to close my remarks, I want to pause and spend a minute talking about the key role that efficiency and disciplined expense management have played in our recent success and how we're committed to maintaining that discipline going forward. And while I can provide many examples of our team's cost discipline, I want to focus on a couple of notable ones.\n First on that list are meaningful efficiency gains we've realized in digital fulfillment. Across each of our digital fulfillment nodes, from package delivery to in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, we've implemented multiple processes and process improvements and rolled out new technology to remove costs and increase speed to our guests. As a result, over the last 3 years, our average per unit digital fulfillment costs have declined by more than 50%, reflecting both efficiency gains and the benefit of mix as our most efficient same-day services have become a bigger and bigger portion of our digital sales.\n Looking ahead, the rollout of sortation centers presents a compelling opportunity to further reduce the unit cost of last-mile delivery. As John mentioned, in the Twin Cities market, where we've been piloting our first sortation center, we've seen our average per unit last-mile fulfillment costs go down by nearly 1/3.\n The second example I want to highlight is the enormous benefit we've realized from the investments we've been making in our team. These investments have driven positive change to the lives of hundreds of thousands of team members, offering more steady income, pathways to career growth and education and access to benefits that meet their evolving needs. But these investments are delivering efficiency and growth in our business as well. A portion of these gains come directly from the fact that with high retention rates and improved training, our team can accomplish tasks more efficiently than in the past.\n But that's just the beginning. Because of our investments in the team, they're continually delivering higher levels of service, building on the trust we've established with our guests. This results in higher satisfaction scores, higher engagements and more return visits. And with higher service levels, Target becomes a more attractive partner for leading national brands, enabling partnerships like Ulta Beauty, Apple, Disney and Levi's.\n Once you've accounted for all of the efficiency and top line benefits that have come from our team investments, you can see why I reiterate time and time again that caring for and investing in our team is the best long-term investment we can make in our business. In fact, whether I'm looking at these investments as the CFO or through the lens of my earlier role supporting stores or leading pay and benefits for our HR team, the lessons are consistent. Whether you're talking about physical capital or human capital, underinvesting might lead to great-looking results over a very short period, but they're not sustainable over time.\n So before I close, I want to pause and express my gratitude to our team, many of whom are listening into this meeting today. You have delivered industry-leading results over the last couple of years while taking care of our guests and each other. And importantly, during that time, you've made Target a much stronger company, positioning us to deliver sustainable, profitable growth from a significantly larger retail platform.\n I want to thank you all on behalf of all of our stakeholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Yes. As we think about the long-term algorithm, comp growth will certainly be the biggest driver there. Where that lands in a given year, might be up or down. But I'll tell you, we expect to be a business that continues to grow and gain share year-over-year. The investments we're making are to drive outsized growth, and that should come with share gains. I think your question grabbed about all the different variables there, Chris. So I'll do my best to summarize. The shape of profit for the year will be like we described, where you could expect it to build over the course of the year. When it comes to markdowns specifically, there's some markdowns that we've been rooting for returning. To be better in stock with stronger inventory levels means a few more clearance markdowns, and we're planning for that outcome in the upcoming year.\n When it comes to promotional markdowns, we should realize some sustained benefits in markdown efficiency as we've gotten bigger, and we'll stay close to the competitive environment to make sure that we're priced right every day and that we're competitive on promotion as well. Yes. The only thing I might tack on to that is the algorithm contemplates those investments. The CapEx we're putting to work, the way we've described operating margin and the fuel we can create to reinvest in the business. Growth doesn't just happen, you have to invest in it. The algorithm contemplates that. Yes. I touched on this a little bit in my remarks. You can think about $1 billion as kind of the size of the total Roundel business. And there's a piece of that, that shows up in other revenue and there's a piece of that, that helps us out on the gross margin line, too.\n But you'll notice, we don't describe it as some separate other business. Cara's point on it starts first with our guests. When we can solve for a guest problem arm in arm with a business partner, that creates value in total. And part of that is captured in that $1 billion, part of that is captured in a better guest experience overall. Yes. So John has talked in the past about the capacity we have to continue growing in stores. And the thing I'd come back to there is we've seen over the last couple of years how well stores and stores as hubs scale. I mean we've got productivity gains and productivity per foot gains across the chain. It's actually true that the biggest stores generated the biggest productivity gains over the last few years. And so that speaks to the headroom we're creating.\n We know the throughput we can get in stores. And if you kind of go through quartile by quartile in our stores, that implies we've got a lot of stores that could get a lot bigger before they tap out. And so we feel really good about the opportunity to keep growing the business. But stores as hubs is the thing that enables so much of that capacity. Yes. I think the last 2 years are pretty instructive. The rate growth we saw over the last 2 years came from scale benefits. That's a more sustainable version of rate growth. But to be clear, that's not the number in the P&L we're optimizing for. It's profit dollar growth over time. We'd expect to find the fuel to fund the investments to power the top line, and that's kind of the thing that's at the heart of the algorithm. But when we see sustainable rate growth, we'll welcome it just like you saw over the last couple of years. Yes. I don't know if my crystal ball is that clear, Greg. But the story that we've really seen most recent quarter to start with is the incredible growth in traffic. There's some puts and takes in basket, but virtually all of our growth in Q4 came from traffic. So we'll -- as you heard today, we'll continue to be focused on protecting value and making sure that our price position is strong, and that's working. It's leading to deepening engagements, it's leading to more trips to Target.\n And so where exactly AUR lands over the course of the year, I think, is going to be a journey we'll all take together, and we'll see. But traffic has been the story for us."

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Well, good morning, everybody. So I'm often asked how Target continues to operate within a challenging and volatile environment, putting growth on top of growth and building trust with our guests quarter after quarter. I could point to our agile supply chain, our hundreds of omnichannel stores, our industry-leading fulfillment capabilities and the operational algorithms that make it all work. But the real key to our continued growth is our global team and all the ways they're using our resources and operations to take care of our guests. \n In just the last 2 years, they've picked and packed 4x more items for same-day fulfillment, supported double-digit store traffic gains with a safe inspiring environment, opened over 60 new stores, remodeled hundreds more, and moved record levels of inventory to support our growing needs of our guests. Brian touched on how our Target team is showing up for each other and how that spirit of care starts here with our team and then extends to our guests and our communities. \n Our team is the connection across our business and the pulse of our operation, and I want to acknowledge their impact on how target shows up today and how we'll continue to deliver in the future. \n The power of our team is always visible in our stores, nearly 2,000 of them in neighborhoods across the country, serving as inspiring shopping destinations and local fulfillment hubs. Although the idea of leveraging stores to fulfill online orders is widely embraced across retail today, we are on our own when we introduced the concept 5 years ago. As a result, we're years ahead of others who just started using physical stores to meet digital demand. We know using stores as hubs would give guests more choice and convenience while giving our operation more flexibility and capacity for future growth. That was true prior to 2020 and could have not have been more essential since that time. \n Today, when our guests turn to Target, no matter how they choose to stop, those stores answer the call. Located just miles from most American homes, our stores handled more than 95% of the $100 billion plus in sales we did in 2021, including 12% more in-store traffic and most of our digital demand. Notably, more than half of those online sales were filled through our same-day services: Drive Up; Order Pick Up; and same-day delivery with Shipt. \n Our Chief Stores Officer, Mark Schindele, will share more shortly about how we'll keep investing in those services. They not only offer the quickest fulfillment at the lowest cost, their trip drivers that actually deepen guest engagement with Target. And on top of it all, they are the fastest-growing part of our business. This past year, they grew 45%, building on 235% growth in 2020, showing the continued guest appetite for fast and easy shopping. \n With digital fulfillment growing exponentially and in-store traffic continuing to rise, our stores are supporting more and more volume. In the last 5 years, the average store has added $15 million in sales, which means $40 million stores have become $55 million to $60 million stores and growing. And as our stores become more productive, they naturally gain efficiencies, including significant cost leverage and lower clearance markdown rates. So as they contribute more to our top line, they further protect the bottom line. \n We've said from the beginning that our stores have the capacity to support higher growth. That remains true today, even as average sales per store have risen 30% in just the last 2 years. But that enormous growth also means our operation is years ahead of where we had planned. So we're continuing to build upstream capacity we'll need over time. As we do, we're investing in ways that enable growth and move us toward our Target Forward sustainability commitments, from how we build and run our stores to the standards we hold for our vendor partners as well as how we will keep taking care of our team. We're continually strengthening an operation that supports a long future for Target and the world around us. \n Our investments in capacity start upstream and how we innovate within our supply chain to deliver on the growing need for inventory in our stores. Before last year, we hadn't added a new regional distribution center in over a decade, even as our total sales grew 40% over that same time period. Rather than add buildings, we grew by investing in automation, robotics and process design to improve the efficiency of our existing sites. Of course, we'll always keep investing to make our buildings more efficient. But with an additional $27 billion in sales over the last 2 years, we can't rely on that alone. It's time to expand our network. \n Last summer, we opened 2 new distribution facilities: 1 in New Jersey and 1 in Chicago. Today, we have 4 more currently in development that will open over the next few years with plans for several more to follow. Lighting up new buildings adds tremendous capacity to our supply chain network in support of our stores and will position Target to handle many more years of growth. \n As we continue investing upstream from our stores, we're also innovating downstream with sortation centers to accelerate our last-mile capabilities. These centers help us further scale our stores as hub strategy and create room for future growth. The first of these facilities, located not far from our headquarters in Minneapolis, has been up and running for just over a year. Before it opened, our store teams would fulfill online orders and palletize the packages in the backroom, waiting for 1  daily pickup from our carrier partners. Now Target trucks collect those packages at our 40-plus Twin City stores throughout the day, keeping orders moving, while giving stores more room to fill even more. \n The packages arrive at the sortation center, where they're organized by ZIP Code, and allocated to partners for direct delivery. Last spring, we integrated Shipt's last-mile delivery capabilities into the operation. Shipt drivers pick up a batch of orders sorted by neighborhood to make fast and efficient deliveries to our guests. Even during peak season, when most orders had a standard 2-day promise, these packages were delivered in just over a day on average. At the same time, the average unit fulfillment cost dropped by nearly 1/3, and that's before we've added automation that will make these buildings more productive in the future. \n Our Minneapolis pilot shows how sortation centers will make stores even more efficient as fulfillment hubs and allow us to roll out a next-day delivery capability at scale. We started to expand this concept into other densely populated markets. By the end of next month, we'll have 5 more centers up and running from Dallas to Philadelphia with another 5 planned in additional metro areas later this year. \n This capability isn't something we built overnight. It's the result of many strategic decisions we've made over time, working together in a model that's unique to Target. It works hand in glove with our stores-as-hub strategy. It leans on technology we acquired and further developed through Grand Junction and Deliv to optimize the most efficient route for every package. And it's unlocked by integrating Shipt's delivery capability into our last-mile operation. \n Our sortation center expansion will add meaningful speed and efficiency to our fulfillment capabilities so we can field continued growth for the long term. \n [Presentation] The ongoing investments in our supply chain are designed to keep our stores at the center of how we serve our guests. Just as important are the continued investments we make in the physical stores themselves. Since 2017, we've completed top-to-bottom remodels across nearly half our chain, bringing even more inspiration to the store environment while helping our team more effectively support online fulfillment. \n This year, we'll remodel around 200 stores and keep that pace in the years that follow. And these aren't the same remodels we are rolling out when we started. Each year, our architects and construction crews update our plans to keep raising the bar on retail design. And our guests continue to tell us they like what they see. Following a remodel, traffic gains across the store helped drive an average 2% to 4% sales lift in year 1 and another 1% to 2% lift in year 2. \n As our full store program continues, we'll also invest in hundreds of smaller projects to support growing in-store partnerships, including Ulta Beauty, Disney and Starbucks, and they make store fulfillment even easier for our team. As we invest in existing -- in our existing store portfolio, we'll continue to open around 30 new stores a year. For the better part of the last decade, our store growth has been driven by small formats. With a more flexible footprint, these stores have enabled us to enter new markets and reach more guests. \n This year, we'll keep going, opening doors in iconic sites, from the historic streets of Charleston, South Carolina to the buzzing energy of Times Square. At the same time, small isn't always got planned. But our store is now more productive than ever. There are benefits to a bigger box. And given the favorable real estate market, these sites are available at attractive deals. I'm not talking about our largest store formats, though they continue to do extremely well for us. I'm talking about midsized stores, 2 to 3x bigger than our small formats. These sites are built in dense neighborhoods with enough room for a traditional store experience and digital fulfillment, helping us bring Target closer to even more guests. \n This versatility is another example of how we built a flexible operation to support our growth. Ten years ago, we designed and built 2 store formats: large and larger. Today, we have the opportunity to open and operate stores in spaces of any size so we can meet our guests wherever they are. This year, we'll open stores ranging from 14,000 square feet to 10x that size, using that flexibility to design shopping experiences that best meet the needs of each local community. \n And before I hand it over to Mark, I'll close with how I started with our team. You heard it from Brian and Jen, our store director in Wisconsin, \"We're still in the early days of our growth strategy.\" And it's our team, continuing to accelerate capabilities and build trust with our guests that will keep Target growing well into the future. As we've invested in their growth, from wages and benefits that you heard about today, to education, skill training and career progression, internal surveys show our team's engagement, morale and confidence in Target's future remain strong. That stability has led to better guest service, more collaboration, and as Brian said, a finer ability to flex, adapt and navigate the new challenges of being a bigger, stronger Target. \n When we take care of our team, they take care of our guests, proof that Target's culture will power our strategy to deliver ease, inspiration and joy for our guests for years to come. Take a look. \n [Presentation] Yes, I think that's right there. I mean you hit on what the 2 big drivers are. One is scale. And as we get bigger, there's benefits that flow through the individual store P&L. First of all, they're leveraging all the fixed stuff. That's the easy-peasy part, but everything becomes more efficient. When we go from $40 million to $55 million, we may only add one truck a week to that store or 2 trucks a week. We don't double the number of trucks that a store has to work. So you gain efficiency there in the backroom as you're moving inventory to the front of the store. Things like that just create efficiency.\n Again, once you're out on the floor and stocking goods, if you're a $40 million or $55 million store, that doesn't change. You're out on the floor. If I put 2 on the shelf or 3 on the shelf, nothing really changes there. There's a marginal amount of incremental work, right? So those are the little things that create additional scale in our hourly payroll, which, of course, is the biggest expense we have. That flows down through the entire P&L.\n And then, of course, Michael talked about our same-day fulfillment and our ship-to-home fulfillment. We have improved individually each of those paths to the guests. Each one of those services, the cost structure and the mix helps us because the most -- the best NPS scores, the ones our guests like the best are same-day services, which are the most efficient as we've been talking about for a long time. And then you layer on sort centers where we said -- and look, we've had this open for 14 months, just 14 months, and we already said it's way cheaper than what we were already doing. So there's some -- I mean you've seen us do it over the last 5 years, continue to hone processes and improve them, Mark and his team, improving the pathing, improving the pick, improving the prep, improving the pack. That's a lot to say, improving all 3 of those. And we'll do that all over again with sort centers.\n So so much runway for us to continue to drive efficiency and bring expense out and continue to invest in service on the floor at the store, just a huge opportunity for us. Yes. Well, first, let me be clear. We will open up big stores if we find opportunities to open up big stores. No question. We're going to open a 144,000-square-foot store this year. We're excited about that. So we'll keep doing that.\n We went from big to small, almost exclusively small, 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, maybe 30,000. Those are great sites. We'll continue to do that. We love those, one just a few blocks from here soon.\n What we're saying there's this middle ground that we haven't really built in the past. And Brian and I have walked in those. We built some 60,000, 70,000, 80,000, even 90,000-square-foot stores, a lot of old Kmarts. Love them. They're big enough that you get the entire Target experience, but the backroom is big enough so that we can do all of our digital fulfillment as well. So we get this great middle ground between the 2. And I think our message today is we can do all of that.\n Over the past few years, between our properties team, store design, construction, Christina's merchant team because assorting these stores is critical, getting the right assortment for the neighborhood to serve that community is incredibly important. We can do all of that. And so there are these opportunities now out there where you can get into a dense urban neighborhood, a dense suburban neighborhood with a 90,000-square-foot store, great. We'll do that all day long.\n I think the sort center, the great thing about that is it gets stuff out of the backroom faster. Much like we want to get the inventory on to the front of the store, which Mark's team has done an outstanding job over the last 2 years, we want the boxes out of the backroom. All of that creates capacity in the backroom, more pack stations, more volume, keep it moving, just keep things moving. And that's why the sort centers are so important to that strategy. But we'll do whatever from an opening perspective. I think the other thing I'd add on is as inventory turns increase with scale, you just push things through faster. Speed and flow of inventory is the key to the whole game, like we were just talking about with Robby. And as that happens, we see it in our largest stores, they just move inventory. It's constantly moving through. It shows up at night. It's out the store the next day. That's capacity. You're just moving inventory. So a lot of headroom for growth from that perspective. Joe, you know us better than that. We will -- by the end of next week or next month, we will have 6 of them open. We're thinking probably 5 more later this year. And of course, part of this little unknown, same supply chain problems that have impacted our ability to remodel and open new stores, things are slower, permits are slower, everything slower. We'll see. But that's where we're headed. And we think there's an opportunity over the next 4 or 5 years to continue to build at least that pace, perhaps a little bit faster. But when you look at the major or urban areas across the country, lots of opportunity.\n And I wouldn't say, in the case of many cities, it will not be just one per city. Just the way you navigate some cities and the way they're carved up makes that harder to do. And so the opportunity for us to do several in the city is there for us. But that's all down the road. So you'll see us continue to build into it."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 17, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relation. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. \n On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. \n In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his perspective on our outlook. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are consistent with what our team has been delivering quarter after quarter for years now. And they continue to demonstrate the extraordinary level of engagement we're seeing from our guests, both with our brand and with our team. \n In the third quarter, comparable sales expanded 12.7%, on top of a nearly 21% increase one year ago. Consistent with recent quarters, traffic was the primary driver of this year's growth as our guests increasingly turned to Target to serve their wants and needs. Across our sales channels, store sales were the primary growth driver this quarter, while same-day services propelled our digital growth. \n Since the third quarter of 2019, prior to the pandemic, Q3 store sales have expanded by $3.8 billion, while digital sales have increased another $3.1 billion. This provides a vivid demonstration of the flexibility of our operating model to serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. All of these results reflect the level of guest engagement far beyond what many would have imagined a few years ago, when we started making huge investments throughout our business, in our stores, new brands, same-day services, supply chain, and importantly, our team. \n Back then, Target was already known for our world-class team, a differentiated shopping experience, unique assortment and an iconic brand. But we knew there was much more to do. We saw a clear opportunity to build on that solid foundation, finding new ways to enhance our capabilities, while strengthening the bond with both our team and our guests. And today, those bonds have never been stronger. As I mentioned, within our digital capabilities, more and more of our guests are trying and embracing our industry-leading same-day services. Third quarter sales through these services have expanded by nearly 400% or $2 billion over the last 2 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, sales through these services have grown by more than $6 billion since 2019, a number larger than the total sales of many prominent retailers. \n Beyond fulfillment capabilities, our balanced multi-category assortment is another key driver of flexibility and resiliency within our business model. The breadth of our assortment, both within and across our core categories, allows our team to quickly and seamlessly serve our guests, even when their wants and needs are changing rapidly. \n In the third quarter, we saw consistent strong growth across our entire merchandising portfolio. More specifically, all 5 of our core merchandise categories saw a double-digit growth in the quarter, ranging from the low double-digits to the mid-teens, resulting in strong market share gains on top of unprecedented share growth in 2020. \n And we're not slowing down in our efforts to serve our guests. We continue to invest in key partnerships that enhance our assortment and experience, including the opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops and our recent announcement that we're doubling the number of enhanced Apple experiences in electronics. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. \n In our conference call 3 months ago, we outlined multiple actions we're taking to support our inventory and in-stocks, given the supply chain challenges that have emerged throughout the pandemic. As you know, those pressures only intensified in the third quarter. And our team has done an outstanding job in the face of these challenges, identifying bottlenecks and finding solutions to keep inventory flowing throughout our network. \n Although efforts drove some incremental costs in the quarter, we view them as a continuation of the many productive long-term investments we're making in our business in support of the trust we have built with our guests. And obviously, our guests responded to these efforts with strong third quarter traffic, which we expect will continue in Q4 and beyond. \n Beyond our supply chain, the team has done a great job navigating through broader cost pressures as many vendors have raised wholesale prices to accommodate higher costs within their businesses. As our team faced these cost increases, they maintained a guest-first approach and a focus on value while managing overall profitability as well. As a result, our business delivered strong third quarter financial results, from the top to the bottom of the P&L, while building on the trust we've established with our guests. \n So I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of our teams across the company, from headquarters to stores, from our merchandising, distribution and transportation teams to our sourcing offices around the world. Because of your agility, energy and selfless collaboration, Target delivered for our guests and our shareholders in the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter and ramp up for the peak holiday season, we're really well positioned to continue delivering for all of our stakeholders and close out an already amazing year. I want to thank you for everything you do. \n So the theme you'll hear in today's call is that we're excited and ready for the holiday season. We know our guests are excited to celebrate, following a year in 2020 when many families stayed apart due to safety concerns. This year, our guests have eagerly started their holiday shopping, as they respond to our holiday promotions, low price guarantees and our ongoing efforts to provide ease, reliability, safety and value across every shopping experience. \n And importantly, we have taken multiple actions to support our guests during the holiday season and beyond. On top of the investments in inventory, in-stocks and value I outlined earlier, we've announced that we're hiring 30,000 new year-round supply chain team members to support our current and expected growth. \n In our stores, we're providing our team members with more pay, flexibility and reliable hours this holiday season, offering more than 5 million additional hours to our existing team, and investment of more than $75 million over the holiday season. To supplement the additional hours from our existing team, we're hiring another 100,000 seasonal team members throughout the country, many of whom will have an opportunity to stay on with Target after the holidays. \n And importantly, during a season in which our guests are busier than any other time of the year, our merchandising and marketing teams are focused on cutting through the clutter. That means we're keeping our marketing messages and promotions simple and our operations flexible to offer an easy and reliable experience for our guests no matter how they choose to shop. \n And finally, while Target has already had an outstanding year, our team is looking ahead and not slowing down. We're continuing to invest in our future, in our new stores and existing stores, our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, in our owned and national brands, and the safety and well-being of our team. \n We're investing in Target Forward, an ambitious commitment to co-create an equitable and regenerative future. Together with our guests, partners and communities. All of these efforts are focused on advancing Target's leadership position within retail, taking a guest-led approach to everything we do and supporting our company values to care, grow and win together. \n I had the privilege of working alongside this great team as they bring our values to life every day across every part of the company. I'm endlessly grateful for their passion and support of our guests of our brand and for each other. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate what happens when our team lives out our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. When we lead with our guests first, we continue to build upon the trust that we have carefully earned with them over time. And when our strategies are guest-led, we grow our business, which supports our team, our financial performance and our ability to give back to our communities and the planet. \n As you heard from Brian, third quarter comparable sales grew 12.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in every one of our core merchandising categories. Even within those core categories, sales strength was broad-based, and virtually every area of the business grew over last year. This shows the power of our multi-category assortment in driving guest relevance and affinity for Target. \n While growth came from all categories, third quarter performance was led by our Essentials, Beauty and Food & Beverage categories, all of which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens. These businesses continue to deliver substantial share gains on top of last year's gains through both trip frequency and basket growth. \n In Essentials, growth was led by baby care, pets and over-the-counter health care categories. Strength in Food & Beverage was most notable in our fresh and frozen categories as well as in snacks and candy. Hardlines, which comped in the mid-teens on top of mid-30% comps last year, was fueled by incredible momentum in our toys and sporting goods businesses, which both saw comp growth north of 20%. Electronics delivered low single-digit comp growth on top of last year's comp of nearly 60%. \n In our Apparel business, comp sales grew in the low double-digits despite unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. Performance was strongest in swim, young contemporary, intimates and hosiery. In Home, low double-digit comp growth was led by seasonal and stationary categories, and reflected record-setting performance in the back-to-school, back-to-college and Halloween seasons. \n We have seen consistently strong results across seasonal categories, results that clearly signal that our guests are excited to celebrate the holidays with loved ones in new, old and reimagined ways. However they celebrate, our guests remain focused on meeting their wants and needs with ease, convenience and value. And as the holidays approach, they are turning to Target for these solutions. This is about more than just checking items off the list. Beyond working through the logistics of the holiday, our guests are looking to us to provide joy, and a joyous holiday is exactly what we plan to deliver. \n We continuously evaluate our guests' mindset, which serves as a North Star for all our strategies and decisions. We remain laser-focused on their experiences with us and expectations of us. And we strive to build flexibility and agility into our plans to ensure we show up at our best for them during the holidays and all year round. \n We are confident in our ability to navigate the broader retail landscape. And we're eager to share all that we've planned for the upcoming holidays. Whether our guests are rekindling old holiday traditions or finding new ways to celebrate the season, we're focused on making Target the destination that makes it easy, safe, inspiring and affordable to celebrate what matters most, the magic of spending time with those we love. \n As John will outline in more detail, our teams are working diligently to get the right inventory to the right place at the right time. Doing so has driven some near-term gross margin pressure, appropriate long-term investment in the relationship with our guests. Bottom line, based on the incredible efforts of our team, we feel good about our inventory levels heading into the holiday season. \n In addition to the investments in our inventory position, we remain committed to providing great value with every trip to Target. And that value goes far beyond delivering exceptional everyday pricing. It includes offering compelling holiday deals, great quality products and an array of options to support all budgets, including accessible payment options. \n Last year, we spread our promotions throughout the months of November and December to avoid crowding in stores, and we heard from our guests that they loved it. As a result, we're spreading savings throughout the season again this year to give guests flexibility to get the best deals on their terms whenever and however they choose to shop. We'll feature compelling offers throughout the season on top items, great weekly deals and surprise deals of the day, both in-store and online, as well as additional deals for Target Circle members. \n And to reinforce value throughout the season, we recently announced the launch of our Holiday Price Match Guarantee, our most robust price match ever. When guests see Holiday Best deals at Target, they can shop confidently, knowing they are getting Black Friday sized savings with our best planned price of the season. In essence, any time they see a deal at Target, our guests can be confident it's the right time to buy. \n We also know that our guests want flexibility, not just in what they want to buy and how they want to shop, but how to manage their budget as well. That's why with the help of 2 new partners, Sezzle and Affirm, we've added new payment solutions that allow our guests to buy what they need now, take advantage of our best deals and pay at a pace that works best for them.\n With a strong inventory position and a great value proposition, we're able to lean into our uniquely Target assortment to build upon our traditional offering great gifting ideas and easy gathering solutions, like even more creative Gingerbread House making kits, Bullseye's top toys and gift sets for any budget. Spanning beauty, apparel, food and beverage and more, these gifting options will bring together the best of only our Target-owned brands with curated national brands. And for those seeking extra inspiration, our thoughtfully curated digital shopping lists will bring the joyful discovery our guests love, helping them find the perfect gifts for anyone on their list, whether they are shopping our stores or on our site. \n In addition to gifting, guests are focused on gathering with friends and family. And we have everything they need to create memorable moments, whether it's preparing a delicious meal, throwing a festive family party or hosting a game night with friends. From Good & Gather cheeseboard starter kits and Favorite Day baked-goods, to Threshold fall collections, including festive baking dishes, serving platters in the color of the season, and an array of plates, linens and other table toppers, all $15 and under. We want to create joy for all of our guests this holiday season, and we are excited to do so with our most inclusive assortment to date. \n Throughout our digital and in-store shopping experience, our guests are sure to see themselves reflected in our culturally relevant gifting and gathering solutions. We'll highlight Black-owned businesses in Beauty, Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Home, including McBride Sisters wine pairings, Bipoc Author in our $10 book assortment and a limited time Black artist partnership in wrapping paper. And our guests will see themselves represented in inclusive gift card messaging and imagery, providing options that celebrate the many meaningful holidays of the season, including Kwanzaa and Hanukkah. \n We're also delivering joy beyond our holiday assortment by building on our incredible legacy of creating differentiated shop-in-shop experiences that drive traffic and inspire our guests. They continue to tell us how much they love our exciting and expanding partnerships, with brands like Disney, Ulta Beauty and Apple. \n With each partnership, we're adding excitement, convenience and newness for our guests, while unlocking incremental growth for each of the partners. So it's no surprise we're building on this momentum in time for the holiday season. We are tripling the number of Disney stores at Target locations and doubling our Apple shop-in-shop experiences. \n On top of that, of course, this will be our debut holiday season featuring Ulta Beauty at Target. And on the subject of Ulta Beauty at Target, our guests are telling us it's clearly hitting the bull's-eye, with makeup, skincare, bath and body, hair care and fragrance from more than 50 top brands now available at Ulta Beauty at Target. Both in stores and online, there's plenty to love about this new partnership, and we are so excited for all that is yet to come. \n And we'll build on our tradition of joy making partnerships this December when we will launch an exclusive lifestyle collection of products with one of the most beloved toy brands ever, Lego. Think brick-inspired hooded sweatshirts, colorful Lego-shaped tumblers and of course, iconic Lego brick and mini figure sets. This collection builds on our long-standing partnership with the Lego Group and reflects our shared values of inclusivity, optimism and joy. With nearly 300 must-haves for the family, pets and home, and most of the colorful brick inspired items under $30, our guests are sure to find something everyone will love on any budget. \n Joy, ease, value, inclusivity, the ingredients helping to deliver on our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life, a recipe that we refine quarter after quarter by listening to our guests, learning from their choices and working across our talented team. And these plans wouldn't come to life without the many talents and contributions of our dedicated team. \n So with deep gratitude and humility, I want to thank our team for serving the communities, for showing up every day for our guests and each other, and for bringing Target's values to life. You inspire me with all that you do. And because of you, I know we will win this holiday season. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. Every day, across the operations team, we focus on execution. On our supply chain team, the focus is on moving the right amount of inventory to the right place at the right time. In our stores, which fulfill more than 95% of our total sales, the team focuses on delivering a great guest experience across hundreds of millions of guest transactions every quarter. And on our properties team, the team focuses on optimizing our physical footprint, including the planning and construction of new stores and distribution facilities, along with our investments to maintain and enhance the productivity of our existing buildings.\n Of course, all of these aspects of operations matter all year long. But in the fourth quarter, when we handle the largest volumes of the year, everything moves faster, making the need for detailed planning and precise execution even greater. That's why, every year, we construct our plans with the fourth quarter in mind so we can remove distractions and roadblocks in advance of the holiday peak. That means on the properties team, we plan our remodeling new store projects so they're completed before the holidays. And our technology team rolls out new systems and tools on the same time line. In the supply chain and in our stores, we carefully plan the ramp-up of seasonal hiring and team member training in advance of the holidays so everyone is ready to handle the additional volume. \n That's what happens every year. But as Brian and Christina have already mentioned, this year, our teams have been facing additional out-of-the-ordinary challenges as they plan for and deliver record-setting volumes while facing unprecedented bottlenecks in the global supply chain. So while I'm lucky to work with our amazing team every day, it's at times like these that our team shines brightest. \n Beyond their skill and expertise, they face every challenge with good nature and a collaborative mindset. I can't describe how proud I am to represent everything they've accomplished this year, as they've delivered historically strong growth on top of record increases a year ago. \n Within our supply chain, the team has been methodically working around multiple obstacles and challenges throughout the network, prioritizing our holiday-sensitive categories within our import receipts, while thoughtfully planning domestic transportation to ensure products reach the shelf at the right time. And while we continue to see some periodic outages across different items and categories, we're entering the holidays with a very healthy inventory position overall. \n Specifically, at the end of the third quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was more than $2 billion higher than last year, representing growth of about 18% from a year ago. Looking back to the pre-COVID period, our Q3 ending inventory has grown more than $3.5 billion since the end of Q3 2019, representing 31% growth over a 2-year period. A sizable amount of this inventory will continue to flow to our stores over the next few weeks. And our team has clear visibility to where the inventory is located and when it will arrive in our stores. \n In our overseas operations, we've benefited from a significant reduction in delay times. And of course, given that we were already anticipating tight conditions many months ago, the team has been writing this year's holiday purchase orders much earlier than last year to proactively mitigate the risk of both known and unexpected delays. \n We're also benefiting from really strong performance across our domestic transportation network. And we've secured the necessary capacity across both rail and over-the-road trucking to accommodate anticipated shipments throughout the fourth quarter. \n At the intersection of our overseas and domestic supply chains, the team continues to work around significant port delays, diverting shipments to less congested entry points and relying on air freight in certain cases. And while Target's port operations have long been considered best-in-class, our team has been actively collaborating with government and port officials to help find solutions that will allow everyone's containers to move through the ports more quickly. And we're encouraged with the changes that have recently been put in place. \n I also want to pause and emphasize the ongoing collaboration that's been happening between our supply chain, merchandising and marketing teams. These teams have worked together to develop promotional and marketing plans that are much more fluid and nimble than in the past, enabling the incorporation of real-time data on inventory availability and location within our holiday plans in order to maximize their impact to the benefit of both our guests and operations. \n In our stores, the team has been preparing for fourth quarter all year. And they're energized and ready to serve our guests throughout the season. This will be the first holiday season since we launched our new service initiative, which is all about empowering our teams and increasing their confidence to build authentic connections with our guests. Also new this year, we've rolled out a new point-of-sale system across more than 90% of our stores, providing more speed, efficiency and enhanced experience at both the checkout and our service counter. \n To continue building on our industry-leading in-store Pickup and Drive Up experiences, we've been rolling out new capabilities all year. These efforts include capital projects to add permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high-volume stores, investing in flexible fixtures to provide temporary storage areas to support seasonal peak, adding thousands of new items to the list available for Pickup and Drive Up, doubling the number of Drive Up parking stalls compared with last year, and designating stall numbers to help our teams deliver Drive Up orders more efficiently. \n Even as we're adding these new capabilities, we're also supporting our long-standing commitment to providing a safe shopping experience, maintaining the enhanced COVID cleaning and safety routines that we implemented throughout the pandemic. We've also been investing in team member hours, processes and training to prepare our team to handle record freight and fulfillment volumes this year, all while enhancing safety messaging and actively monitoring processes to protect the safety of both our guests and our team. \n And of course, as Brian mentioned, our team is focused on being fully staffed across the store and supply chain throughout the holiday season. Our stores have been hitting their seasonal hiring milestones. And because of the advancements we've made in scheduling this year, average hours per store team member are running significantly higher this year in comparison to past years. In fact, unlike what you're hearing from many others, because of the investments we've made in pay and benefits and our focus on team member training and engagement, the hourly turnover rate in our stores is actually running lower this year compared with 2019, particularly for our newly hired team members. \n And we're continuing to invest in our team. Following the recent rollout of the most comprehensive debt-free education program in the industry, we announced that to sustain our momentum through the holidays, we're offering pay premiums during peak periods in our stores and distribution centers over the holiday season. As we've said many times, our investments in the team are the most productive ones we've made. \n Turning to the work of the properties team. We expect to finish about 145 remodels in 2021, having completed more than 40 remodels prior to the end of Q3, with more than 100 additional projects slated to wrap up before the holiday. The team also opened another 15 new stores in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total up to 30. Among those projects, we've opened new stores ranging from 11,000 to 160,000 square feet, which demonstrates the flexibility we've developed to design the optimal store size for an individual neighborhood, based on their local needs and available real estate in the market. \n To increase the capacity and efficiency of our supply chain, our team has also opened 2 new distribution centers this year. In addition, we have 2 new sortation centers set to open in the fourth quarter, with 2 more on track to open early next year. \n While our supply chain has had to address a host of unique challenges, I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of our construction team, which enabled them to successfully bring a huge number of store and distribution projects to completion this year. These are highly complex projects across multiple geographies, which require precise coordination across a large number of regional construction providers, along with a diverse group of fixture and equipment vendors, all of whom have been facing the same bottlenecks we've been facing in our merchandise supply chain. Our construction team has handled all of these challenges with good humor and resilience, allowing us to continue reaching guests in new neighborhoods and support the growing supply chain needs of the entire chain. \n In support of those growing needs, we recently announced that we're adding more than 30,000 permanent positions across our supply chain network to support the growth we expect to continue delivering in the fourth quarter and beyond. These team members will support new buildings in our regional DC network, adding replenishment capacity to support an increasingly productive store network. They'll also be staffing and supporting our new sortation centers, which deliver efficiency, speed and additional capacity in support of last-mile fulfillment. \n And it's amazing to pause and look back at how much our network needs have grown in a short time. For the entire fiscal year in 2018, our business generated $74 billion in sales. Less than 3 years later, our business had already delivered $74 billion in sales through the third quarter, with the biggest quarter of the year still ahead of us. Our team and supply chain infrastructure have done an outstanding job in supporting that growth. And given that we don't expect it to end anytime soon, we are committed to growing our physical footprint and our team so they can continue to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders in Q4 and beyond. \n When I first started working here in 1996, Target delivered just under $18 billion in revenue, for what was then called Dayton Hudson Corporation. While many things have changed since then, both in retail and at this company, we successfully maintained what's made Target successful and unique for nearly 60 years. We've maintained our focus on offering affordable design in support of a unique merchandise assortment, providing a differentiated and outstanding shopping experience, investing in the best team in retail and giving back to the communities that sustain us. \n This is another example of what we call the power of 'and'. The reason Target has stayed relevant for so many decades is our ability to stay true to our values and continually evolve in the way we serve our guests. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. Over time, we've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business, ones that will deepen Target's relationship with our guests, driving engagement, which ultimately leads them to shop at Target more often. And while it's our job to focus on driving performance every day, we've committed to making investment decisions with a long-term perspective, not limiting our horizon to a month, a season, a quarter or even a year, but thinking about how to position Target as a leading retailer for generations. \n That's how I think about our third quarter. In the face of multiple challenges in the external environment, we maintained our focus on our guests and took specific actions to ensure we have a healthy inventory position going into the holidays, even though those actions involve some incremental cost. And importantly, as we face those decisions, we had the resources we needed, including the best team in retail, a sophisticated global supply chain and a durable model that could accommodate those guest-focused investments. \n And while we're making these decisions with a focus on the long term, we've already seen the benefit of this year's inventory investments, given that they helped to power third quarter traffic and sales growth that exceeded our expectations. In addition, given strong expense discipline across the organization, we benefited from a compelling amount of leverage on our SG&A and D&A expenses, resulting in solid EPS growth despite the sizable investments we were choosing to make. \n As Brian mentioned, our 12.7% comp in the third quarter came on top of a nearly 21% increase a year ago. As expected, within the quarter, we saw a shift in a portion of our back-to-school sales back into August, given that most schools across the country began the school year with in-person learning. As a result, our August comp was our strongest of the quarter, our September comp dipped down to about 10%, and we accelerated back into the low teens in October. \n Among the component drivers of our sales, growth continues to be driven by traffic, even as we retain nearly all of the basket growth that happened a year ago. Specifically, third quarter traffic increased 12.9% on top of a 4.5% increase last year, while average ticket declined only slightly, about 20 basis points, after growing more than 15% a year ago. Among our sales channels, stores comparable sales grew 9.7% in the quarter, on top of 9.9% last year, while digital comp sales grew 29%, on top of 155% growth a year ago. \n Within our digital fulfillment, sales on orders shipped to home increased slightly over last year, while same-day services grew about 60%, on top of a more than 200% increase a year ago. Among those same-day options, both in-store Pickup and Shipt grew more than 30% in the quarter, while Drive Up grew more than 80%, on top of more than 500% a year ago. Put another way, since 2019, sales through Drive Up have expanded more than 10x or about $1.4 billion in the third quarter alone. \n Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter gross margin rate of 28% was 2.6 percentage points lower than a year ago. Among the drivers, core merchandising accounted for 2 percentage points or more than 3/4 of the rate decline, driven primarily by incremental freight and other inventory costs. Among the other gross margin drivers, payroll growth in our supply chain accounted for about 70 basis points of pressure, while category sales mix contributed about 10 basis points of benefit. \n Notably, digital fulfillment had an approximately neutral impact on gross margin rate in the quarter, as the costs associated with higher digital volume were offset by the benefit of a shift in fulfillment mix towards our same-day options, which have meaningfully lower average unit costs compared with traditional e-commerce. \n On the SG&A expense line, we saw about 160 basis points of improvement in the third quarter, reflecting disciplined cost management, combined with the leverage benefit of unexpectedly strong sales. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement, as sales growth more than offset the impact of higher accelerated depreciation, which reflects the continued ramp-up in our remodel program. \n Altogether, our third quarter operating margin rate of 7.8% was about 70 basis points lower than a year ago, but more than 2 percentage points higher than 2 years ago. On a dollar basis, operating income was 3.9% higher than a year ago and double the number recorded in the third quarter of 2019. \n Moving to the bottom of the P&L. Our third quarter GAAP EPS of $3.04 was 52% higher than last year when we recorded more than $500 million of interest expense on early debt retirement. On the adjusted EPS line, where we excluded early debt retirement expense, we earned $3.03 in the quarter, representing an 8.7% increase from a year ago. Compared with 2 years ago, both GAAP and adjusted EPS have increased more than 120%. \n Turning now to capital deployment. I'm going to start, as always, with our long-term priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we support the dividend and look to build on our long history of annual increases, which we maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we're returning the excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time. \n On the CapEx line, we'd invested $2.5 billion through the first 3 quarters of 2021 and expect to reach about $3.3 billion for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, this is somewhat lower than our expectation going into the year and reflects the retiming of project spending into next year, given that we've experienced delays on some projects relating to external factors like permitting and inspections in some communities. \n However, as John mentioned earlier, we're eager to invest in a long list of productive growth opportunities over the next few years: adding new stores, remodeling existing stores, building replenishment capacity in our supply chain, and rolling out additional sortation centers. As of today, we continue to believe these investments will amount to CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range in 2022, and we'll continue to refine our view in the months ahead. \n Turning now to dividends. We paid $440 million in dividends in the third quarter, up $100 million from last year. This increase reflects a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. I want to pause here and take note of the fact that, with the payment of our December dividend, we'll officially achieve our 50th consecutive year of annual increases in the per share dividend, something very few companies have achieved. \n And lastly, given our cash position and strong cash generation by our operations, we continue to have ample capacity for share repurchases within the limits of our middle A ratings, even after we've made robust investments in CapEx and dividends. In the third quarter, we deployed $2.2 billion to repurchase 8.8 million of our shares, bringing our year-to-date total up to $4.9 billion. \n As I've mentioned in prior quarters, given our continued strong financial performance, our debt leverage has been lower and cash on the balance sheet has been higher than we'd expect to maintain over the longer term. As a result, going forward, we expect to increase our leverage and reduce our cash position at a pace that's consistent with our financial expectations, credit rating goals and assessment of the external environment. \n I've mentioned before that the time line to move those metrics fully back to historical levels will likely be a multiyear journey. And the rapidly changing conditions we've seen over the last 2 years demonstrate why it's prudent to maintain a thoughtful pace. \n As always, I'll end my review of performance with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the quality of our current performance in the context of the investments we've made over time. For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q3, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 31.3% compared with 19.9% a year ago. This is incredibly robust performance and demonstrates why we are enthusiastically planning to continue investing in our business. \n Now let me turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. 90 days ago, we said we were planning for high single-digit growth in our comparable sales over the back half of the year. While we still believe that's in the range of possible outcomes for the fourth quarter, we just exceeded that expectation in Q3. As such, we're planning for a Q4 comp in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, consistent with the range we've seen over the last 2 quarters. \n In terms of profitability, we continue to expect that our business will deliver a full year operating margin rate of 8% or higher, up significantly from 7% in 2020. This rate favorability, combined with the full year sales growth we're positioned to deliver, would translate into another incredibly strong year of profit growth, following a record year in 2020. \n So now as I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to pause and address a question that I'm certain you'll be asking, which is, how much of the current cost pressures will turn out to be temporary and how much will turn out to be structural? And I'll give you the honest answer, which is that it's almost certainly some of both. And no one knows the precise answer. \n That said, there's no doubt that supply chain bottlenecks should ease over time. However, beyond the supply chain, we're also facing product cost increases from some vendors, driven by higher costs in their businesses. And while you heard from John that we're extremely well positioned given our team investments over the last few years, the labor market remains very tight across the country. \n So how do we think about the future? From a financial standpoint, we focus first on serving our guests and translating that focus into further growth, an area where we see a lot of runway. As you've seen with the investments we've made and continue to make, we're earning deeper trust and engagement from our guests. This trust leads to more trips and broader shopping across our merchandise assortment and fulfillment services. \n With a skilled and agile team focused on driving guest engagement, further growth and market share gains, we're confident that our durable model can continue to offer compelling value for our guests, accommodate continued investments in our team and deliver outstanding financial performance, even in the face of a challenging external environment like we're facing today. This is one more example of the power of 'and'. \n So now I want to pause and thank our entire team for delivering a great Q3, which came on top of years of already strong performance. The financial results I have the privilege of sharing quarter after quarter wouldn't be possible if Target didn't have the best team in retail. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to pick up on something Michael just mentioned, which is the growing agility of our team. This comes in part from a heightened focus on prioritization in which we ask our team to focus on a small list of key enterprise-wide priorities, with a goal of making much more rapid progress towards the goals that matter most. \n With prioritization, we've also seen more alignment across the organization. Regardless of where specific team members might work, our enterprise priorities guide their decision-making, allowing them to take action and change course faster when facing rapidly changing external conditions. \n Beyond prioritization and alignment, we've also achieved a higher degree of collaboration. When tackling business problems, it becomes easier for everyone to communicate and partner cross-functionally to achieve our common goals together. \n Prioritization, alignment, collaboration, 3 important concepts that deliver compelling outcomes in a large organization like ours. And in our remarks today, you've heard us highlight some of those benefits, which helped drive strong Q3 performance despite challenging macro conditions: a unified focus on serving our guests; collaboration between merchandising, marketing and operations teams as they optimize holiday promotions; joint efforts between our stores, supply chain, merchants and vendors to address supply chain bottlenecks and find solutions in support of our inventory. \n To say we're feeling the impact of those benefits already this holiday season would be an understatement. In fact, I place them alongside our multi-category portfolio, our unmatched same-day services and the skill of our extraordinary team as keys to our holiday readiness. \n So once again, I want to thank our team. There is no question that because of their dedication and connection to our guests, we stand ready for an exceptionally strong holiday season. Throughout the team, across every function, I've seen the energy and passion as they prepare for the busiest season of the year. And I'm confident that same energy and passion will ensure Target's consistent and sustainable growth over the longer term as well. \n Now Christina, John, Michael and I would be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Michael, you began the question already by suggesting you're not sure how long the gross margin is going to last. Can you at least help us understand if the third quarter was the peak gross margin degradation that you expect to realize over the next few quarters? And what are you doing to mitigate this gross margin pressure in terms of passing along price increases to the consumer? \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks for the question, Michael. As you know, we don't guide margins specifically out into future quarters. But I will say and reiterate what I said in my remarks. I think you're seeing in the third quarter, the result of some very specific investments we made. And the biggest of those investments is an investment to make sure we've got a great inventory position heading into the fourth quarter. And pulling all the levers within the system to ensure we're there for the guest has been our priority. And some of those levers, think of expediting product to come at a cost, and you saw some of that in the third quarter. \n But I feel really good about the payoff from an investment decision like that. We've got inventory of $2 billion north of last year, up almost 20% on a year-over-year basis. And that's fueling the continued top line growth that we see. So I feel really good about the set of investments that we're making and how they have us positioned for the back part of the year. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, even without providing any context on the gross margin for at least the fourth quarter, can you give us a sense for how much you're able to offset or continue to offset this gross margin pressure with further SG&A reductions? Should we expect your SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter to grow at a similar rate that they grew in the third quarter? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. On the SG&A side, I think the theme you see in Q3 is just an example of how powerful productivity improvements that come with growth are for our business. We generate astounding leverage when the top line is running forcibly in the right direction, and it certainly was in the third quarter. That's one of the reasons. We want to make sure we're so well positioned to support continued growth because the P&L works great when we're generating that SG&A leverage, just like you saw in Q3. \nOperator: The next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So 2 question. My first question is, you raised the outlook for the fourth quarter, can you talk about what you're seeing from the consumer so far this holiday season? Are you seeing any indication of that holiday sales could be pulled forward? And does the guidance reflect any risk on stock-outs as we progress toward Christmas and then, obviously, stimulus slap in January? \nBrian Cornell: Chris, as we sit here today, we see continued momentum in the marketplace, and our guests to shopping, all of our categories, utilizing both our stores and our digital channels, and we think that's going to continue throughout the holiday season. All indications are that the U.S. consumers looking to celebrate the holiday season, they are anxious to get together with family and friends. We've seen a great response to seasonal activity as we look at the first 3 quarters of the year. Record Halloween season, very strong back-to-school, back-to-college, a guest that we believe is going to enjoy Thanksgiving with family and friends and is really looking forward to the holiday season, which means robust gifting throughout the season. \n So we're off to a very good start. We think that's going to continue throughout the holiday season. And we think we made the appropriate investments in inventory. Our inventory levels are up $2 billion, almost 20%. And we think we're well positioned with those key items. The gifting items, the toys, those items the guest is going to turn to celebrate the season to make sure we build on our third quarter momentum and continue to take market share as we go through the holiday season. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then I'll take a second cut probably of many on the gross margin and the gross margin outlook. Seasonally, usually, gross margin does sort of go down 200, 300 basis points just relative to the third quarter rate. However, you talked about a lot of -- I think there's like 2 components here to think about. One, you talked a lot about expediting product in during the third quarter. So there are some sort of periodic costs there. \n But then you have a lot of the product that comes in overseas, has all that ocean freight. And I think that product is hung up -- that cost is hung up in the inventory. So I guess as you sort of roll those 2 pieces together, and ignoring mix for a second, how are you thinking about those 2 relative costs? As sort of the freight component that's hung up in inventory get worse, but the periodic cost of bringing in 3Q comes down and those 2 things sort of net to neutral, or in which direction? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Chris, we -- you're thinking about it conceptually, I'd say, in the right way, in that the third quarter and fourth quarter kind of straddle the big inventory build and relief that happens for us in advance of the holiday season every year. And so those will be the factors at play, while I won't begin to get into the specifics of that level of gross margin for what that means in Q4. But I just zoom out and I feel really good about our ability to manage all of the levers and to see EPS growth of almost 9% in the third quarter, and yes, some investment in gross margin, but also a ton of leverage on the SG&A line. And we feel really good about how that positions us for the fourth quarter and the investments in inventory. And importantly, the investments in value for our guests, I think, will be investments that continue to pay off. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: Sorry to try this a little bit differently. So when you look at your top line growth in 3Q relative to your EBIT growth, and then -- so we look at the gap on those 2 in 3Q, and then back into 4Q, it looks like you will have much stronger -- a much wider -- or sorry, a much narrower gap on top line relative to EBIT growth in 4Q. So is that a function of the fact that a lot of the supply chain costs and inventory costs were pulled into 3Q? And then I guess what I want to ask bigger picture is, looking at '22, how should we think about that algorithm generally, top line growth relative to EBIT growth? \nMichael Fiddelke: Well, thanks for the question, Karen. It's -- I guess I'd start by saying it's wrapped into the guidance we've given for the balance of the year. We would expect op income rate of 8% or higher. And that's inclusive of a lot of moving pieces and puts and takes throughout the P&L. But I'll tell you the place that starts is growth, and that's why high single-digit to low double-digit expectations for the fourth quarter are kind of where the short-term algorithm starts. And with that kind of growth, we feel confident in our ability to put together a P&L that works. \n The time will be right in the future to unpack the future year algorithm. But I will say, over time, we expect to be a growth company. We expect to be a company that's growing the top line and gaining share over time. And that's where that algorithm will start. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then just a follow-up. You didn't mention markdowns or what your thoughts are on overall markdowns. I know originally, you'd hope that you would have enough excess inventory to be able to have a healthier markdown season. Just wondering where you stand on that. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I describe us as still chasing. The strength in the top line means that we're still not seeing those clearance markdowns return in force, like you've heard me talk about quarter-over-quarter. And so that said, we feel really good about how inventory is positioned for the fourth quarter. And so that $2 billion higher than last year, up almost 20%, it means we'll be ready to serve our guests for the important holiday season. \nOperator: The next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted to ask really about the competitive environment. And clearly, you're maybe not passing on all the cost pressures that maybe you could. And my understanding is you're kind of investing here in that relationship with your guests. But do you see this as an investment to sustain these share gains? Or are you already seeing any signs of consumer price sensitivity? Or is it just an anticipation of that as we move forward and this is maybe more of a proactive absorption of those costs here? \nBrian Cornell: Kelly, you've heard us say a number of times already today, we're investing in growth. We're investing to maintain and continue to build market share positions and build on the extraordinary results that we delivered last year, where we added $9 billion of market share and continue to see that momentum grow in 2021. So we're a company that's going to continue to invest in growth, do the right thing for our team, the right thing for the guest, and utilize all of our assets to continue to build on the momentum that we have today and build market share across all of our key categories. \nKelly Bania: That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on the supply chain. Obviously, you've been ahead of that year -- ahead of it this year and pulling inventory ahead of schedule. What is your expectation on when that resolves? And are you still pulling inventory ahead of schedule for early next year? \nBrian Cornell: Kelly, I'll start, and then I'll ask John to provide any additional comments. But we've certainly seen supply chain challenges going all the way to the start of the pandemic as demand across the U.S. continued to build. So we've done a terrific job. And I think our teams have shown great agility. They've adjusted to the marketplace to make sure that we've been able to meet the demand in our system. But we don't expect those supply chain challenges to go away as we go into the start of next year. And I think they'll dissipate over time. \n So we're doing our fair share to make sure that we're alleviating some of the congestion in the ports and making sure that we're unpacking containers and off-peak hours. We've utilized other ports across the country to try to relieve some of the congestion in L.A. Long Beach. But as John can attest, we know that we're going to still face some supply chain challenges as we go into 2022. There's still uncertainty as we think about supply from Asia as different factories from time to time are closed. And we're just going to have to show great flexibility and agility to provide the products that our guests are looking for and our system requires as we plan for the next fiscal year. \nOperator: The next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wanted to ask a quick question on labor. It sounds from the prepared comments, that from a staffing level, you might be in a good place right now. Could you maybe comment on how you're feeling about your labor in the stores versus the DCs, and what you're seeing in the competitive environment when it comes to wages? \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Kate, I think we feel really good about where we're at. And this really goes back a little bit like the supply chain thing. This is something we've been on top of for a very long time. We've made investing in our team an absolute priority. You've seen us do that for years now, investments in wage, investments in training, investments in benefits and investments in their safety over the past couple of years. \n And so that all starts and leads to retaining our current team. And from our perspective, that's the way we achieve our staffing goals, is retain the team we have. This year, particularly in our stores, we spent a lot of time, individual conversations with every team member about what's the hours they want and what can we do to cross-train you to get you the hours you need. And so that's been a huge success for our team and for us as we've looked at staffing.\n More recently, we've said we're investing in our DC team, our supply chain teams to grow the staffing, and we feel great about applicant flow. We feel great about the turnover of our team. It's below 2019 right now. So overall, we feel we're really well positioned for the fourth quarter, and more importantly, for beyond the fourth quarter, because labor is going to continue to be tight, and we'll continue to focus on retaining our existing team. \nOperator: The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: I know you don't give guidance. Obviously, you didn't for third quarter gross margin. I'm sure you had some view on where it would shake out. So I'm kind of curious just how much of what we saw in the third quarter was unexpected to you and maybe tied to decisions that you made during the quarter, intra-quarter and how much was tied to higher-than-expected sales. \n And I just want to make sure I'm clear. I don't know if you'd answered the question earlier, was there an aspect of some costs getting pulled forward into 3Q out of 4Q? \nBrian Cornell: I'll start. I think one of the positive surprises for us in Q3 was just the continued strength in traffic. To see our traffic grow by almost 13% was something that we actually didn't anticipate. We certainly were planning for a very strong quarter and continued market share gains. \n But to see the type of performance across our business, the strength of stores, comping up almost 10%, in a period when we were comping over a 9.9% growth rate in the prior year, to see our digital business grow by almost 30%, comping over 155% growth the year before, those numbers are actually stronger than we might have expected. To see the consistent growth across every one of our major merchandising categories, double-digit growth, just the way the guest was responding to our assortment, the value we were delivering, the great in-store experience, those were all really positive results in the quarter and actually exceeded our expectations when we were planning for Q3.\n Operator, we have time for 1 more question today. \nOperator: Our last question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Brian, I -- kind of a follow-up to what you were just talking about. I wanted to ask you about grocery. I know that Target historically has said, we're not a full grocery shop. But I'm looking at the numbers you guys have been putting up in grocery, Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials. And can you maybe just speak to longer-term opportunity given the momentum you have there? And could you do more there? And maybe also, does it tie into -- does it drive general merchandise? Is it key to driving these digital numbers on very strong digital numbers? Any help to think about that would be great. \nBrian Cornell: Robbie, why don't I start and let Christina add to my comments. But I think you've highlighted one of the real success stories within our business over the last few years. And the progress we've made from a Food & Beverage standpoint, the changes we've made in assortment, the market share gains that we've seen quarter after quarter now for multiple years, and the great response we're seeing to our own brands, and the strength and response we're seeing to Good & Gather is a real highlight for us. \n But as Christina can build in more detail, we're also seeing tremendous growth in our Beauty business, and ongoing strength in Household Essentials. And that's helping drive trips and leads to cross shopping across our multi-category portfolio. So the position we're in today in Food & Beverage is dramatically different from where we were 5 years ago. We're connecting with the guest. The quality, the assortment, the value we deliver is being really well received from the guest who shops our stores. And we're seeing accelerated growth with our Food & Beverage business from a digital standpoint. \nA. Hennington: I was just going to add a little bit of commentary to Brian's point about how Food & Beverage fits into the broad portfolio. The multi-category portfolio and the strength across the entirety is part of Target's sweet spot. So Food & Beverage is certainly an incredible proof point that's grown and driven share acceleration and traffic, but we rely on all of our categories to play that role at different times of year. And it's that combination that makes it so compelling whether it's back-to-school whether it's Halloween, whether it's Memorial Day or whether it's just your everyday trip when you need to pick up milk and bread. So this is part of the strategy that's accelerating the relevance for the consumer across the board. \nBrian Cornell: Robbie, thank you. And that, operator, concludes our third quarter conference call. We look forward to talking to all of you as we go into 2022. So thank you.",

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. Every day, across the operations team, we focus on execution. On our supply chain team, the focus is on moving the right amount of inventory to the right place at the right time. In our stores, which fulfill more than 95% of our total sales, the team focuses on delivering a great guest experience across hundreds of millions of guest transactions every quarter. And on our properties team, the team focuses on optimizing our physical footprint, including the planning and construction of new stores and distribution facilities, along with our investments to maintain and enhance the productivity of our existing buildings.\n Of course, all of these aspects of operations matter all year long. But in the fourth quarter, when we handle the largest volumes of the year, everything moves faster, making the need for detailed planning and precise execution even greater. That's why, every year, we construct our plans with the fourth quarter in mind so we can remove distractions and roadblocks in advance of the holiday peak. That means on the properties team, we plan our remodeling new store projects so they're completed before the holidays. And our technology team rolls out new systems and tools on the same time line. In the supply chain and in our stores, we carefully plan the ramp-up of seasonal hiring and team member training in advance of the holidays so everyone is ready to handle the additional volume. \n That's what happens every year. But as Brian and Christina have already mentioned, this year, our teams have been facing additional out-of-the-ordinary challenges as they plan for and deliver record-setting volumes while facing unprecedented bottlenecks in the global supply chain. So while I'm lucky to work with our amazing team every day, it's at times like these that our team shines brightest. \n Beyond their skill and expertise, they face every challenge with good nature and a collaborative mindset. I can't describe how proud I am to represent everything they've accomplished this year, as they've delivered historically strong growth on top of record increases a year ago. \n Within our supply chain, the team has been methodically working around multiple obstacles and challenges throughout the network, prioritizing our holiday-sensitive categories within our import receipts, while thoughtfully planning domestic transportation to ensure products reach the shelf at the right time. And while we continue to see some periodic outages across different items and categories, we're entering the holidays with a very healthy inventory position overall. \n Specifically, at the end of the third quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was more than $2 billion higher than last year, representing growth of about 18% from a year ago. Looking back to the pre-COVID period, our Q3 ending inventory has grown more than $3.5 billion since the end of Q3 2019, representing 31% growth over a 2-year period. A sizable amount of this inventory will continue to flow to our stores over the next few weeks. And our team has clear visibility to where the inventory is located and when it will arrive in our stores. \n In our overseas operations, we've benefited from a significant reduction in delay times. And of course, given that we were already anticipating tight conditions many months ago, the team has been writing this year's holiday purchase orders much earlier than last year to proactively mitigate the risk of both known and unexpected delays. \n We're also benefiting from really strong performance across our domestic transportation network. And we've secured the necessary capacity across both rail and over-the-road trucking to accommodate anticipated shipments throughout the fourth quarter. \n At the intersection of our overseas and domestic supply chains, the team continues to work around significant port delays, diverting shipments to less congested entry points and relying on air freight in certain cases. And while Target's port operations have long been considered best-in-class, our team has been actively collaborating with government and port officials to help find solutions that will allow everyone's containers to move through the ports more quickly. And we're encouraged with the changes that have recently been put in place. \n I also want to pause and emphasize the ongoing collaboration that's been happening between our supply chain, merchandising and marketing teams. These teams have worked together to develop promotional and marketing plans that are much more fluid and nimble than in the past, enabling the incorporation of real-time data on inventory availability and location within our holiday plans in order to maximize their impact to the benefit of both our guests and operations. \n In our stores, the team has been preparing for fourth quarter all year. And they're energized and ready to serve our guests throughout the season. This will be the first holiday season since we launched our new service initiative, which is all about empowering our teams and increasing their confidence to build authentic connections with our guests. Also new this year, we've rolled out a new point-of-sale system across more than 90% of our stores, providing more speed, efficiency and enhanced experience at both the checkout and our service counter. \n To continue building on our industry-leading in-store Pickup and Drive Up experiences, we've been rolling out new capabilities all year. These efforts include capital projects to add permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high-volume stores, investing in flexible fixtures to provide temporary storage areas to support seasonal peak, adding thousands of new items to the list available for Pickup and Drive Up, doubling the number of Drive Up parking stalls compared with last year, and designating stall numbers to help our teams deliver Drive Up orders more efficiently. \n Even as we're adding these new capabilities, we're also supporting our long-standing commitment to providing a safe shopping experience, maintaining the enhanced COVID cleaning and safety routines that we implemented throughout the pandemic. We've also been investing in team member hours, processes and training to prepare our team to handle record freight and fulfillment volumes this year, all while enhancing safety messaging and actively monitoring processes to protect the safety of both our guests and our team. \n And of course, as Brian mentioned, our team is focused on being fully staffed across the store and supply chain throughout the holiday season. Our stores have been hitting their seasonal hiring milestones. And because of the advancements we've made in scheduling this year, average hours per store team member are running significantly higher this year in comparison to past years. In fact, unlike what you're hearing from many others, because of the investments we've made in pay and benefits and our focus on team member training and engagement, the hourly turnover rate in our stores is actually running lower this year compared with 2019, particularly for our newly hired team members. \n And we're continuing to invest in our team. Following the recent rollout of the most comprehensive debt-free education program in the industry, we announced that to sustain our momentum through the holidays, we're offering pay premiums during peak periods in our stores and distribution centers over the holiday season. As we've said many times, our investments in the team are the most productive ones we've made. \n Turning to the work of the properties team. We expect to finish about 145 remodels in 2021, having completed more than 40 remodels prior to the end of Q3, with more than 100 additional projects slated to wrap up before the holiday. The team also opened another 15 new stores in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total up to 30. Among those projects, we've opened new stores ranging from 11,000 to 160,000 square feet, which demonstrates the flexibility we've developed to design the optimal store size for an individual neighborhood, based on their local needs and available real estate in the market. \n To increase the capacity and efficiency of our supply chain, our team has also opened 2 new distribution centers this year. In addition, we have 2 new sortation centers set to open in the fourth quarter, with 2 more on track to open early next year. \n While our supply chain has had to address a host of unique challenges, I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of our construction team, which enabled them to successfully bring a huge number of store and distribution projects to completion this year. These are highly complex projects across multiple geographies, which require precise coordination across a large number of regional construction providers, along with a diverse group of fixture and equipment vendors, all of whom have been facing the same bottlenecks we've been facing in our merchandise supply chain. Our construction team has handled all of these challenges with good humor and resilience, allowing us to continue reaching guests in new neighborhoods and support the growing supply chain needs of the entire chain. \n In support of those growing needs, we recently announced that we're adding more than 30,000 permanent positions across our supply chain network to support the growth we expect to continue delivering in the fourth quarter and beyond. These team members will support new buildings in our regional DC network, adding replenishment capacity to support an increasingly productive store network. They'll also be staffing and supporting our new sortation centers, which deliver efficiency, speed and additional capacity in support of last-mile fulfillment. \n And it's amazing to pause and look back at how much our network needs have grown in a short time. For the entire fiscal year in 2018, our business generated $74 billion in sales. Less than 3 years later, our business had already delivered $74 billion in sales through the third quarter, with the biggest quarter of the year still ahead of us. Our team and supply chain infrastructure have done an outstanding job in supporting that growth. And given that we don't expect it to end anytime soon, we are committed to growing our physical footprint and our team so they can continue to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders in Q4 and beyond. \n When I first started working here in 1996, Target delivered just under $18 billion in revenue, for what was then called Dayton Hudson Corporation. While many things have changed since then, both in retail and at this company, we successfully maintained what's made Target successful and unique for nearly 60 years. We've maintained our focus on offering affordable design in support of a unique merchandise assortment, providing a differentiated and outstanding shopping experience, investing in the best team in retail and giving back to the communities that sustain us. \n This is another example of what we call the power of 'and'. The reason Target has stayed relevant for so many decades is our ability to stay true to our values and continually evolve in the way we serve our guests. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Yes. Kate, I think we feel really good about where we're at. And this really goes back a little bit like the supply chain thing. This is something we've been on top of for a very long time. We've made investing in our team an absolute priority. You've seen us do that for years now, investments in wage, investments in training, investments in benefits and investments in their safety over the past couple of years. \n And so that all starts and leads to retaining our current team. And from our perspective, that's the way we achieve our staffing goals, is retain the team we have. This year, particularly in our stores, we spent a lot of time, individual conversations with every team member about what's the hours they want and what can we do to cross-train you to get you the hours you need. And so that's been a huge success for our team and for us as we've looked at staffing.\n More recently, we've said we're investing in our DC team, our supply chain teams to grow the staffing, and we feel great about applicant flow. We feel great about the turnover of our team. It's below 2019 right now. So overall, we feel we're really well positioned for the fourth quarter, and more importantly, for beyond the fourth quarter, because labor is going to continue to be tight, and we'll continue to focus on retaining our existing team."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are consistent with what our team has been delivering quarter after quarter for years now. And they continue to demonstrate the extraordinary level of engagement we're seeing from our guests, both with our brand and with our team. \n In the third quarter, comparable sales expanded 12.7%, on top of a nearly 21% increase one year ago. Consistent with recent quarters, traffic was the primary driver of this year's growth as our guests increasingly turned to Target to serve their wants and needs. Across our sales channels, store sales were the primary growth driver this quarter, while same-day services propelled our digital growth. \n Since the third quarter of 2019, prior to the pandemic, Q3 store sales have expanded by $3.8 billion, while digital sales have increased another $3.1 billion. This provides a vivid demonstration of the flexibility of our operating model to serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop. All of these results reflect the level of guest engagement far beyond what many would have imagined a few years ago, when we started making huge investments throughout our business, in our stores, new brands, same-day services, supply chain, and importantly, our team. \n Back then, Target was already known for our world-class team, a differentiated shopping experience, unique assortment and an iconic brand. But we knew there was much more to do. We saw a clear opportunity to build on that solid foundation, finding new ways to enhance our capabilities, while strengthening the bond with both our team and our guests. And today, those bonds have never been stronger. As I mentioned, within our digital capabilities, more and more of our guests are trying and embracing our industry-leading same-day services. Third quarter sales through these services have expanded by nearly 400% or $2 billion over the last 2 years. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, sales through these services have grown by more than $6 billion since 2019, a number larger than the total sales of many prominent retailers. \n Beyond fulfillment capabilities, our balanced multi-category assortment is another key driver of flexibility and resiliency within our business model. The breadth of our assortment, both within and across our core categories, allows our team to quickly and seamlessly serve our guests, even when their wants and needs are changing rapidly. \n In the third quarter, we saw consistent strong growth across our entire merchandising portfolio. More specifically, all 5 of our core merchandise categories saw a double-digit growth in the quarter, ranging from the low double-digits to the mid-teens, resulting in strong market share gains on top of unprecedented share growth in 2020. \n And we're not slowing down in our efforts to serve our guests. We continue to invest in key partnerships that enhance our assortment and experience, including the opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops and our recent announcement that we're doubling the number of enhanced Apple experiences in electronics. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. \n In our conference call 3 months ago, we outlined multiple actions we're taking to support our inventory and in-stocks, given the supply chain challenges that have emerged throughout the pandemic. As you know, those pressures only intensified in the third quarter. And our team has done an outstanding job in the face of these challenges, identifying bottlenecks and finding solutions to keep inventory flowing throughout our network. \n Although efforts drove some incremental costs in the quarter, we view them as a continuation of the many productive long-term investments we're making in our business in support of the trust we have built with our guests. And obviously, our guests responded to these efforts with strong third quarter traffic, which we expect will continue in Q4 and beyond. \n Beyond our supply chain, the team has done a great job navigating through broader cost pressures as many vendors have raised wholesale prices to accommodate higher costs within their businesses. As our team faced these cost increases, they maintained a guest-first approach and a focus on value while managing overall profitability as well. As a result, our business delivered strong third quarter financial results, from the top to the bottom of the P&L, while building on the trust we've established with our guests. \n So I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of our teams across the company, from headquarters to stores, from our merchandising, distribution and transportation teams to our sourcing offices around the world. Because of your agility, energy and selfless collaboration, Target delivered for our guests and our shareholders in the third quarter. And as we enter the fourth quarter and ramp up for the peak holiday season, we're really well positioned to continue delivering for all of our stakeholders and close out an already amazing year. I want to thank you for everything you do. \n So the theme you'll hear in today's call is that we're excited and ready for the holiday season. We know our guests are excited to celebrate, following a year in 2020 when many families stayed apart due to safety concerns. This year, our guests have eagerly started their holiday shopping, as they respond to our holiday promotions, low price guarantees and our ongoing efforts to provide ease, reliability, safety and value across every shopping experience. \n And importantly, we have taken multiple actions to support our guests during the holiday season and beyond. On top of the investments in inventory, in-stocks and value I outlined earlier, we've announced that we're hiring 30,000 new year-round supply chain team members to support our current and expected growth. \n In our stores, we're providing our team members with more pay, flexibility and reliable hours this holiday season, offering more than 5 million additional hours to our existing team, and investment of more than $75 million over the holiday season. To supplement the additional hours from our existing team, we're hiring another 100,000 seasonal team members throughout the country, many of whom will have an opportunity to stay on with Target after the holidays. \n And importantly, during a season in which our guests are busier than any other time of the year, our merchandising and marketing teams are focused on cutting through the clutter. That means we're keeping our marketing messages and promotions simple and our operations flexible to offer an easy and reliable experience for our guests no matter how they choose to shop. \n And finally, while Target has already had an outstanding year, our team is looking ahead and not slowing down. We're continuing to invest in our future, in our new stores and existing stores, our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, in our owned and national brands, and the safety and well-being of our team. \n We're investing in Target Forward, an ambitious commitment to co-create an equitable and regenerative future. Together with our guests, partners and communities. All of these efforts are focused on advancing Target's leadership position within retail, taking a guest-led approach to everything we do and supporting our company values to care, grow and win together. \n I had the privilege of working alongside this great team as they bring our values to life every day across every part of the company. I'm endlessly grateful for their passion and support of our guests of our brand and for each other. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to pick up on something Michael just mentioned, which is the growing agility of our team. This comes in part from a heightened focus on prioritization in which we ask our team to focus on a small list of key enterprise-wide priorities, with a goal of making much more rapid progress towards the goals that matter most. \n With prioritization, we've also seen more alignment across the organization. Regardless of where specific team members might work, our enterprise priorities guide their decision-making, allowing them to take action and change course faster when facing rapidly changing external conditions. \n Beyond prioritization and alignment, we've also achieved a higher degree of collaboration. When tackling business problems, it becomes easier for everyone to communicate and partner cross-functionally to achieve our common goals together. \n Prioritization, alignment, collaboration, 3 important concepts that deliver compelling outcomes in a large organization like ours. And in our remarks today, you've heard us highlight some of those benefits, which helped drive strong Q3 performance despite challenging macro conditions: a unified focus on serving our guests; collaboration between merchandising, marketing and operations teams as they optimize holiday promotions; joint efforts between our stores, supply chain, merchants and vendors to address supply chain bottlenecks and find solutions in support of our inventory. \n To say we're feeling the impact of those benefits already this holiday season would be an understatement. In fact, I place them alongside our multi-category portfolio, our unmatched same-day services and the skill of our extraordinary team as keys to our holiday readiness. \n So once again, I want to thank our team. There is no question that because of their dedication and connection to our guests, we stand ready for an exceptionally strong holiday season. Throughout the team, across every function, I've seen the energy and passion as they prepare for the busiest season of the year. And I'm confident that same energy and passion will ensure Target's consistent and sustainable growth over the longer term as well. \n Now Christina, John, Michael and I would be happy to take your questions. Chris, as we sit here today, we see continued momentum in the marketplace, and our guests to shopping, all of our categories, utilizing both our stores and our digital channels, and we think that's going to continue throughout the holiday season. All indications are that the U.S. consumers looking to celebrate the holiday season, they are anxious to get together with family and friends. We've seen a great response to seasonal activity as we look at the first 3 quarters of the year. Record Halloween season, very strong back-to-school, back-to-college, a guest that we believe is going to enjoy Thanksgiving with family and friends and is really looking forward to the holiday season, which means robust gifting throughout the season. \n So we're off to a very good start. We think that's going to continue throughout the holiday season. And we think we made the appropriate investments in inventory. Our inventory levels are up $2 billion, almost 20%. And we think we're well positioned with those key items. The gifting items, the toys, those items the guest is going to turn to celebrate the season to make sure we build on our third quarter momentum and continue to take market share as we go through the holiday season. Kelly, you've heard us say a number of times already today, we're investing in growth. We're investing to maintain and continue to build market share positions and build on the extraordinary results that we delivered last year, where we added $9 billion of market share and continue to see that momentum grow in 2021. So we're a company that's going to continue to invest in growth, do the right thing for our team, the right thing for the guest, and utilize all of our assets to continue to build on the momentum that we have today and build market share across all of our key categories. Kelly, I'll start, and then I'll ask John to provide any additional comments. But we've certainly seen supply chain challenges going all the way to the start of the pandemic as demand across the U.S. continued to build. So we've done a terrific job. And I think our teams have shown great agility. They've adjusted to the marketplace to make sure that we've been able to meet the demand in our system. But we don't expect those supply chain challenges to go away as we go into the start of next year. And I think they'll dissipate over time. \n So we're doing our fair share to make sure that we're alleviating some of the congestion in the ports and making sure that we're unpacking containers and off-peak hours. We've utilized other ports across the country to try to relieve some of the congestion in L.A. Long Beach. But as John can attest, we know that we're going to still face some supply chain challenges as we go into 2022. There's still uncertainty as we think about supply from Asia as different factories from time to time are closed. And we're just going to have to show great flexibility and agility to provide the products that our guests are looking for and our system requires as we plan for the next fiscal year. I'll start. I think one of the positive surprises for us in Q3 was just the continued strength in traffic. To see our traffic grow by almost 13% was something that we actually didn't anticipate. We certainly were planning for a very strong quarter and continued market share gains. \n But to see the type of performance across our business, the strength of stores, comping up almost 10%, in a period when we were comping over a 9.9% growth rate in the prior year, to see our digital business grow by almost 30%, comping over 155% growth the year before, those numbers are actually stronger than we might have expected. To see the consistent growth across every one of our major merchandising categories, double-digit growth, just the way the guest was responding to our assortment, the value we were delivering, the great in-store experience, those were all really positive results in the quarter and actually exceeded our expectations when we were planning for Q3.\n Operator, we have time for 1 more question today. Robbie, why don't I start and let Christina add to my comments. But I think you've highlighted one of the real success stories within our business over the last few years. And the progress we've made from a Food & Beverage standpoint, the changes we've made in assortment, the market share gains that we've seen quarter after quarter now for multiple years, and the great response we're seeing to our own brands, and the strength and response we're seeing to Good & Gather is a real highlight for us. \n But as Christina can build in more detail, we're also seeing tremendous growth in our Beauty business, and ongoing strength in Household Essentials. And that's helping drive trips and leads to cross shopping across our multi-category portfolio. So the position we're in today in Food & Beverage is dramatically different from where we were 5 years ago. We're connecting with the guest. The quality, the assortment, the value we deliver is being really well received from the guest who shops our stores. And we're seeing accelerated growth with our Food & Beverage business from a digital standpoint. Robbie, thank you. And that, operator, concludes our third quarter conference call. We look forward to talking to all of you as we go into 2022. So thank you."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate what happens when our team lives out our purpose: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. When we lead with our guests first, we continue to build upon the trust that we have carefully earned with them over time. And when our strategies are guest-led, we grow our business, which supports our team, our financial performance and our ability to give back to our communities and the planet. \n As you heard from Brian, third quarter comparable sales grew 12.7%, reflecting double-digit growth in every one of our core merchandising categories. Even within those core categories, sales strength was broad-based, and virtually every area of the business grew over last year. This shows the power of our multi-category assortment in driving guest relevance and affinity for Target. \n While growth came from all categories, third quarter performance was led by our Essentials, Beauty and Food & Beverage categories, all of which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens. These businesses continue to deliver substantial share gains on top of last year's gains through both trip frequency and basket growth. \n In Essentials, growth was led by baby care, pets and over-the-counter health care categories. Strength in Food & Beverage was most notable in our fresh and frozen categories as well as in snacks and candy. Hardlines, which comped in the mid-teens on top of mid-30% comps last year, was fueled by incredible momentum in our toys and sporting goods businesses, which both saw comp growth north of 20%. Electronics delivered low single-digit comp growth on top of last year's comp of nearly 60%. \n In our Apparel business, comp sales grew in the low double-digits despite unseasonably warm weather across much of the country. Performance was strongest in swim, young contemporary, intimates and hosiery. In Home, low double-digit comp growth was led by seasonal and stationary categories, and reflected record-setting performance in the back-to-school, back-to-college and Halloween seasons. \n We have seen consistently strong results across seasonal categories, results that clearly signal that our guests are excited to celebrate the holidays with loved ones in new, old and reimagined ways. However they celebrate, our guests remain focused on meeting their wants and needs with ease, convenience and value. And as the holidays approach, they are turning to Target for these solutions. This is about more than just checking items off the list. Beyond working through the logistics of the holiday, our guests are looking to us to provide joy, and a joyous holiday is exactly what we plan to deliver. \n We continuously evaluate our guests' mindset, which serves as a North Star for all our strategies and decisions. We remain laser-focused on their experiences with us and expectations of us. And we strive to build flexibility and agility into our plans to ensure we show up at our best for them during the holidays and all year round. \n We are confident in our ability to navigate the broader retail landscape. And we're eager to share all that we've planned for the upcoming holidays. Whether our guests are rekindling old holiday traditions or finding new ways to celebrate the season, we're focused on making Target the destination that makes it easy, safe, inspiring and affordable to celebrate what matters most, the magic of spending time with those we love. \n As John will outline in more detail, our teams are working diligently to get the right inventory to the right place at the right time. Doing so has driven some near-term gross margin pressure, appropriate long-term investment in the relationship with our guests. Bottom line, based on the incredible efforts of our team, we feel good about our inventory levels heading into the holiday season. \n In addition to the investments in our inventory position, we remain committed to providing great value with every trip to Target. And that value goes far beyond delivering exceptional everyday pricing. It includes offering compelling holiday deals, great quality products and an array of options to support all budgets, including accessible payment options. \n Last year, we spread our promotions throughout the months of November and December to avoid crowding in stores, and we heard from our guests that they loved it. As a result, we're spreading savings throughout the season again this year to give guests flexibility to get the best deals on their terms whenever and however they choose to shop. We'll feature compelling offers throughout the season on top items, great weekly deals and surprise deals of the day, both in-store and online, as well as additional deals for Target Circle members. \n And to reinforce value throughout the season, we recently announced the launch of our Holiday Price Match Guarantee, our most robust price match ever. When guests see Holiday Best deals at Target, they can shop confidently, knowing they are getting Black Friday sized savings with our best planned price of the season. In essence, any time they see a deal at Target, our guests can be confident it's the right time to buy. \n We also know that our guests want flexibility, not just in what they want to buy and how they want to shop, but how to manage their budget as well. That's why with the help of 2 new partners, Sezzle and Affirm, we've added new payment solutions that allow our guests to buy what they need now, take advantage of our best deals and pay at a pace that works best for them.\n With a strong inventory position and a great value proposition, we're able to lean into our uniquely Target assortment to build upon our traditional offering great gifting ideas and easy gathering solutions, like even more creative Gingerbread House making kits, Bullseye's top toys and gift sets for any budget. Spanning beauty, apparel, food and beverage and more, these gifting options will bring together the best of only our Target-owned brands with curated national brands. And for those seeking extra inspiration, our thoughtfully curated digital shopping lists will bring the joyful discovery our guests love, helping them find the perfect gifts for anyone on their list, whether they are shopping our stores or on our site. \n In addition to gifting, guests are focused on gathering with friends and family. And we have everything they need to create memorable moments, whether it's preparing a delicious meal, throwing a festive family party or hosting a game night with friends. From Good & Gather cheeseboard starter kits and Favorite Day baked-goods, to Threshold fall collections, including festive baking dishes, serving platters in the color of the season, and an array of plates, linens and other table toppers, all $15 and under. We want to create joy for all of our guests this holiday season, and we are excited to do so with our most inclusive assortment to date. \n Throughout our digital and in-store shopping experience, our guests are sure to see themselves reflected in our culturally relevant gifting and gathering solutions. We'll highlight Black-owned businesses in Beauty, Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Home, including McBride Sisters wine pairings, Bipoc Author in our $10 book assortment and a limited time Black artist partnership in wrapping paper. And our guests will see themselves represented in inclusive gift card messaging and imagery, providing options that celebrate the many meaningful holidays of the season, including Kwanzaa and Hanukkah. \n We're also delivering joy beyond our holiday assortment by building on our incredible legacy of creating differentiated shop-in-shop experiences that drive traffic and inspire our guests. They continue to tell us how much they love our exciting and expanding partnerships, with brands like Disney, Ulta Beauty and Apple. \n With each partnership, we're adding excitement, convenience and newness for our guests, while unlocking incremental growth for each of the partners. So it's no surprise we're building on this momentum in time for the holiday season. We are tripling the number of Disney stores at Target locations and doubling our Apple shop-in-shop experiences. \n On top of that, of course, this will be our debut holiday season featuring Ulta Beauty at Target. And on the subject of Ulta Beauty at Target, our guests are telling us it's clearly hitting the bull's-eye, with makeup, skincare, bath and body, hair care and fragrance from more than 50 top brands now available at Ulta Beauty at Target. Both in stores and online, there's plenty to love about this new partnership, and we are so excited for all that is yet to come. \n And we'll build on our tradition of joy making partnerships this December when we will launch an exclusive lifestyle collection of products with one of the most beloved toy brands ever, Lego. Think brick-inspired hooded sweatshirts, colorful Lego-shaped tumblers and of course, iconic Lego brick and mini figure sets. This collection builds on our long-standing partnership with the Lego Group and reflects our shared values of inclusivity, optimism and joy. With nearly 300 must-haves for the family, pets and home, and most of the colorful brick inspired items under $30, our guests are sure to find something everyone will love on any budget. \n Joy, ease, value, inclusivity, the ingredients helping to deliver on our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life, a recipe that we refine quarter after quarter by listening to our guests, learning from their choices and working across our talented team. And these plans wouldn't come to life without the many talents and contributions of our dedicated team. \n So with deep gratitude and humility, I want to thank our team for serving the communities, for showing up every day for our guests and each other, and for bringing Target's values to life. You inspire me with all that you do. And because of you, I know we will win this holiday season. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. I was just going to add a little bit of commentary to Brian's point about how Food & Beverage fits into the broad portfolio. The multi-category portfolio and the strength across the entirety is part of Target's sweet spot. So Food & Beverage is certainly an incredible proof point that's grown and driven share acceleration and traffic, but we rely on all of our categories to play that role at different times of year. And it's that combination that makes it so compelling whether it's back-to-school whether it's Halloween, whether it's Memorial Day or whether it's just your everyday trip when you need to pick up milk and bread. So this is part of the strategy that's accelerating the relevance for the consumer across the board."

            "content": "Thanks, John. Over time, we've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business, ones that will deepen Target's relationship with our guests, driving engagement, which ultimately leads them to shop at Target more often. And while it's our job to focus on driving performance every day, we've committed to making investment decisions with a long-term perspective, not limiting our horizon to a month, a season, a quarter or even a year, but thinking about how to position Target as a leading retailer for generations. \n That's how I think about our third quarter. In the face of multiple challenges in the external environment, we maintained our focus on our guests and took specific actions to ensure we have a healthy inventory position going into the holidays, even though those actions involve some incremental cost. And importantly, as we face those decisions, we had the resources we needed, including the best team in retail, a sophisticated global supply chain and a durable model that could accommodate those guest-focused investments. \n And while we're making these decisions with a focus on the long term, we've already seen the benefit of this year's inventory investments, given that they helped to power third quarter traffic and sales growth that exceeded our expectations. In addition, given strong expense discipline across the organization, we benefited from a compelling amount of leverage on our SG&A and D&A expenses, resulting in solid EPS growth despite the sizable investments we were choosing to make. \n As Brian mentioned, our 12.7% comp in the third quarter came on top of a nearly 21% increase a year ago. As expected, within the quarter, we saw a shift in a portion of our back-to-school sales back into August, given that most schools across the country began the school year with in-person learning. As a result, our August comp was our strongest of the quarter, our September comp dipped down to about 10%, and we accelerated back into the low teens in October. \n Among the component drivers of our sales, growth continues to be driven by traffic, even as we retain nearly all of the basket growth that happened a year ago. Specifically, third quarter traffic increased 12.9% on top of a 4.5% increase last year, while average ticket declined only slightly, about 20 basis points, after growing more than 15% a year ago. Among our sales channels, stores comparable sales grew 9.7% in the quarter, on top of 9.9% last year, while digital comp sales grew 29%, on top of 155% growth a year ago. \n Within our digital fulfillment, sales on orders shipped to home increased slightly over last year, while same-day services grew about 60%, on top of a more than 200% increase a year ago. Among those same-day options, both in-store Pickup and Shipt grew more than 30% in the quarter, while Drive Up grew more than 80%, on top of more than 500% a year ago. Put another way, since 2019, sales through Drive Up have expanded more than 10x or about $1.4 billion in the third quarter alone. \n Moving down the P&L. Our third quarter gross margin rate of 28% was 2.6 percentage points lower than a year ago. Among the drivers, core merchandising accounted for 2 percentage points or more than 3/4 of the rate decline, driven primarily by incremental freight and other inventory costs. Among the other gross margin drivers, payroll growth in our supply chain accounted for about 70 basis points of pressure, while category sales mix contributed about 10 basis points of benefit. \n Notably, digital fulfillment had an approximately neutral impact on gross margin rate in the quarter, as the costs associated with higher digital volume were offset by the benefit of a shift in fulfillment mix towards our same-day options, which have meaningfully lower average unit costs compared with traditional e-commerce. \n On the SG&A expense line, we saw about 160 basis points of improvement in the third quarter, reflecting disciplined cost management, combined with the leverage benefit of unexpectedly strong sales. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement, as sales growth more than offset the impact of higher accelerated depreciation, which reflects the continued ramp-up in our remodel program. \n Altogether, our third quarter operating margin rate of 7.8% was about 70 basis points lower than a year ago, but more than 2 percentage points higher than 2 years ago. On a dollar basis, operating income was 3.9% higher than a year ago and double the number recorded in the third quarter of 2019. \n Moving to the bottom of the P&L. Our third quarter GAAP EPS of $3.04 was 52% higher than last year when we recorded more than $500 million of interest expense on early debt retirement. On the adjusted EPS line, where we excluded early debt retirement expense, we earned $3.03 in the quarter, representing an 8.7% increase from a year ago. Compared with 2 years ago, both GAAP and adjusted EPS have increased more than 120%. \n Turning now to capital deployment. I'm going to start, as always, with our long-term priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we support the dividend and look to build on our long history of annual increases, which we maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we're returning the excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time. \n On the CapEx line, we'd invested $2.5 billion through the first 3 quarters of 2021 and expect to reach about $3.3 billion for the full year. As I mentioned last quarter, this is somewhat lower than our expectation going into the year and reflects the retiming of project spending into next year, given that we've experienced delays on some projects relating to external factors like permitting and inspections in some communities. \n However, as John mentioned earlier, we're eager to invest in a long list of productive growth opportunities over the next few years: adding new stores, remodeling existing stores, building replenishment capacity in our supply chain, and rolling out additional sortation centers. As of today, we continue to believe these investments will amount to CapEx in the $4 billion to $5 billion range in 2022, and we'll continue to refine our view in the months ahead. \n Turning now to dividends. We paid $440 million in dividends in the third quarter, up $100 million from last year. This increase reflects a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. I want to pause here and take note of the fact that, with the payment of our December dividend, we'll officially achieve our 50th consecutive year of annual increases in the per share dividend, something very few companies have achieved. \n And lastly, given our cash position and strong cash generation by our operations, we continue to have ample capacity for share repurchases within the limits of our middle A ratings, even after we've made robust investments in CapEx and dividends. In the third quarter, we deployed $2.2 billion to repurchase 8.8 million of our shares, bringing our year-to-date total up to $4.9 billion. \n As I've mentioned in prior quarters, given our continued strong financial performance, our debt leverage has been lower and cash on the balance sheet has been higher than we'd expect to maintain over the longer term. As a result, going forward, we expect to increase our leverage and reduce our cash position at a pace that's consistent with our financial expectations, credit rating goals and assessment of the external environment. \n I've mentioned before that the time line to move those metrics fully back to historical levels will likely be a multiyear journey. And the rapidly changing conditions we've seen over the last 2 years demonstrate why it's prudent to maintain a thoughtful pace. \n As always, I'll end my review of performance with our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the quality of our current performance in the context of the investments we've made over time. For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q3, our business generated an after-tax ROIC of 31.3% compared with 19.9% a year ago. This is incredibly robust performance and demonstrates why we are enthusiastically planning to continue investing in our business. \n Now let me turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. 90 days ago, we said we were planning for high single-digit growth in our comparable sales over the back half of the year. While we still believe that's in the range of possible outcomes for the fourth quarter, we just exceeded that expectation in Q3. As such, we're planning for a Q4 comp in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, consistent with the range we've seen over the last 2 quarters. \n In terms of profitability, we continue to expect that our business will deliver a full year operating margin rate of 8% or higher, up significantly from 7% in 2020. This rate favorability, combined with the full year sales growth we're positioned to deliver, would translate into another incredibly strong year of profit growth, following a record year in 2020. \n So now as I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to pause and address a question that I'm certain you'll be asking, which is, how much of the current cost pressures will turn out to be temporary and how much will turn out to be structural? And I'll give you the honest answer, which is that it's almost certainly some of both. And no one knows the precise answer. \n That said, there's no doubt that supply chain bottlenecks should ease over time. However, beyond the supply chain, we're also facing product cost increases from some vendors, driven by higher costs in their businesses. And while you heard from John that we're extremely well positioned given our team investments over the last few years, the labor market remains very tight across the country. \n So how do we think about the future? From a financial standpoint, we focus first on serving our guests and translating that focus into further growth, an area where we see a lot of runway. As you've seen with the investments we've made and continue to make, we're earning deeper trust and engagement from our guests. This trust leads to more trips and broader shopping across our merchandise assortment and fulfillment services. \n With a skilled and agile team focused on driving guest engagement, further growth and market share gains, we're confident that our durable model can continue to offer compelling value for our guests, accommodate continued investments in our team and deliver outstanding financial performance, even in the face of a challenging external environment like we're facing today. This is one more example of the power of 'and'. \n So now I want to pause and thank our entire team for delivering a great Q3, which came on top of years of already strong performance. The financial results I have the privilege of sharing quarter after quarter wouldn't be possible if Target didn't have the best team in retail. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks for the question, Michael. As you know, we don't guide margins specifically out into future quarters. But I will say and reiterate what I said in my remarks. I think you're seeing in the third quarter, the result of some very specific investments we made. And the biggest of those investments is an investment to make sure we've got a great inventory position heading into the fourth quarter. And pulling all the levers within the system to ensure we're there for the guest has been our priority. And some of those levers, think of expediting product to come at a cost, and you saw some of that in the third quarter. \n But I feel really good about the payoff from an investment decision like that. We've got inventory of $2 billion north of last year, up almost 20% on a year-over-year basis. And that's fueling the continued top line growth that we see. So I feel really good about the set of investments that we're making and how they have us positioned for the back part of the year. Yes. On the SG&A side, I think the theme you see in Q3 is just an example of how powerful productivity improvements that come with growth are for our business. We generate astounding leverage when the top line is running forcibly in the right direction, and it certainly was in the third quarter. That's one of the reasons. We want to make sure we're so well positioned to support continued growth because the P&L works great when we're generating that SG&A leverage, just like you saw in Q3. Yes. Chris, we -- you're thinking about it conceptually, I'd say, in the right way, in that the third quarter and fourth quarter kind of straddle the big inventory build and relief that happens for us in advance of the holiday season every year. And so those will be the factors at play, while I won't begin to get into the specifics of that level of gross margin for what that means in Q4. But I just zoom out and I feel really good about our ability to manage all of the levers and to see EPS growth of almost 9% in the third quarter, and yes, some investment in gross margin, but also a ton of leverage on the SG&A line. And we feel really good about how that positions us for the fourth quarter and the investments in inventory. And importantly, the investments in value for our guests, I think, will be investments that continue to pay off. Well, thanks for the question, Karen. It's -- I guess I'd start by saying it's wrapped into the guidance we've given for the balance of the year. We would expect op income rate of 8% or higher. And that's inclusive of a lot of moving pieces and puts and takes throughout the P&L. But I'll tell you the place that starts is growth, and that's why high single-digit to low double-digit expectations for the fourth quarter are kind of where the short-term algorithm starts. And with that kind of growth, we feel confident in our ability to put together a P&L that works. \n The time will be right in the future to unpack the future year algorithm. But I will say, over time, we expect to be a growth company. We expect to be a company that's growing the top line and gaining share over time. And that's where that algorithm will start. Yes. I describe us as still chasing. The strength in the top line means that we're still not seeing those clearance markdowns return in force, like you've heard me talk about quarter-over-quarter. And so that said, we feel really good about how inventory is positioned for the fourth quarter. And so that $2 billion higher than last year, up almost 20%, it means we'll be ready to serve our guests for the important holiday season."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 18, 2021.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our second quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the third quarter and beyond. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.\n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the first quarter and his perspective on our outlook. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance showed that Target's leadership position is stronger than it's ever been, fueled by a one-of-a-kind strategy, resilient operations and a passionate, world-class team. \n As you know, we've been investing for years to build the durable model that's in place today, one that puts our guests first and leverages all of our assets and capabilities to serve their evolving wants and needs. After years of investment and effort in building this model, it's clear that we've only begun to scratch the surface of what's possible over time.\n In the second quarter, our business continued to perform and grow on both the top and bottom lines, even as we comped over record performance a year ago. Of course, seeing growth on top of growth is nothing new. Our business is already delivering consistent increases in sales and profitability in the years leading up to the pandemic. This was followed by a dramatic acceleration in 2020 and this year's continued growth.\n In the second quarter, Target's comparable sales increased 8.9% on top of a record 24.3% growth a year ago. As a result, second quarter total sales have expanded more than 36% or more than $6.6 billion over the last 2 years.\n On the bottom line, we earned second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.64, up nearly 8% compared with last year and double our performance 2 years ago.\n As we described last quarter, guests have emerged from a year in which digital was the primary growth driver, and they're now returning to our stores in droves. As a result, the majority of our second quarter growth was driven by the stores channel, where comps grew 8.7% on top of 10.9% a year ago. In addition, traffic accounted for more than 100% of our second quarter growth, in contrast to a year ago when guests were limiting time out of their homes and the bulk of our growth was coming from bigger transactions.\n Comparable digital sales grew 10% in the second quarter, building on the record growth of 195% last year. The digital channel continues to be led by our same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, which together grew 55% this year on top of more than 270% last year. Given their rapid expansion, same-day services now account for well over half of our digital sales. \n Among those same-day options, Drive Up has quickly grown to be the largest, accounting for more sales than pickup and Shipt combined. To put it in dollar terms, over the last 2 years, second quarter sales through Drive Up alone have increased by nearly $1.4 billion. And for the spring season, they've expanded by double that amount. \n Beyond our fulfillment options, we continue to benefit from our unique multi-category assortment, which is perfectly positioned to serve our guests' evolving wants and needs. As a result, comp sales in all 5 of our core categories expanded in the second quarter on top of strong growth a year ago. As expected, apparel continued to lead the way as our guests continue to respond to newness and style across both our owned and national brands throughout the assortment. \n Also as expected, we saw more moderate growth in our Hardlines and home categories this year as they expanded on top of really strong comparisons from a year ago. And notably, we continue to benefit from impressive performance across our less discretionary Food & Beverage and essential categories. These categories have again consistently delivered strong growth and market share gains, both in 2020 and again this year. I'll let Christina provide more details in a few minutes.\n When we talk with many of you about what's driving Target performance, we often hear the question, \"What's the one thing that's been the key?\" The honest answer to that question, we can't point to any one thing. Rather, it's been everything working together that's driven our performance. This includes our supply chain work, which has positioned our stores as fulfillment hubs, while transforming the way we replenish store inventory. Then there's our rollout of same-day services, which began more than 5 years ago with in-store pickup, followed by the nationwide rollout of Drive Up and Shipt beginning in 2018. \n And there's the refreshment of our own brands, which began in 2016 with the rollout of Cat & Jack, followed by dozens of new owned brands over the last 5 years. At the same time, we've expanded our partnerships with premium national brands, including Disney, Levi's and Apple and, most recently, this month's opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop in shops. Across our store portfolio, we began testing small formats in 2014. And we now have more than 140 of these productive neighborhood locations across the country.\n We've also remodeled more than half the chain over the last 4 years, transforming the shopping environment while optimizing the layout in support of our same-day services. And we've reinvented our store operating model, focusing on enhanced service and subject matter expertise in key categories while investing in visual merchandising across our network.\n Then there's Target Circle, which launched in 2019 and now has more than 100 million members, providing a new connection with our guests while offering meaningful rewards.\n And of course, we made multiple investments in our team, including the attainment of our goal to bring Target's nationwide starting wage up to $15 or more. This was certainly an important milestone, but far from the end of the journey. Just a few weeks ago, we announced an investment of more than $75 million to provide $200 recognition bonuses to all of our frontline, hourly, full-time and part-time team members across our stores, distribution centers and contact centers. \n I've said it many times before, but I can't say it enough. Our team is the lifeblood of Target. And our success begins and ends with them. I want to thank each of them and every one of them across the world for everything they do to make Target such a special place to shop and a great place to work and build a rewarding career. And today, given the profitable growth that comes from all of these efforts, we can continue to invest in making our business even stronger and more durable over time. \n In June, we were incredibly excited to launch Target Forward, an ambitious new sustainability strategy grounded in the vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future with our guests, partners and communities. Target Forward is centered around 3 critical ambitions: to design and elevate sustainable brands, innovate to eliminate waste and accelerate opportunity and equity. This bold initiative is the beginning of the new chapter for how we'll define sustainability, position our business for long-term growth and resiliency and build on our rich legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices.\n As part of these efforts, in early August we announced that this fall, Target will be rolling out an industry-leading program to provide debt-free educational assistance for all of our U.S.-based full-time and part-time team members. This program will provide access to more than 250 business-aligned programs at more than 40 educational institutions, including historical black colleges and universities, along with institutions serving the Hispanic community. In total, we plan to spend $200 million to offer this benefit over the next 4 years, serving as a meaningful example of how we're investing to promote opportunity and equity in our communities, beginning with our own team. \n So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to acknowledge the likelihood that the second half of the year will continue to be volatile, particularly in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant. Of course, safety remains our #1 priority, as evident in the way we operate our stores and our ongoing investments to encourage vaccinations by making them easy and accessible for both our team and our guests.\n In terms of our business, the last 18 months have proven, beyond a doubt, the flexibility and resilience of both our team and our business model. And while sales in stores have been soaring so far this year, our operations and team have demonstrated how they can pivot seamlessly between stores and digital commerce based on how our guests choose to shop. I also want to emphasize that as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we see many more productive opportunities to invest in continued growth. \n And I also want to acknowledge the continued high level of execution we've been seeing across all of our teams. As John will outline in more detail, despite unusually high volatility for well over a year now, the Target team has been consistently setting the industry standard in terms of execution despite multiple challenges in the external environment. \n Our team continues to embrace every challenge as one aligned Target team, taking care of each other as they focus on serving our guests. I am truly inspired by their work and grateful to share the outstanding performance they're delivering quarter after quarter, year after year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our guests is at the forefront of every decision we make. By listening intently to them, anticipating their wants and needs and building our strategy around them, we can drive deeper engagement, trust and a stronger preference for Target over time. \n We built our same-day capabilities with that guest-first focus. And as we've shared before, when guests try services like Drive Up or Shipt for the first time, their overall spending increases, including an increase in conventional store shopping. In other words, digital engagement drives more engagement in our stores, providing us with more and more opportunities to surprise, delight and inspire them. This is one example of many showing how growth today creates a platform for additional growth in the future.\n And of course, we wouldn't be where we are today without the best team in retail. So I want to take a moment and thank our entire team for delivering superior performance in a continued volatile environment even as they face ongoing challenges presented by the Delta variant, product cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and more.\n Target's second quarter performance also demonstrates the strength and durability of our business model. Our unique, multi-category assortment offers the right balance of what our guests want and need even as they change, sometimes rapidly. As a result, despite record-setting growth last year, all 5 of our core merchandising categories grew again this year, proving that there's still plenty of runway ahead.\n Second quarter results were strongest in apparel, which delivered mid-teens growth on top of low double-digit growth last year. Within apparel, swim, kids and young contemporary all delivered comps in the low 20% range. \n Food & Beverage delivered low double-digit growth in the second quarter. Performance was led by our bakery, cafe and deli businesses, which grew more than 50% as these departments were closed during part of the second quarter last year. We also saw double-digit growth in our fresh categories, benefiting from an expansion in the number of items available for Drive Up. In fact, nearly half of this year's growth in our produce business has been driven by the growth in Drive Up orders.\n The Essentials & Beauty category delivered high single-digit growth this quarter. Within essentials, baby care grew by more than 20%, and we saw mid to high teens growth in both pets and health care. Beauty continued to gain market share on comp growth in the high single-digit range in advance of this month's rollout of our in-store partnership with Ulta Beauty.\n Hardlines delivered mid-single-digit growth this quarter on top of more than 40% growth a year ago. We continue to benefit from strong momentum in toys, which grew in the low 20% range. Sporting goods was also a standout with growth in the high teens. As expected, electronics experienced a moderate comp decline in the mid-single-digit range as it comped over last year's growth of more than 70% during a period when some competitors were closed. Importantly, over the last 2 years, both Hardlines and electronics have delivered strong growth and market share gains. \n And finally, in home, following comp growth of more than 30% last year, we saw a low single-digit increase in the second quarter. Within home, we've seen moderating trends in categories like kitchen, storage and decor as they comped over outsized growth last year. At the same time, given our guests' increasing focus on gathering and celebrating holidays and family milestones, we've seen an acceleration in our seasonal and stationary categories, providing another example of the power of our broad, multi-category model.\n And beyond individual categories, our diverse collection of owned brands continues to grow and provide differentiation across our assortment. In the second quarter, owned brand sales outpaced the company with growth in the mid-teens. And in Food & Beverage, where we're seeing tremendous growth in Good & Gather and encouraging results in our new brand, Favorite Day, we saw an increase in owned brand penetration of about 70 basis points compared with last year.\n As we look ahead, despite uncertainties around the Delta variant and rising COVID cases, consumers have healthy balance sheets and remain eager to find safe ways to connect with their loved ones and find some sense of normalcy. We'll continue to safely meet their needs and add some much needed joy. \n First on that list is this month's launch of Ulta Beauty at Target, the next chapter in Target's already strong beauty story. The shared values and cultures between our businesses and our collective desire to inspire and elevate the shopping experience make this long-term partnership a major win for both companies and our guests. And like our guests, we're incredibly excited to see this new concept come to life following months of anticipation.\n But our guests aren't just excited for their glow up to their beauty game, they're also looking for affordable options to refresh their wardrobe as they cautiously plan for more in-person interactions this fall. So it's perfect timing that this September, Target is partnering with 4 dynamic and highly regarded designers, Nili Lotan, Rachel Comey, Sandy Liang and Victor Glemaud, to create a limited time, size-inclusive apparel collection of modern and classic wardrobe staples.\n And our partnerships go well beyond apparel and beauty. In home, we've enlisted the talent of Justina Blakeney, Jungalow founder and long-time partner, to bring Junglalow's cozy, wild and free vibe into our Opalhouse line, making it the perfect addition to our eclectic owned brand.\n And for our littler guests, our newest design partnership is sure to inspire their imagination and help them to create some great new looks. Christian Robinson for Target, a full-of-wonder creation of the beloved artist, illustrator and children's book author, is a limited edition collection that includes home goods, apparel and books for kids and baby. And last, not least, for the furrier family members in your household, we have just launched Kindfull, our new pet food-owned brand focusing on healthy, sustainable and affordable food options for our beloved 4-legged friends.\n Beyond partnerships and product launches, our guests are telling us they're hungry to celebrate key holidays, life moments and everyday occasions with their loved ones, having missed out on so many of them over the last 18 months. So even as they're mindful of the ongoing risks, our guests are carefully balancing caution with optimism and focusing on finding safe and affordable ways to celebrate. \n Already in progress, the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons are off to a great start. Regardless of whether back-to-school will be in-person or hybrid, Target has everything they need to be successful in any learning environment.\n Similarly, as college freshmen look to move on to campus for the first time, our merchandising and inventory plans account for the fact that many sophomores find themselves in that same position, having attended their first year of college in a completely virtual environment.\n Given the stresses that come with the start of school, Target is focused on making things as easy as possible for families with School List Assist. This feature, online and in the Target app, allows users to easily find their school-specific supply list and either shop by item or add the whole list with a click of a button. \n And like we did for holiday last year, our back-to-school offers will be spread throughout the entire season, providing both value and a safe shopping experience for our guests. This reflects our ongoing focus on providing value that goes far beyond price. It's about affordability and accessibility all season long.\n And on that topic of providing value, we're rolling out new functionality in the Target app based on hearing from our guests that the fear of missing out on a deal is real, something affectionately known as promo FOMO. With this update, when guests add items to their cart, the app will automatically show them all the applicable Target Circle offers before checking out, reassuring them that they won't miss out on a great deal.\n Looking ahead, we'll soon be trading in shorts and t-shirts for cozy sweaters and denim as we usher in the fall. And for Halloween, no matter how you plan to celebrate, Target has a few tricks and no shortage of treats up our sleeves. We'll continue to focus on value and inspiration with affordable and exciting costumes, including a broader-than-ever array of adaptive, size-inclusive and gender-neutral options. And of course, we'll have all the sweet treats for self-indulgence and sharing with others, including great new offerings from our Hyde & EEK! and Favorite Day owned brands.\n Beyond our near-term plans, what energizes me the most is our focus on creating a more equitable, sustainable and inclusive world. This is why I'm so proud of our recently announced sustainability strategy, Target Forward, which is a comprehensive vision that touches every aspect of our business in support of people and planet. \n You've heard me talk about my role on Target's REACH Committee, which was formed with a goal of achieving lasting, systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities, serving as a perfect extension of the broader Target Forward strategy. The recruitment and retention of more diverse team members, more products from diverse suppliers, a new direction for our philanthropic efforts in communities of color and more equity for all, these are unwavering commitments in support of our goals. \n While there's much more to accomplish, I'm pleased with the progress we've already made. One example is our commitment to increase black representation across our company by 20% by the year 2023. To date, we've seen progress at all salaried levels, most notably in a nearly 25% increase among our company officers. \n So while it's incredibly rewarding to see how well our business is performing, I'm most proud of our commitment to invest in the long-term health of our team, our communities and the planet, our company purpose, focus on sustainability and then creating a more equitable and inclusive world. These are not a collection of separate initiatives tacked onto our core business. Rather, they are the bedrock of who we are and how we make decisions. While their benefit may be hard to quantify in a spreadsheet, I strongly believe that they're the foundation of how we'll grow our business, sustain our communities and move forward together over time.\n With that, I will turn the call over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. As I've mentioned before, I'm an engineer by training. So it probably comes as no surprise that I'm naturally interested in machines and automation. And obviously, when our team works to optimize Target's operations, both for today and in the future, we have access to every available tool and technology, robotics, automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. But when we choose to invest in technology, we're not looking to remove the human element from the Target experience. Instead, we're investing to enhance the productivity of our team members, freeing them up to focus on what's most important, like serving our guests.\n This is another example of the power of and how it runs through every part of our business. The choice doesn't have to be about people or technology. We can invest in both people and their productivity. \n Here's one way to think about it. In our 2015 annual report, we reported that Target had around 341,000 team members as we entered 2016, a year in which our business generated just over $69 billion in sales. 5 years later, our 2020 annual report showed that we had about 409,000 team members going into this year, representing about 20% growth in the number of team members over that 5-year period. \n However, based on our results so far and our expectations for the back half of the year, our business is positioned to deliver more than $100 billion in sales this year, representing growth of 45% or more compared with 5 years ago. So even as we've added nearly 70,000 people to our team, we've also benefited from a significant increase in their productivity, creating financial capacity to provide enhanced service for our guests and make significant investments in pay and benefits. \n And as Brian mentioned, our team has been performing at an incredibly high level, raising the bar on historically strong execution. Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw an improvement in already high Net Promoter Scores for all 3 of our same-day services, most notably for the in-store pickup experience. In addition, Drive Up, which remains our highest-rated service, saw an increase in guest satisfaction compared with last year, on top of last year's improvements over 2019.\n And we continue to find ways to enhance our industry-leading pickup and Drive Up capabilities. In the second quarter, we added another 5,000 items to the assortment available for pickup and Drive Up, ranging from items in adult beverages to fresh pet food, meal kits and greeting cards. We also continue to roll out technology enhancements, including functionality to provide backup suggestions when an item is unavailable, a chain-wide rollout of numbered parking spaces for guests using Drive Up and the ability in the app to seamlessly designate an alternate person to pick up an order.\n Beyond same-day capabilities, we also saw a meaningful increase in satisfaction with our in-store shopping experience, driven by improvements across multiple attributes, most notably around team member interactions, both on the sales floor and at checkout. These increases reflect the impact of our new service initiatives, which focus on serving our guests on their own terms, while authentically bringing our company purpose to life through the guest experience.\n This spring, more than 300,000 team members completed training on these initiatives, offering them tools to provide a consistent, differentiated shopping experience regardless of how our guests choose to shop. Higher guest satisfaction scores provide clear evidence that our team has enthusiastically embraced this training as they build their confidence and expertise in establishing authentic connections with our guests.\n As Christina mentioned, our teams at headquarters have also done a great job as they navigate multiple challenges across the supply chain. And while we're happy that in-stocks have improved meaningfully compared with a year ago, we have more work to do as our guests are still seeing empty shelves on some occasions. In some of those situations, we've simply sold beyond our expectations, and our team is working quickly to secure additional quantities. In other cases, the vendors themselves are facing constraints in their ability to deliver product. And we're collaborating with them to address these constraints together, securing as much product as possible on behalf of our guests.\n And our team has been successfully addressing supply chain bottlenecks, which are affecting both domestic freight and international shipping. Steps include expedited ordering and larger upfront quantities in advance of a season, mitigating the risk that replenishment could take longer than usual. Bottom line, with Q2 ending inventory up more than 26% or nearly $2.5 billion compared with a year ago, we believe we're well positioned for the fall and ready to deliver strong growth on top of last year's record increases.\n In everyday life, when you see an artist, performer or athlete who's at the top of their craft, they typically make their work look simple. The mastery they've achieved makes it easy to look past all the effort and passion behind their high level of performance. That's true in business as well. When you see a successful company generating impressive growth on both the top line and the bottom line, it's easy to miss the passion and hard work of the team that's delivering that performance. So as always, I want to pause and thank our team members everywhere in the world for everything they do to propel our business forward regardless of the challenges that come their way.\n Our properties team has had a busy year as they ramp up our remodel program following last year's temporary suspension. In addition, they're working to open new neighborhood stores, distribution centers and sortation centers across the country. More than 100 remodel projects are currently in flight, and we're on track to complete about 140 remodels in 2021 and an even higher number in 2022. \n The team has also opened 19 new stores this year, spanning from 3 more stores in New York City to all the way across the country in Hollywood. We're on track to open 12 more stores this fall, including a new location in Orlando adjacent to Disney World, a new site in Hawaii and a campus location in Madison, Wisconsin, welcome news to all my fellow Badgers out there.\n We opened 2 new distribution facilities in the second quarter: 1 in New Jersey and another near Chicago, creating additional replenishment capacity within our network. We're planning to add more capacity in 2022, given the sales growth we've already sustained over the last 1.5 years and the continued growth we expect to generate going forward.\n And to support our ship-from-store capability, the team is getting ready to open 2 new sortation centers in October, followed by 2 more after the holidays. These new facilities offer faster delivery times at a lower cost in markets with a high density of shipments. In addition, they free up backroom space at store locations they serve, expanding capacity for more digital growth over time.\n And finally, in support of our commitment to being a net 0 enterprise by 2040, the team is driving towards 0 waste to landfill in our U.S. operations and improving overall energy efficiency as we transition to renewable energy. This includes investing in contracts for off-site renewable energy and additional rooftop solar projects as we move beyond our 2020 goal of having rooftop solar at 500 facilities.\n So it's clear we have many opportunities to invest capital productively across both our stores and the broader supply chain. But I want to end my remarks where I started: with our team. I've been at Target for 25 years now, and one of the many reasons I've stayed here is the way we've always invested in our team, creating a uniquely strong culture and a high level of engagement. \n But in recent years, we've doubled down on what was already a strength. Obviously, this includes our investments in pay, including our starting wage, but it goes much further. We've also made investments in benefits and recently announced that several programs we added during the pandemic have now become ongoing benefits for all U.S.-based team members, including free access to health care through virtual doctor visits and free online resources and apps to support mental, emotional and physical health.\n And as Brian mentioned, in support of Target Forward's ambitions to advance opportunity and equity and create an equitable and inclusive workforce, we are really proud and excited to announce our new debt-free education assistance program earlier this month. We have the most comprehensive program in the industry, offering more than 340,000 team members debt-free access to undergraduate degrees, certificates, certifications and more, beginning with their first day at Target. Importantly, the program pays for smaller out-of-pocket costs, such as textbooks and course fees that might otherwise hinder participation. And for those who want to continue beyond their undergraduate education, the program will pay up to $10,000 annually for team members pursuing a master's degree. \n As Brian has said many times, of all the investments we've made over the last 5 years, none have been more impactful than the ones we've made in our team. And like any investment that's generating a high return, we continue to look for opportunities to do more, deepening our team's connection with Target, while they deepen Target's relationship with our guests.\n Because of the investments we've made over time, store team member turnover remains low at a time when the labor market has been heating up to levels we haven't seen in a very long time. That's one of the many reasons I'm grateful to serve alongside this great team, and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. After a record year in 2020, the theme of this year's performance has been growth on top of growth. Of course, we laid the groundwork for this year's growth through the investment decisions we were making years ago in our stores, owned brands, supply chain, technology and our team. And today, we continue to see a host of opportunities to invest in our future. That certainly includes the capital we're investing in support of our stores and supply chain and the investments we're making in our team, including recently announced team member bonuses and our new debt-free education assistance program. And while the return on team member investments isn't measured as a distinct line in our financial statements, they're the most important investments we make. \n Total sales grew 9.4% in the second quarter, driven by comp growth of 8.9%. Within the quarter, May saw the smallest increase this year, given that it was comping over a 33% increase a year ago. On a 2-year basis, results were much more consistent throughout the quarter, as we saw 2-year growth in excess of 30% across all 3 months. \n As Brian mentioned, with guests spending more time out of their homes, we've seen them shopping more often and making slightly smaller trips. Specifically, traffic grew 12.7% in the second quarter, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in average ticket. However, given that last year's comp growth was primarily driven by average ticket, on a 2-year basis, we've seen double-digit increases in both traffic and ticket since 2019.\n As Brian also mentioned, the store channel has been our primary growth driver this year. Specifically, store comparable sales grew 8.7% in the second quarter. And given that store comps increased 10.9% last year, we've seen compounded growth of our in-store sales of more than 20% over the last 2 years.\n In the digital channel, comp sales grew 10% on top of 195% a year ago. And reflecting this year's change in guests' shopping habits, the mix of our digital fulfillment changed meaningfully. Specifically, same-day services grew 55% in the quarter, while sales on orders shipped to home actually declined from last year's elevated levels. This provides vivid evidence of the stickiness of our same-day services. Once guests try them, they love them. So even as they've ramped up their in-store shopping, they've continued to rely on these services as well.\n Another indication of this year's shift in guest behavior, the percent of total sales from the digital channel actually fell slightly compared with last year, moving from 17.2% in second quarter 2020 back to 17% this year. Obviously, this isn't a trend we expect will continue over time, and it's important to note that this year's digital penetration of 17% is well over double the 7.3% we reported in second quarter 2019. \n Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was down about 50 basis points from 30.9% a year ago. Among the drivers, last year's change in the sales return reserve estimate, which contributed about $110 million to second quarter gross margin last year, accounted for about 50 basis points of rate pressure this year. In other words, without last year's benefit from this change in the reserve estimate, our second quarter gross margin rate would have been about flat compared to last year. \n Among other gross margin drivers, we saw about 70 basis points of pressure in merchandising, reflecting the impact of higher product and freight costs, partially offset by the benefit of low markdown rates. This pressure was offset by about 40 basis points of tailwind for merchandise mix, combined with a small benefit from supply chain and digital fulfillment, driven by the shift in digital mix toward our less costly same-day options. \n On the SG&A expense line, we saw a rate of 19.3% this year, down about 10 basis points from last year. This change reflected the continued leverage benefit from strong sales growth, offset by pressure from an increase in some expense rates in areas like marketing from lower-than-normal levels a year ago. This year's SG&A expenses also reflect continued growth in pay and benefits for our team. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from last year, driven by leverage on our sales growth. \n Altogether, second quarter operating margin rate was 9.8%, down about 20 basis points from a year ago, but more than 2.5 percentage points higher than second quarter 2019. On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP EPS of $3.65 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and adjusted EPS of $3.64 was 7.9% above last year. Second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS have both doubled over the last 2 years.\n So far this year, our operations have generated just over $3.4 billion of cash. This is historically strong performance, but about $1.7 billion lower than a year ago due to some unique circumstances affecting last year. Specifically, our inventory position at the end of the second quarter last year was much lower than we'd have preferred given that our sales had far outpaced our expectations during the first half of the year. As a result, at this point last year, inventory turnover and payables leverage were running unusually high and would have been lower had we owned the appropriate amount of inventory to support our sales. \n As such, this year, our inventory is in a much better position, more than $2 billion higher than last year. And our payables leverage has begun to decline to a more sustainable level, both of which are near-term headwinds to operating cash flow. In addition, our year-to-date income tax payments are more than $1 billion higher than at this time last year, given the volatility in our taxable income through the first half of last year.\n As I turn to capital deployment, I want to start where I always do, which is to reiterate our priorities, which have remained the same for decades. First, we invest fully in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual dividend increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we return any excess cash over time through share repurchases within the limits of our strong middle A credit ratings.\n So far this year, we've invested just over $1.3 billion in CapEx to support the new store, remodel and supply chain projects that John outlined earlier. And for the year, we're now expecting CapEx in the $3.5 billion range. This is about $0.5 billion lower than our original expectation and reflects the retiming of some project spending into next year. As a result of this retiming, our view of next year's CapEx is somewhat higher than our prior view, in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. And we'll continue to refine our view as we move into next year. Bottom line, we're excited about the productive opportunities in front of us and we'll govern our investment decisions with a focus on delivering continued growth and superior returns. \n Beyond our capital investments, we paid dividends of $336 million in the second quarter, and we returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases at an average price of just over $230. And as we announced today, our Board has approved a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which will allow us to continue buying back shares once the current $5 billion program is completed. This authorization is consistent with the capital deployment priorities I outlined above. It also reflects our confidence in the ongoing strength of our business and the robust cash flow we expect to generate over time. \n Even after this year's investments in our business and team and the return of capital to our shareholders, we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $7.4 billion. This is up slightly from a year ago and well above the cash position we expect to maintain over time. But as I've said before, given our current cash position and elevated volatility in the current environment, we believe it will be a multiyear journey before our exceptionally strong cash and credit metrics move fully back to long-term levels consistent with our single A credit ratings. \n Before I turn to our expectations, I want to close my review of our current performance with a brief discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the performance of our investment decisions over time. For the trailing 12 months through the end of the second quarter, Target's after-tax ROIC was 31.7% compared with 17.2% a year ago. This is an amazing number and a testament to the performance of our business model and our team over the last year. As we've said before, we expect this metric could settle back into the mid to high 20s over time, but to deliver a sustainable after-tax return in that range is a remarkable performance in any industry. And these superior returns are one of the many reasons we're eager to continue investing in the growth and resilience of our business to the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\n Now let's turn to our comp sales expectations for the fall season. As you'll recall, in our conference call 90 days ago, we described how our business was positioned to deliver single-digit comp growth in the back half of the year, on top of very strong growth of more than 20% in the back half of 2020. While the environment remains volatile today, and there are many uncertainties as we look ahead, Target's performance through the first half of the year has consistently exceeded our expectations. This performance, combined with the continued strength in the U.S. consumer, gives us increasing confidence that this fall, our business can generate comparable sales growth in the high single-digit range, near the high end of our previous guidance range.\n We have a similar outlook regarding profitability. 90 days ago, we said we expected our full year operating margin rate would be well above the 2020 rate of 7%, with a potential for it to reach 8% or somewhat higher. From today's perspective, based on our expectation of high single-digit comp growth in the fall, we expect to see an operating margin rate near the high end of our previous range. Specifically, we now believe that Target is positioned to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher for the full year. \n I've been at Target for more than 17 years now, and I've never experienced a time like this when every aspect of our diverse strategy is coming together like we're seeing today. Obviously, our guests are noticing, too, based on their higher level of engagement, which you can see in our outstanding performance.\n Typically, in retail, if you saw a large, mature company like ours growing at the rate we're seeing today, you'd assume we were comping over soft numbers from the prior year. Instead, we're comping over a year of record growth in 2020 on both the top and bottom lines. \n Like Brian said earlier, our success begins and ends with the team. So on behalf of all of our stakeholders, I'd like to close my remarks today by thanking the entire Target team for the exceptional results we're reporting today. \n Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on Michael's last point, which is the way we've been able to synchronize every aspect of our strategy. A few years ago, we embarked on a project to better articulate our company purpose. Across our team, there was already a strong sense of who we are and what we stand for, but we wanted to put it into words distinctly.\n Out of that work came the purpose we articulate today: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Those words have deep meaning for our team: families, discovery, joy and the word all, which represents our strong commitment to inclusion across every aspect of our business.\n Some might ask if everyone at Target already had a strong sense of purpose, why go to the trouble of putting it into words? The answer is the alignment that it creates, alignment of our strategy and alignment of our team. In the same way we had a focus on what really matters most in our articulation of our purpose, we're relying on that purpose to focus both our strategic work and our everyday activities. \n If we find ourselves working on something that doesn't advance our purpose, we can set it aside and relentlessly focus on the things that will move Target forward. That kind of focus has enabled the performance we're reporting today, and it's behind all of our investments, strategies and activities as we look ahead. \n With that, let's move to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Two questions. My first question is, can you talk about what you're seeing in back-to-school so far? Are you seeing any effect from Delta on purchasing patterns? And how are you thinking about growth in the different categories as you move forward relative to the second quarter? \nBrian Cornell: Chris, we're off to a really strong back-to-school start, and it is broad-based right now. Christina and Michael, John and I were out in stores yesterday, and we were seeing guests shopping our entire back-to-school assortment. I think we've got a great assortment at a tremendous value, and we're off to a really strong back-to-school and back-to-college season. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then a follow-up, Mike, on the gross margin. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the gross margin in the back half overall? And within that, what are the puts and takes? Does that -- do the product and freight headwinds persist or perhaps elevate? And to what degree are you assuming higher clearance and promotion levels to drive the 8% or more operating margin outlook? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Chris, you've heard us talk over time about all the levers we have within the business to offset some of those puts and takes. And I think the second quarter is a really good example of that. If you take out the sales return adjustment in last year's actuals, margins were essentially flat year-over-year. And so we found some good offsets there and feel really good about our profit performance. \n I actually think that same theme comes through loud and clear if we zoom out a little bit and look at a longer time period. If you go back to first half of this year versus first half of 2019, 2019 gross margin rate was 30.1% for the Q1 and Q2 season. We're sitting at 30.4% right now in Q2 and 30.2% for the spring. And so a lot's happened over the last 2 years, and we feel really good about our ability to manage the profitability of the business. And I think that bodes well for the back half of this year and beyond. \nOperator: The next question is from Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Two quick ones. Just curious on the inflation front, if you can maybe talk about the cost pressures that you're seeing in the food grocery category versus general merchandise, any quantification that you might be able to provide.\n And also wanted to go back to private label performance. You mentioned it grew faster in 2Q. Curious what sort of the gross margin tailwind that provided. And how do you see private label performance playing out in the second half? Is that going to be a continued gross margin driver for you? \nBrian Cornell: Well, let's have Christina talk about the strength we're seeing in our owned brand performance and how we're managing costs in this environment. \nA. Hennington: I'd be happy to take that one. Let's start with owned brands. As you know, owned brands are a huge part of our strategic imperative and desire to continue to differentiate in the market, bring great quality products to our guests. And so our commitment is to continue to accelerate our owned brands at a faster rate than our base, and that is what exactly what we saw in the second quarter. That's the pattern we've been on. And as long as we continue to find unique opportunities to meet the guests' needs, that's going to persist. \n And so you also know that owned brands represent a big portion of our sales mix, but even a bigger portion of our gross margin. So that creates tailwind for us on the profit side.\n And then going back to your first question on costs, yes, we're seeing cost pressures on product costs as well as freight. But going back to Michael's point, this is what we do every day. We manage the profitability of the business by leveraging the full suite of levers that we have to offer great value to our guests while delivering on the financial expectations you have. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: So I wanted to just ask, you look at your sales productivity, you're up more than 40% on a sales per square foot basis since 2017. So I guess what I'm wondering is, with this higher productivity, how should we think about kind of the long-term margin structure? Or maybe said a little differently, would you look to lean into investments going forward? Or could we expect a little more sustainability in terms of the higher operating margin structure? \nMichael Fiddelke: If I step back from your question a little bit, Karen, at the end of the day, growth powers so much of our margin equation. And that's why we're so focused on investments that drive growth. And you can certainly see that in the improved productivity. That comes to bear. And the math we do on new stores, that comes to bear for how we adjust our store footprint in a remodel. And so you'll see us consistently focused on investments that drive growth. With that growth comes good productivity on a per square foot basis, and we can translate that growth to good bottom line profit. \nBrian Cornell: Karen, Michael summarized it well. I mean our theme for this quarter was growth on top of growth. But you should expect that theme to continue going forward. We're going to continue to invest in our stores. John talked about the remodel plans that we have in place. We'll continue to invest in new, highly productive stores, invest in our brands, invest in our fulfillment services and invest in our team. And our focus on continuing to drive consistent growth and market share expansion quarter after quarter will be a theme you'll hear for years to come. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then just you also commented on the 70 basis points of gross margin pressure from higher product and freight costs. On the product front, can you maybe just give a little color on what you're seeing on the cost inflation versus the retail inflation? And are you absorbing some of that cost inflation? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I think Christina said it well, our teams are experts at managing the puts and takes across the business. So if we rewind the clock a couple of years ago, we'll be talking about tariffs and how we offset that. And I feel really good about how our teams manage any complexity in the business. \n To underscore something Christina also said, value matters, and we'll be laser-focused on making sure our guests find incredible value on our site and in our stores. And so we've done a lot of hard work to invest in solid price perception. And we want to make sure that our guests continue to find that value going forward, inflation or not. \nOperator: The next question is from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: I guess the first one I have is, obviously, you're holding a lot of cash on your balance sheet. You guys talked about the new share repurchase. But what is the ideal level of cash for you guys to hold? And what do you do with what you got now, I guess, in more of the short term? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Well, the answer to that question, priority 1 has been and always will be invest in the business. And continuing to invest to drive growth is the first use of that cash. Our second capital priority is to support the dividend. We announced just last month a north of 30% increase in our per share dividend. And we have the good fortune of a business that continues to generate a lot of cash as we grow. And so that gives us capacity for share repurchase as well. \n Over time, you'll see us carry less cash than that $7.4 billion we have today to be sure. Optimal and normal times, it's something closer to flat to a little north of that cash on the balance sheet, depending on the period of the year we're in. But we want to be prudent about how we kind of step back into the sweet spot of our middle A credit ratings. \nScott Mushkin: Okay. Great. And then my second question is really, I guess, more strategic over the next 12 to 18 months. Brian, I think you went over just what tremendous work the team has done. But if you step back and look at the next 12 to 18 months, what are the biggest, I guess, initiatives going forward that would drive outsized growth, that market share gain compared to competitors? \nBrian Cornell: Scott, It will be a very familiar theme to you. We're going to continue to invest in remodeling our stores. And despite the progress we've made, and we've remodeled just about half our stores today. So you'll continue to see us invest in remodels. \n We've got a very strong pipeline of new stores that we'll be rolling out over the next few years. We'll continue to invest in our brands and our owned brand performance. You'll continue to see us continue to invest in Drive Up and pickup and the expansion of Shipt. And we'll continue to invest in our team, again, all built around that thematic of growth. \n And as we think about the key metrics going forward, you'll hear us talk about traffic, and we felt exceptionally good this quarter about driving traffic growth of almost 13%, continue to drive strong comps in both our stores and digital channels. And we'll continue to make sure we always are laser-focused on market share gains. \n So those themes will be very consistent going forward. The investments we make in our stores, our brands, our fulfillment channels and our team will continue to drive traffic to our stores and visits to our site, continue to drive strong comps that equate to market share gains across our entire portfolio. So that's our continued commitment for not just the next few quarters but for years to come. \nScott Mushkin: Perfect. And what a tremendous job you guys have done. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Target continues to see outsized gains in traffic. Over the last 90 days, has there been any change in the nature of the pattern of traffic, more weekly traffic versus weekend, especially as consumers go out and travel and do other activities? And how are you expecting your traffic to unfold over the next couple of quarters as you guide to high single digits for the back half of the year? \nA. Hennington: Michael, maybe I can jump in on this one. Traffic has been very consistent, and it's been consistently strong. And we're very excited about the early momentum in back-to-school and back-to-college as well. What I would tell you is that the strength of our portfolio allows us to flex between patterns in consumer behavior changes that are more at the micro level, not at the aggregate level. The aggregate has been consistent and healthy. \n But there are behavior changes within businesses. We've talked about the fact that last year, there was a bigger need for household essentials and people were stocking up. Now we're seeing less of that, and we're seeing more the return to going out. And therefore, they're wearing dresses and beauty products, and luggage business has been very strong. So there are patterns underneath, but the macro and aggregate is that Target is outpacing the industry. And it's really led by broad-based strength across all of our businesses. \nBrian Cornell: And Michael, I would just come back to -- I know there's been lots of questions about the impact of the Delta variant. And we watch this very carefully. We're obviously very focused on safety. But we continue to see a very optimistic consumer, certainly shopping with caution and they're wearing masks more and more across the country. But we're seeing tremendous resilience in the consumer today. And our traffic patterns, I think, represent that, as we see this consistent flow of traffic into our stores. So a very resilient consumer. And we're seeing that as we start the third quarter. That traffic pattern and that resilience is continuing. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, after 1.5 years past the start of the pandemic, you've comped the comp, you've seen really sizable returns on the investments that you've made and you've entered into a stable operating rhythm. So why wouldn't Target now be able to sustain at least an 8% operating margin over the long run? Is there something unique about this current environment such as a low level of promotional activity that might return in the future that would weigh on Target's profitability? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. So Michael, there's always something unique in the environment. I can't remember one of these calls where there wasn't a specific good guy or bad guy on the margin line we weren't talking about. And so I think what matters most is our ability to put together a P&L that hangs together great, and that always starts with sales growth. \n And so while we aren't in a position today to share a new algorithm, go forward, we'll be centered on continued sales growth and continued market share gains. And with those, I'm confident in our team's ability to put together a P&L that translates into a bottom line we'll all feel good about. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nEdward Yruma: I guess, first, just to click down a little bit on the ship-to-home that you said was negative, was that just a symptom of kind of tough compares and the decision with consumers see that same-day digital services?\n And then I guess as a broader question between the really strong growth you've had in Target Circle and your digital businesses, you have a lot more data on your consumer today. I guess how are you acting on that on a real-time basis? And kind of what have you learned? \nJohn Mulligan: Ed, this is John. On the ship-to-home, I think you hit right on it, there's really 2 things going on. Just tremendous growth last year in ship-to-home at -- particularly early in the second quarter last year. So very, very strong growth, and we're just comping over that. \n I think the second thing, and probably more importantly, is the continued growth in our same-day services, tremendous growth in Shipt, in Order Pickup and Drive Up. And the growth in Drive Up is truly remarkable, but the one I like to look at is Order Pickup. We started that 6 years ago, and it continues to grow meaningfully quarter after quarter, year after year after year. So all 3 of those are acting incrementally each year and not taking business away from each other. \n And as you know, the thing we love about that, it's great service for our guests. They're our highest-rated services. Drive Up is the single highest-rated service we have. But also for us, it's fast and very, very efficient. And we love the margin that comes along with those products. So as we've grown our digital businesses over the last several years, and in particular over the last 18 months, the same-day services have grown significantly faster, and that's good margin for our digital business. \nA. Hennington: And Ed, I can jump in on the Target Circle component. As you accurately reflected in your question, it's been a great program for us, and we're up to over 100 million members in Target Circle, 100 million. It's quite substantial. And what primarily this is about is obviously making sure that we are more relevant to our consumer in giving them great deals, more personalized offers and relevancy that they appreciate.\n And so as an example, in the second quarter, guests benefited from $70 million of savings from the 1% earnings on purchases plus another $600 million worth of savings from the promotional offers. So in our commitment to offer affordability, accessibility, Target Circle is just another amazing proof point that we'll keep building on. \nOperator: The next question is from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: Congratulations on the results. My question is about the second half OpEx, and just trying to bridge your comments on operating margin for the year to the second half plans on a year-over-year basis. And I think, Christina, you might have mentioned that marketing as a focus for the back half. Maybe talk a little bit about how much you spend on emphasizing your same-day services versus how you plan to communicate to the consumer your value message in some of your key categories of emphasis. \nBrian Cornell: Steph, I might start. I think you've actually answered the question for us. You'll see us balance our messaging in the holidays around obviously, affordability, great value. We'll certainly emphasize our same-day services, and we know how important they'll be for the guests during that holiday season, and the strength of our multi-category assortment. So it will be a very steady stream of great product news, great service news and will underscore value. \nOperator: And does that conclude your questions? \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: I did have one follow-up. I'm just trying to understand the OpEx spend for the back half. Could you just give us some context around, is that the step-up in marketing is what we're seeing in terms of the year-over-year offset versus prior year? Is there something else happening in operating expenses if gross margins are going to be flat, but operating margins are going to be down a bit to the prior year? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. We aren't getting into the specifics for gross margin or SG&A. It's all wrapped into our expectation for that OpEx line on the year. And similar to the second quarter, I expect you'll see some puts and takes. I mean one of the things we're excited about in Q2 is to get back to a more normalized level of marketing spend because we kind of had to put our foot on the hose last year as we changed course in the early stages of the pandemic. And so we feel good about returning to what I view as a really healthy level of marketing investment that should power growth in the back half of the year. \nOperator: The next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: I was hoping you could comment on how much more items you have to go to add to Drive Up. So I think you guys said 5,000 items were added in 2Q. How much more is there to go on Drive Up that can kind of keep driving that super growth of that business? \n And then kind of related to that, grocery, you added a lot of fresh items on Drive Up. Did you add a lot of fresh items in general to the grocery mix? And maybe can you speak to how much further Target can go on grocery? I know historically you've said you're not really a full grocery destination. But are you moving towards adding enough items to be more of a full grocery shop? \nJohn Mulligan: Robby, first on the Drive Up question, I think there's 2 things there that really are driving growth. First is category expansion, like you said. And we continue to work our way through the through the categories there. There's work for us to do. We'd like to add things like clearance to Drive Up. And we'd like to add returns to Drive Up. And so I think there's a lot further we can go there from a category or product perspective.\n The other side is just improving the service itself, and you'll see us continue to do that. We added more Drive Up locations. We're adding canopies to help with the weather. We added numbered parking lots so that we can find your black SUV among the 12 black SUVs that sit out in our parking lot waiting for Drive Up at any given time. And we added substitutions. And we added the ability to add another driver to come do your pickup order for you. So I think you'll see us continue to innovate the service as well. \n So we see a long runway for us to continue to improve driveway (sic) [ Drive Up ]. And at the core of that, of course, is continued high execution from our store teams which leads to very, very high NPS scores that we see in Drive Up. And Christina, I'll let you talk about the food assortment. \nA. Hennington: Yes. The Food & Beverage business has been a real source of strength for us and continues to do exceptionally well, including our owned brands that we have launched. Good & Gather and Favorite Day are growing because they're just so relevant. They taste delicious. They look great. They're across the whole portfolio, and guests are finding them easily amongst the assortment. \n On your question about, is the assortment expanding? Or is it really the expansion on to Drive Up. The assortment is always going to be a curated point of view. But when a guest starts in the digital experience rather than the physical experience, there is much more understanding of who we are, and they quickly are converting because of that convenience in Drive Up to Target Food & Beverage. And I think you will see a lot of upside in the future from the success that we've built over the last several years in this business. \nOperator: Our last question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Just wanted to ask another question about EBIT margins clearly coming in higher than expected for the year. But just looking at the first half of 9.8%, it suggests something in the low to mid-6% range for the second half. And I realized Target's typical cadence is for lower EBIT margins in the second half, but this seems -- the magnitude of this deceleration seems to be about twice as much as the historical pattern. So just trying to get a sense of conservatism or costs in the back half. You called out the marketing expense, or just what you're planning for promotional activity in the back half. Maybe any color you could help with that. \nMichael Fiddelke: You're right, Kelly, there's some seasonality to how profit flows through our P&L quarter-by-quarter, spring versus fall. We feel really good about the back half of the year and the growth we expect to deliver, and we think that yields 8% or north-of-there operating margins for the year. And so while getting too precise on any specific line, I think, would be an exercise in imprecision right now, we're really confident we'll be able to put that all together for a profit rate in the back half of the year that we feel good about. \nBrian Cornell: Well, operator, that concludes our second quarter call. Thank you for joining us today. Enjoy the rest of the summer, and we look forward to talking to you later in the year. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. As I've mentioned before, I'm an engineer by training. So it probably comes as no surprise that I'm naturally interested in machines and automation. And obviously, when our team works to optimize Target's operations, both for today and in the future, we have access to every available tool and technology, robotics, automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and more. But when we choose to invest in technology, we're not looking to remove the human element from the Target experience. Instead, we're investing to enhance the productivity of our team members, freeing them up to focus on what's most important, like serving our guests.\n This is another example of the power of and how it runs through every part of our business. The choice doesn't have to be about people or technology. We can invest in both people and their productivity. \n Here's one way to think about it. In our 2015 annual report, we reported that Target had around 341,000 team members as we entered 2016, a year in which our business generated just over $69 billion in sales. 5 years later, our 2020 annual report showed that we had about 409,000 team members going into this year, representing about 20% growth in the number of team members over that 5-year period. \n However, based on our results so far and our expectations for the back half of the year, our business is positioned to deliver more than $100 billion in sales this year, representing growth of 45% or more compared with 5 years ago. So even as we've added nearly 70,000 people to our team, we've also benefited from a significant increase in their productivity, creating financial capacity to provide enhanced service for our guests and make significant investments in pay and benefits. \n And as Brian mentioned, our team has been performing at an incredibly high level, raising the bar on historically strong execution. Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw an improvement in already high Net Promoter Scores for all 3 of our same-day services, most notably for the in-store pickup experience. In addition, Drive Up, which remains our highest-rated service, saw an increase in guest satisfaction compared with last year, on top of last year's improvements over 2019.\n And we continue to find ways to enhance our industry-leading pickup and Drive Up capabilities. In the second quarter, we added another 5,000 items to the assortment available for pickup and Drive Up, ranging from items in adult beverages to fresh pet food, meal kits and greeting cards. We also continue to roll out technology enhancements, including functionality to provide backup suggestions when an item is unavailable, a chain-wide rollout of numbered parking spaces for guests using Drive Up and the ability in the app to seamlessly designate an alternate person to pick up an order.\n Beyond same-day capabilities, we also saw a meaningful increase in satisfaction with our in-store shopping experience, driven by improvements across multiple attributes, most notably around team member interactions, both on the sales floor and at checkout. These increases reflect the impact of our new service initiatives, which focus on serving our guests on their own terms, while authentically bringing our company purpose to life through the guest experience.\n This spring, more than 300,000 team members completed training on these initiatives, offering them tools to provide a consistent, differentiated shopping experience regardless of how our guests choose to shop. Higher guest satisfaction scores provide clear evidence that our team has enthusiastically embraced this training as they build their confidence and expertise in establishing authentic connections with our guests.\n As Christina mentioned, our teams at headquarters have also done a great job as they navigate multiple challenges across the supply chain. And while we're happy that in-stocks have improved meaningfully compared with a year ago, we have more work to do as our guests are still seeing empty shelves on some occasions. In some of those situations, we've simply sold beyond our expectations, and our team is working quickly to secure additional quantities. In other cases, the vendors themselves are facing constraints in their ability to deliver product. And we're collaborating with them to address these constraints together, securing as much product as possible on behalf of our guests.\n And our team has been successfully addressing supply chain bottlenecks, which are affecting both domestic freight and international shipping. Steps include expedited ordering and larger upfront quantities in advance of a season, mitigating the risk that replenishment could take longer than usual. Bottom line, with Q2 ending inventory up more than 26% or nearly $2.5 billion compared with a year ago, we believe we're well positioned for the fall and ready to deliver strong growth on top of last year's record increases.\n In everyday life, when you see an artist, performer or athlete who's at the top of their craft, they typically make their work look simple. The mastery they've achieved makes it easy to look past all the effort and passion behind their high level of performance. That's true in business as well. When you see a successful company generating impressive growth on both the top line and the bottom line, it's easy to miss the passion and hard work of the team that's delivering that performance. So as always, I want to pause and thank our team members everywhere in the world for everything they do to propel our business forward regardless of the challenges that come their way.\n Our properties team has had a busy year as they ramp up our remodel program following last year's temporary suspension. In addition, they're working to open new neighborhood stores, distribution centers and sortation centers across the country. More than 100 remodel projects are currently in flight, and we're on track to complete about 140 remodels in 2021 and an even higher number in 2022. \n The team has also opened 19 new stores this year, spanning from 3 more stores in New York City to all the way across the country in Hollywood. We're on track to open 12 more stores this fall, including a new location in Orlando adjacent to Disney World, a new site in Hawaii and a campus location in Madison, Wisconsin, welcome news to all my fellow Badgers out there.\n We opened 2 new distribution facilities in the second quarter: 1 in New Jersey and another near Chicago, creating additional replenishment capacity within our network. We're planning to add more capacity in 2022, given the sales growth we've already sustained over the last 1.5 years and the continued growth we expect to generate going forward.\n And to support our ship-from-store capability, the team is getting ready to open 2 new sortation centers in October, followed by 2 more after the holidays. These new facilities offer faster delivery times at a lower cost in markets with a high density of shipments. In addition, they free up backroom space at store locations they serve, expanding capacity for more digital growth over time.\n And finally, in support of our commitment to being a net 0 enterprise by 2040, the team is driving towards 0 waste to landfill in our U.S. operations and improving overall energy efficiency as we transition to renewable energy. This includes investing in contracts for off-site renewable energy and additional rooftop solar projects as we move beyond our 2020 goal of having rooftop solar at 500 facilities.\n So it's clear we have many opportunities to invest capital productively across both our stores and the broader supply chain. But I want to end my remarks where I started: with our team. I've been at Target for 25 years now, and one of the many reasons I've stayed here is the way we've always invested in our team, creating a uniquely strong culture and a high level of engagement. \n But in recent years, we've doubled down on what was already a strength. Obviously, this includes our investments in pay, including our starting wage, but it goes much further. We've also made investments in benefits and recently announced that several programs we added during the pandemic have now become ongoing benefits for all U.S.-based team members, including free access to health care through virtual doctor visits and free online resources and apps to support mental, emotional and physical health.\n And as Brian mentioned, in support of Target Forward's ambitions to advance opportunity and equity and create an equitable and inclusive workforce, we are really proud and excited to announce our new debt-free education assistance program earlier this month. We have the most comprehensive program in the industry, offering more than 340,000 team members debt-free access to undergraduate degrees, certificates, certifications and more, beginning with their first day at Target. Importantly, the program pays for smaller out-of-pocket costs, such as textbooks and course fees that might otherwise hinder participation. And for those who want to continue beyond their undergraduate education, the program will pay up to $10,000 annually for team members pursuing a master's degree. \n As Brian has said many times, of all the investments we've made over the last 5 years, none have been more impactful than the ones we've made in our team. And like any investment that's generating a high return, we continue to look for opportunities to do more, deepening our team's connection with Target, while they deepen Target's relationship with our guests.\n Because of the investments we've made over time, store team member turnover remains low at a time when the labor market has been heating up to levels we haven't seen in a very long time. That's one of the many reasons I'm grateful to serve alongside this great team, and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. Ed, this is John. On the ship-to-home, I think you hit right on it, there's really 2 things going on. Just tremendous growth last year in ship-to-home at -- particularly early in the second quarter last year. So very, very strong growth, and we're just comping over that. \n I think the second thing, and probably more importantly, is the continued growth in our same-day services, tremendous growth in Shipt, in Order Pickup and Drive Up. And the growth in Drive Up is truly remarkable, but the one I like to look at is Order Pickup. We started that 6 years ago, and it continues to grow meaningfully quarter after quarter, year after year after year. So all 3 of those are acting incrementally each year and not taking business away from each other. \n And as you know, the thing we love about that, it's great service for our guests.

And Christina, I'll let you talk about the food assortment."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance showed that Target's leadership position is stronger than it's ever been, fueled by a one-of-a-kind strategy, resilient operations and a passionate, world-class team. \n As you know, we've been investing for years to build the durable model that's in place today, one that puts our guests first and leverages all of our assets and capabilities to serve their evolving wants and needs. After years of investment and effort in building this model, it's clear that we've only begun to scratch the surface of what's possible over time.\n In the second quarter, our business continued to perform and grow on both the top and bottom lines, even as we comped over record performance a year ago. Of course, seeing growth on top of growth is nothing new. Our business is already delivering consistent increases in sales and profitability in the years leading up to the pandemic. This was followed by a dramatic acceleration in 2020 and this year's continued growth.\n In the second quarter, Target's comparable sales increased 8.9% on top of a record 24.3% growth a year ago. As a result, second quarter total sales have expanded more than 36% or more than $6.6 billion over the last 2 years.\n On the bottom line, we earned second quarter adjusted EPS of $3.64, up nearly 8% compared with last year and double our performance 2 years ago.\n As we described last quarter, guests have emerged from a year in which digital was the primary growth driver, and they're now returning to our stores in droves. As a result, the majority of our second quarter growth was driven by the stores channel, where comps grew 8.7% on top of 10.9% a year ago. In addition, traffic accounted for more than 100% of our second quarter growth, in contrast to a year ago when guests were limiting time out of their homes and the bulk of our growth was coming from bigger transactions.\n Comparable digital sales grew 10% in the second quarter, building on the record growth of 195% last year. The digital channel continues to be led by our same-day services, in-store pickup, Drive Up and Shipt, which together grew 55% this year on top of more than 270% last year. Given their rapid expansion, same-day services now account for well over half of our digital sales. \n Among those same-day options, Drive Up has quickly grown to be the largest, accounting for more sales than pickup and Shipt combined. To put it in dollar terms, over the last 2 years, second quarter sales through Drive Up alone have increased by nearly $1.4 billion. And for the spring season, they've expanded by double that amount. \n Beyond our fulfillment options, we continue to benefit from our unique multi-category assortment, which is perfectly positioned to serve our guests' evolving wants and needs. As a result, comp sales in all 5 of our core categories expanded in the second quarter on top of strong growth a year ago. As expected, apparel continued to lead the way as our guests continue to respond to newness and style across both our owned and national brands throughout the assortment. \n Also as expected, we saw more moderate growth in our Hardlines and home categories this year as they expanded on top of really strong comparisons from a year ago. And notably, we continue to benefit from impressive performance across our less discretionary Food & Beverage and essential categories. These categories have again consistently delivered strong growth and market share gains, both in 2020 and again this year. I'll let Christina provide more details in a few minutes.\n When we talk with many of you about what's driving Target performance, we often hear the question, \"What's the one thing that's been the key?\" The honest answer to that question, we can't point to any one thing. Rather, it's been everything working together that's driven our performance. This includes our supply chain work, which has positioned our stores as fulfillment hubs, while transforming the way we replenish store inventory. Then there's our rollout of same-day services, which began more than 5 years ago with in-store pickup, followed by the nationwide rollout of Drive Up and Shipt beginning in 2018. \n And there's the refreshment of our own brands, which began in 2016 with the rollout of Cat & Jack, followed by dozens of new owned brands over the last 5 years. At the same time, we've expanded our partnerships with premium national brands, including Disney, Levi's and Apple and, most recently, this month's opening of more than 100 Ulta Beauty shop in shops. Across our store portfolio, we began testing small formats in 2014. And we now have more than 140 of these productive neighborhood locations across the country.\n We've also remodeled more than half the chain over the last 4 years, transforming the shopping environment while optimizing the layout in support of our same-day services. And we've reinvented our store operating model, focusing on enhanced service and subject matter expertise in key categories while investing in visual merchandising across our network.\n Then there's Target Circle, which launched in 2019 and now has more than 100 million members, providing a new connection with our guests while offering meaningful rewards.\n And of course, we made multiple investments in our team, including the attainment of our goal to bring Target's nationwide starting wage up to $15 or more. This was certainly an important milestone, but far from the end of the journey. Just a few weeks ago, we announced an investment of more than $75 million to provide $200 recognition bonuses to all of our frontline, hourly, full-time and part-time team members across our stores, distribution centers and contact centers. \n I've said it many times before, but I can't say it enough. Our team is the lifeblood of Target. And our success begins and ends with them. I want to thank each of them and every one of them across the world for everything they do to make Target such a special place to shop and a great place to work and build a rewarding career. And today, given the profitable growth that comes from all of these efforts, we can continue to invest in making our business even stronger and more durable over time. \n In June, we were incredibly excited to launch Target Forward, an ambitious new sustainability strategy grounded in the vision to co-create an equitable and regenerative future with our guests, partners and communities. Target Forward is centered around 3 critical ambitions: to design and elevate sustainable brands, innovate to eliminate waste and accelerate opportunity and equity. This bold initiative is the beginning of the new chapter for how we'll define sustainability, position our business for long-term growth and resiliency and build on our rich legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices.\n As part of these efforts, in early August we announced that this fall, Target will be rolling out an industry-leading program to provide debt-free educational assistance for all of our U.S.-based full-time and part-time team members. This program will provide access to more than 250 business-aligned programs at more than 40 educational institutions, including historical black colleges and universities, along with institutions serving the Hispanic community. In total, we plan to spend $200 million to offer this benefit over the next 4 years, serving as a meaningful example of how we're investing to promote opportunity and equity in our communities, beginning with our own team. \n So now before I turn the call over to Christina, I want to acknowledge the likelihood that the second half of the year will continue to be volatile, particularly in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant. Of course, safety remains our #1 priority, as evident in the way we operate our stores and our ongoing investments to encourage vaccinations by making them easy and accessible for both our team and our guests.\n In terms of our business, the last 18 months have proven, beyond a doubt, the flexibility and resilience of both our team and our business model. And while sales in stores have been soaring so far this year, our operations and team have demonstrated how they can pivot seamlessly between stores and digital commerce based on how our guests choose to shop. I also want to emphasize that as proud as we are of what we've already accomplished, we see many more productive opportunities to invest in continued growth. \n And I also want to acknowledge the continued high level of execution we've been seeing across all of our teams. As John will outline in more detail, despite unusually high volatility for well over a year now, the Target team has been consistently setting the industry standard in terms of execution despite multiple challenges in the external environment. \n Our team continues to embrace every challenge as one aligned Target team, taking care of each other as they focus on serving our guests. I am truly inspired by their work and grateful to share the outstanding performance they're delivering quarter after quarter, year after year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on Michael's last point, which is the way we've been able to synchronize every aspect of our strategy. A few years ago, we embarked on a project to better articulate our company purpose. Across our team, there was already a strong sense of who we are and what we stand for, but we wanted to put it into words distinctly.\n Out of that work came the purpose we articulate today: to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Those words have deep meaning for our team: families, discovery, joy and the word all, which represents our strong commitment to inclusion across every aspect of our business.\n Some might ask if everyone at Target already had a strong sense of purpose, why go to the trouble of putting it into words? The answer is the alignment that it creates, alignment of our strategy and alignment of our team. In the same way we had a focus on what really matters most in our articulation of our purpose, we're relying on that purpose to focus both our strategic work and our everyday activities. \n If we find ourselves working on something that doesn't advance our purpose, we can set it aside and relentlessly focus on the things that will move Target forward. That kind of focus has enabled the performance we're reporting today, and it's behind all of our investments, strategies and activities as we look ahead. \n With that, let's move to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Chris, we're off to a really strong back-to-school start, and it is broad-based right now. Christina and Michael, John and I were out in stores yesterday, and we were seeing guests shopping our entire back-to-school assortment. I think we've got a great assortment at a tremendous value, and we're off to a really strong back-to-school and back-to-college season. Well, let's have Christina talk about the strength we're seeing in our owned brand performance and how we're managing costs in this environment. Karen, Michael summarized it well. I mean our theme for this quarter was growth on top of growth. But you should expect that theme to continue going forward. We're going to continue to invest in our stores. John talked about the remodel plans that we have in place. We'll continue to invest in new, highly productive stores, invest in our brands, invest in our fulfillment services and invest in our team. And our focus on continuing to drive consistent growth and market share expansion quarter after quarter will be a theme you'll hear for years to come. Scott, It will be a very familiar theme to you. We're going to continue to invest in remodeling our stores. And despite the progress we've made, and we've remodeled just about half our stores today. So you'll continue to see us invest in remodels. \n We've got a very strong pipeline of new stores that we'll be rolling out over the next few years. We'll continue to invest in our brands and our owned brand performance. You'll continue to see us continue to invest in Drive Up and pickup and the expansion of Shipt. And we'll continue to invest in our team, again, all built around that thematic of growth. \n And as we think about the key metrics going forward, you'll hear us talk about traffic, and we felt exceptionally good this quarter about driving traffic growth of almost 13%, continue to drive strong comps in both our stores and digital channels. And we'll continue to make sure we always are laser-focused on market share gains. \n So those themes will be very consistent going forward. The investments we make in our stores, our brands, our fulfillment channels and our team will continue to drive traffic to our stores and visits to our site, continue to drive strong comps that equate to market share gains across our entire portfolio. So that's our continued commitment for not just the next few quarters but for years to come. And Michael, I would just come back to -- I know there's been lots of questions about the impact of the Delta variant. And we watch this very carefully. We're obviously very focused on safety. But we continue to see a very optimistic consumer, certainly shopping with caution and they're wearing masks more and more across the country. But we're seeing tremendous resilience in the consumer today. And our traffic patterns, I think, represent that, as we see this consistent flow of traffic into our stores. So a very resilient consumer. And we're seeing that as we start the third quarter. That traffic pattern and that resilience is continuing. Steph, I might start. I think you've actually answered the question for us. You'll see us balance our messaging in the holidays around obviously, affordability, great value. We'll certainly emphasize our same-day services, and we know how important they'll be for the guests during that holiday season, and the strength of our multi-category assortment. So it will be a very steady stream of great product news, great service news and will underscore value. Well, operator, that concludes our second quarter call. Thank you for joining us today. Enjoy the rest of the summer, and we look forward to talking to you later in the year. Thank you."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our guests is at the forefront of every decision we make. By listening intently to them, anticipating their wants and needs and building our strategy around them, we can drive deeper engagement, trust and a stronger preference for Target over time. \n We built our same-day capabilities with that guest-first focus. And as we've shared before, when guests try services like Drive Up or Shipt for the first time, their overall spending increases, including an increase in conventional store shopping. In other words, digital engagement drives more engagement in our stores, providing us with more and more opportunities to surprise, delight and inspire them. This is one example of many showing how growth today creates a platform for additional growth in the future.\n And of course, we wouldn't be where we are today without the best team in retail. So I want to take a moment and thank our entire team for delivering superior performance in a continued volatile environment even as they face ongoing challenges presented by the Delta variant, product cost inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and more.\n Target's second quarter performance also demonstrates the strength and durability of our business model. Our unique, multi-category assortment offers the right balance of what our guests want and need even as they change, sometimes rapidly. As a result, despite record-setting growth last year, all 5 of our core merchandising categories grew again this year, proving that there's still plenty of runway ahead.\n Second quarter results were strongest in apparel, which delivered mid-teens growth on top of low double-digit growth last year. Within apparel, swim, kids and young contemporary all delivered comps in the low 20% range. \n Food & Beverage delivered low double-digit growth in the second quarter. Performance was led by our bakery, cafe and deli businesses, which grew more than 50% as these departments were closed during part of the second quarter last year. We also saw double-digit growth in our fresh categories, benefiting from an expansion in the number of items available for Drive Up. In fact, nearly half of this year's growth in our produce business has been driven by the growth in Drive Up orders.\n The Essentials & Beauty category delivered high single-digit growth this quarter. Within essentials, baby care grew by more than 20%, and we saw mid to high teens growth in both pets and health care. Beauty continued to gain market share on comp growth in the high single-digit range in advance of this month's rollout of our in-store partnership with Ulta Beauty.\n Hardlines delivered mid-single-digit growth this quarter on top of more than 40% growth a year ago. We continue to benefit from strong momentum in toys, which grew in the low 20% range. Sporting goods was also a standout with growth in the high teens. As expected, electronics experienced a moderate comp decline in the mid-single-digit range as it comped over last year's growth of more than 70% during a period when some competitors were closed. Importantly, over the last 2 years, both Hardlines and electronics have delivered strong growth and market share gains. \n And finally, in home, following comp growth of more than 30% last year, we saw a low single-digit increase in the second quarter. Within home, we've seen moderating trends in categories like kitchen, storage and decor as they comped over outsized growth last year. At the same time, given our guests' increasing focus on gathering and celebrating holidays and family milestones, we've seen an acceleration in our seasonal and stationary categories, providing another example of the power of our broad, multi-category model.\n And beyond individual categories, our diverse collection of owned brands continues to grow and provide differentiation across our assortment. In the second quarter, owned brand sales outpaced the company with growth in the mid-teens. And in Food & Beverage, where we're seeing tremendous growth in Good & Gather and encouraging results in our new brand, Favorite Day, we saw an increase in owned brand penetration of about 70 basis points compared with last year.\n As we look ahead, despite uncertainties around the Delta variant and rising COVID cases, consumers have healthy balance sheets and remain eager to find safe ways to connect with their loved ones and find some sense of normalcy. We'll continue to safely meet their needs and add some much needed joy. \n First on that list is this month's launch of Ulta Beauty at Target, the next chapter in Target's already strong beauty story. The shared values and cultures between our businesses and our collective desire to inspire and elevate the shopping experience make this long-term partnership a major win for both companies and our guests. And like our guests, we're incredibly excited to see this new concept come to life following months of anticipation.\n But our guests aren't just excited for their glow up to their beauty game, they're also looking for affordable options to refresh their wardrobe as they cautiously plan for more in-person interactions this fall. So it's perfect timing that this September, Target is partnering with 4 dynamic and highly regarded designers, Nili Lotan, Rachel Comey, Sandy Liang and Victor Glemaud, to create a limited time, size-inclusive apparel collection of modern and classic wardrobe staples.\n And our partnerships go well beyond apparel and beauty. In home, we've enlisted the talent of Justina Blakeney, Jungalow founder and long-time partner, to bring Junglalow's cozy, wild and free vibe into our Opalhouse line, making it the perfect addition to our eclectic owned brand.\n And for our littler guests, our newest design partnership is sure to inspire their imagination and help them to create some great new looks. Christian Robinson for Target, a full-of-wonder creation of the beloved artist, illustrator and children's book author, is a limited edition collection that includes home goods, apparel and books for kids and baby. And last, not least, for the furrier family members in your household, we have just launched Kindfull, our new pet food-owned brand focusing on healthy, sustainable and affordable food options for our beloved 4-legged friends.\n Beyond partnerships and product launches, our guests are telling us they're hungry to celebrate key holidays, life moments and everyday occasions with their loved ones, having missed out on so many of them over the last 18 months. So even as they're mindful of the ongoing risks, our guests are carefully balancing caution with optimism and focusing on finding safe and affordable ways to celebrate. \n Already in progress, the back-to-school and back-to-college seasons are off to a great start. Regardless of whether back-to-school will be in-person or hybrid, Target has everything they need to be successful in any learning environment.\n Similarly, as college freshmen look to move on to campus for the first time, our merchandising and inventory plans account for the fact that many sophomores find themselves in that same position, having attended their first year of college in a completely virtual environment.\n Given the stresses that come with the start of school, Target is focused on making things as easy as possible for families with School List Assist. This feature, online and in the Target app, allows users to easily find their school-specific supply list and either shop by item or add the whole list with a click of a button. \n And like we did for holiday last year, our back-to-school offers will be spread throughout the entire season, providing both value and a safe shopping experience for our guests. This reflects our ongoing focus on providing value that goes far beyond price. It's about affordability and accessibility all season long.\n And on that topic of providing value, we're rolling out new functionality in the Target app based on hearing from our guests that the fear of missing out on a deal is real, something affectionately known as promo FOMO. With this update, when guests add items to their cart, the app will automatically show them all the applicable Target Circle offers before checking out, reassuring them that they won't miss out on a great deal.\n Looking ahead, we'll soon be trading in shorts and t-shirts for cozy sweaters and denim as we usher in the fall. And for Halloween, no matter how you plan to celebrate, Target has a few tricks and no shortage of treats up our sleeves. We'll continue to focus on value and inspiration with affordable and exciting costumes, including a broader-than-ever array of adaptive, size-inclusive and gender-neutral options. And of course, we'll have all the sweet treats for self-indulgence and sharing with others, including great new offerings from our Hyde & EEK! and Favorite Day owned brands.\n Beyond our near-term plans, what energizes me the most is our focus on creating a more equitable, sustainable and inclusive world. This is why I'm so proud of our recently announced sustainability strategy, Target Forward, which is a comprehensive vision that touches every aspect of our business in support of people and planet. \n You've heard me talk about my role on Target's REACH Committee, which was formed with a goal of achieving lasting, systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities, serving as a perfect extension of the broader Target Forward strategy. The recruitment and retention of more diverse team members, more products from diverse suppliers, a new direction for our philanthropic efforts in communities of color and more equity for all, these are unwavering commitments in support of our goals. \n While there's much more to accomplish, I'm pleased with the progress we've already made. One example is our commitment to increase black representation across our company by 20% by the year 2023. To date, we've seen progress at all salaried levels, most notably in a nearly 25% increase among our company officers. \n So while it's incredibly rewarding to see how well our business is performing, I'm most proud of our commitment to invest in the long-term health of our team, our communities and the planet, our company purpose, focus on sustainability and then creating a more equitable and inclusive world. These are not a collection of separate initiatives tacked onto our core business. Rather, they are the bedrock of who we are and how we make decisions. While their benefit may be hard to quantify in a spreadsheet, I strongly believe that they're the foundation of how we'll grow our business, sustain our communities and move forward together over time.\n With that, I will turn the call over to John. I'd be happy to take that one. Let's start with owned brands. As you know, owned brands are a huge part of our strategic imperative and desire to continue to differentiate in the market, bring great quality products to our guests. And so our commitment is to continue to accelerate our owned brands at a faster rate than our base, and that is what exactly what we saw in the second quarter. That's the pattern we've been on. And as long as we continue to find unique opportunities to meet the guests' needs, that's going to persist. \n And so you also know that owned brands represent a big portion of our sales mix, but even a bigger portion of our gross margin. So that creates tailwind for us on the profit side.\n And then going back to your first question on costs, yes, we're seeing cost pressures on product costs as well as freight. But going back to Michael's point, this is what we do every day. We manage the profitability of the business by leveraging the full suite of levers that we have to offer great value to our guests while delivering on the financial expectations you have. Michael, maybe I can jump in on this one. Traffic has been very consistent, and it's been consistently strong. And we're very excited about the early momentum in back-to-school and back-to-college as well. What I would tell you is that the strength of our portfolio allows us to flex between patterns in consumer behavior changes that are more at the micro level, not at the aggregate level. The aggregate has been consistent and healthy. \n But there are behavior changes within businesses. We've talked about the fact that last year, there was a bigger need for household essentials and people were stocking up. Now we're seeing less of that, and we're seeing more the return to going out. And therefore, they're wearing dresses and beauty products, and luggage business has been very strong. So there are patterns underneath, but the macro and aggregate is that Target is outpacing the industry. And it's really led by broad-based strength across all of our businesses. And Ed, I can jump in on the Target Circle component. As you accurately reflected in your question, it's been a great program for us, and we're up to over 100 million members in Target Circle, 100 million. It's quite substantial. And what primarily this is about is obviously making sure that we are more relevant to our consumer in giving them great deals, more personalized offers and relevancy that they appreciate.\n And so as an example, in the second quarter, guests benefited from $70 million of savings from the 1% earnings on purchases plus another $600 million worth of savings from the promotional offers. So in our commitment to offer affordability, accessibility, Target Circle is just another amazing proof point that we'll keep building on. Yes. The Food & Beverage business has been a real source of strength for us and continues to do exceptionally well, including our owned brands that we have launched. Good & Gather and Favorite Day are growing because they're just so relevant. They taste delicious. They look great. They're across the whole portfolio, and guests are finding them easily amongst the assortment. \n On your question about, is the assortment expanding? Or is it really the expansion on to Drive Up. The assortment is always going to be a curated point of view. But when a guest starts in the digital experience rather than the physical experience, there is much more understanding of who we are, and they quickly are converting because of that convenience in Drive Up to Target Food & Beverage. And I think you will see a lot of upside in the future from the success that we've built over the last several years in this business."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. After a record year in 2020, the theme of this year's performance has been growth on top of growth. Of course, we laid the groundwork for this year's growth through the investment decisions we were making years ago in our stores, owned brands, supply chain, technology and our team. And today, we continue to see a host of opportunities to invest in our future. That certainly includes the capital we're investing in support of our stores and supply chain and the investments we're making in our team, including recently announced team member bonuses and our new debt-free education assistance program. And while the return on team member investments isn't measured as a distinct line in our financial statements, they're the most important investments we make. \n Total sales grew 9.4% in the second quarter, driven by comp growth of 8.9%. Within the quarter, May saw the smallest increase this year, given that it was comping over a 33% increase a year ago. On a 2-year basis, results were much more consistent throughout the quarter, as we saw 2-year growth in excess of 30% across all 3 months. \n As Brian mentioned, with guests spending more time out of their homes, we've seen them shopping more often and making slightly smaller trips. Specifically, traffic grew 12.7% in the second quarter, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in average ticket. However, given that last year's comp growth was primarily driven by average ticket, on a 2-year basis, we've seen double-digit increases in both traffic and ticket since 2019.\n As Brian also mentioned, the store channel has been our primary growth driver this year. Specifically, store comparable sales grew 8.7% in the second quarter. And given that store comps increased 10.9% last year, we've seen compounded growth of our in-store sales of more than 20% over the last 2 years.\n In the digital channel, comp sales grew 10% on top of 195% a year ago. And reflecting this year's change in guests' shopping habits, the mix of our digital fulfillment changed meaningfully. Specifically, same-day services grew 55% in the quarter, while sales on orders shipped to home actually declined from last year's elevated levels. This provides vivid evidence of the stickiness of our same-day services. Once guests try them, they love them. So even as they've ramped up their in-store shopping, they've continued to rely on these services as well.\n Another indication of this year's shift in guest behavior, the percent of total sales from the digital channel actually fell slightly compared with last year, moving from 17.2% in second quarter 2020 back to 17% this year. Obviously, this isn't a trend we expect will continue over time, and it's important to note that this year's digital penetration of 17% is well over double the 7.3% we reported in second quarter 2019. \n Our second quarter gross margin rate of 30.4% was down about 50 basis points from 30.9% a year ago. Among the drivers, last year's change in the sales return reserve estimate, which contributed about $110 million to second quarter gross margin last year, accounted for about 50 basis points of rate pressure this year. In other words, without last year's benefit from this change in the reserve estimate, our second quarter gross margin rate would have been about flat compared to last year. \n Among other gross margin drivers, we saw about 70 basis points of pressure in merchandising, reflecting the impact of higher product and freight costs, partially offset by the benefit of low markdown rates. This pressure was offset by about 40 basis points of tailwind for merchandise mix, combined with a small benefit from supply chain and digital fulfillment, driven by the shift in digital mix toward our less costly same-day options. \n On the SG&A expense line, we saw a rate of 19.3% this year, down about 10 basis points from last year. This change reflected the continued leverage benefit from strong sales growth, offset by pressure from an increase in some expense rates in areas like marketing from lower-than-normal levels a year ago. This year's SG&A expenses also reflect continued growth in pay and benefits for our team. On the D&A line, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from last year, driven by leverage on our sales growth. \n Altogether, second quarter operating margin rate was 9.8%, down about 20 basis points from a year ago, but more than 2.5 percentage points higher than second quarter 2019. On the bottom line, our second quarter GAAP EPS of $3.65 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and adjusted EPS of $3.64 was 7.9% above last year. Second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS have both doubled over the last 2 years.\n So far this year, our operations have generated just over $3.4 billion of cash. This is historically strong performance, but about $1.7 billion lower than a year ago due to some unique circumstances affecting last year. Specifically, our inventory position at the end of the second quarter last year was much lower than we'd have preferred given that our sales had far outpaced our expectations during the first half of the year. As a result, at this point last year, inventory turnover and payables leverage were running unusually high and would have been lower had we owned the appropriate amount of inventory to support our sales. \n As such, this year, our inventory is in a much better position, more than $2 billion higher than last year. And our payables leverage has begun to decline to a more sustainable level, both of which are near-term headwinds to operating cash flow. In addition, our year-to-date income tax payments are more than $1 billion higher than at this time last year, given the volatility in our taxable income through the first half of last year.\n As I turn to capital deployment, I want to start where I always do, which is to reiterate our priorities, which have remained the same for decades. First, we invest fully in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual dividend increases, which we've maintained every year since 1971. And finally, we return any excess cash over time through share repurchases within the limits of our strong middle A credit ratings.\n So far this year, we've invested just over $1.3 billion in CapEx to support the new store, remodel and supply chain projects that John outlined earlier. And for the year, we're now expecting CapEx in the $3.5 billion range. This is about $0.5 billion lower than our original expectation and reflects the retiming of some project spending into next year. As a result of this retiming, our view of next year's CapEx is somewhat higher than our prior view, in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. And we'll continue to refine our view as we move into next year. Bottom line, we're excited about the productive opportunities in front of us and we'll govern our investment decisions with a focus on delivering continued growth and superior returns. \n Beyond our capital investments, we paid dividends of $336 million in the second quarter, and we returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases at an average price of just over $230. And as we announced today, our Board has approved a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, which will allow us to continue buying back shares once the current $5 billion program is completed. This authorization is consistent with the capital deployment priorities I outlined above. It also reflects our confidence in the ongoing strength of our business and the robust cash flow we expect to generate over time. \n Even after this year's investments in our business and team and the return of capital to our shareholders, we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $7.4 billion. This is up slightly from a year ago and well above the cash position we expect to maintain over time. But as I've said before, given our current cash position and elevated volatility in the current environment, we believe it will be a multiyear journey before our exceptionally strong cash and credit metrics move fully back to long-term levels consistent with our single A credit ratings. \n Before I turn to our expectations, I want to close my review of our current performance with a brief discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures the performance of our investment decisions over time. For the trailing 12 months through the end of the second quarter, Target's after-tax ROIC was 31.7% compared with 17.2% a year ago. This is an amazing number and a testament to the performance of our business model and our team over the last year. As we've said before, we expect this metric could settle back into the mid to high 20s over time, but to deliver a sustainable after-tax return in that range is a remarkable performance in any industry. And these superior returns are one of the many reasons we're eager to continue investing in the growth and resilience of our business to the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\n Now let's turn to our comp sales expectations for the fall season. As you'll recall, in our conference call 90 days ago, we described how our business was positioned to deliver single-digit comp growth in the back half of the year, on top of very strong growth of more than 20% in the back half of 2020. While the environment remains volatile today, and there are many uncertainties as we look ahead, Target's performance through the first half of the year has consistently exceeded our expectations. This performance, combined with the continued strength in the U.S. consumer, gives us increasing confidence that this fall, our business can generate comparable sales growth in the high single-digit range, near the high end of our previous guidance range.\n We have a similar outlook regarding profitability. 90 days ago, we said we expected our full year operating margin rate would be well above the 2020 rate of 7%, with a potential for it to reach 8% or somewhat higher. From today's perspective, based on our expectation of high single-digit comp growth in the fall, we expect to see an operating margin rate near the high end of our previous range. Specifically, we now believe that Target is positioned to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher for the full year. \n I've been at Target for more than 17 years now, and I've never experienced a time like this when every aspect of our diverse strategy is coming together like we're seeing today. Obviously, our guests are noticing, too, based on their higher level of engagement, which you can see in our outstanding performance.\n Typically, in retail, if you saw a large, mature company like ours growing at the rate we're seeing today, you'd assume we were comping over soft numbers from the prior year. Instead, we're comping over a year of record growth in 2020 on both the top and bottom lines. \n Like Brian said earlier, our success begins and ends with the team. So on behalf of all of our stakeholders, I'd like to close my remarks today by thanking the entire Target team for the exceptional results we're reporting today. \n Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Yes. Chris, you've heard us talk over time about all the levers we have within the business to offset some of those puts and takes. And I think the second quarter is a really good example of that. If you take out the sales return adjustment in last year's actuals, margins were essentially flat year-over-year. And so we found some good offsets there and feel really good about our profit performance. \n I actually think that same theme comes through loud and clear if we zoom out a little bit and look at a longer time period. If you go back to first half of this year versus first half of 2019, 2019 gross margin rate was 30.1% for the Q1 and Q2 season. We're sitting at 30.4% right now in Q2 and 30.2% for the spring. And so a lot's happened over the last 2 years, and we feel really good about our ability to manage the profitability of the business. And I think that bodes well for the back half of this year and beyond. If I step back from your question a little bit, Karen, at the end of the day, growth powers so much of our margin equation. And that's why we're so focused on investments that drive growth. And you can certainly see that in the improved productivity. That comes to bear. And the math we do on new stores, that comes to bear for how we adjust our store footprint in a remodel. And so you'll see us consistently focused on investments that drive growth. With that growth comes good productivity on a per square foot basis, and we can translate that growth to good bottom line profit. Yes. I think Christina said it well, our teams are experts at managing the puts and takes across the business. So if we rewind the clock a couple of years ago, we'll be talking about tariffs and how we offset that. And I feel really good about how our teams manage any complexity in the business. \n To underscore something Christina also said, value matters, and we'll be laser-focused on making sure our guests find incredible value on our site and in our stores. And so we've done a lot of hard work to invest in solid price perception. And we want to make sure that our guests continue to find that value going forward, inflation or not. Yes. Well, the answer to that question, priority 1 has been and always will be invest in the business. And continuing to invest to drive growth is the first use of that cash. Our second capital priority is to support the dividend. We announced just last month a north of 30% increase in our per share dividend. And we have the good fortune of a business that continues to generate a lot of cash as we grow. And so that gives us capacity for share repurchase as well. \n Over time, you'll see us carry less cash than that $7.4 billion we have today to be sure. Optimal and normal times, it's something closer to flat to a little north of that cash on the balance sheet, depending on the period of the year we're in. But we want to be prudent about how we kind of step back into the sweet spot of our middle A credit ratings. Yes. So Michael, there's always something unique in the environment. I can't remember one of these calls where there wasn't a specific good guy or bad guy on the margin line we weren't talking about. And so I think what matters most is our ability to put together a P&L that hangs together great, and that always starts with sales growth. \n And so while we aren't in a position today to share a new algorithm, go forward, we'll be centered on continued sales growth and continued market share gains. And with those, I'm confident in our team's ability to put together a P&L that translates into a bottom line we'll all feel good about. Yes. We aren't getting into the specifics for gross margin or SG&A. It's all wrapped into our expectation for that OpEx line on the year. And similar to the second quarter, I expect you'll see some puts and takes. I mean one of the things we're excited about in Q2 is to get back to a more normalized level of marketing spend because we kind of had to put our foot on the hose last year as we changed course in the early stages of the pandemic. And so we feel good about returning to what I view as a really healthy level of marketing investment that should power growth in the back half of the year. You're right, Kelly, there's some seasonality to how profit flows through our P&L quarter-by-quarter, spring versus fall. We feel really good about the back half of the year and the growth we expect to deliver, and we think that yields 8% or north-of-there operating margins for the year. And so while getting too precise on any specific line, I think, would be an exercise in imprecision right now, we're really confident we'll be able to put that all together for a profit rate in the back half of the year that we feel good about."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation 2021 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 19, 2021. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. \n On the line with me today are: Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. \n In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on the first quarter and their thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. Following your remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the first quarter and his perspective on our outlook. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. \n The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growth and healing. From our unique mix of categories, to our unmatched set of fulfillment options, our business is delivering what consumers want and need each and every day. \n The results we delivered in Q1 are nothing short of outstanding. Comparable sales grew by nearly 23%, making our fourth consecutive quarter in which comp sales grew more than 20%. Maintaining that pace this quarter was especially notable, given that we were comping over double-digit growth a year ago. \n Over the last 2 years, comp sales have grown about 36%. And total sales expanded by $6.5 billion in the first quarter alone. This year's sales growth reflected more than $1 billion in market share gains, a clear signal of how relevant guests find our experience even though they have many more shopping options available compared with this time last year. \n In a quarter featuring many things to celebrate, I'm most proud of the performance of our stores. With vaccinations rolling out across the country and consumers increasingly comfortable venturing out, we've seen an enthusiastic return to in-store shopping. Guests are happy to come back to our stores because they love the environment we've created and invested in over time. \n As a result, our store comp sales increased 18% in Q1, driven almost entirely by higher traffic and accounting for the vast majority of our growth. Contrast that to a year ago when the channel mix of our business was changing rapidly, with guests leaning heavily into our digital fulfillment options, essentially our same-day services in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. \n A year ago on this call, we were highlighting a digital comp of 141%, driven by growth in our same-day services of more than 275%. These 2 contrasting scenarios clearly demonstrate the flexibility of our operating model. But they also show how our stores and digital channels complement each other to drive guest engagement. \n Even though digital stole the headlines a year ago, our store comps actually increased about 1% in the first quarter last year. And this year, while store sales accounted for most of our growth, first quarter digital comp sales also grew 50%, on top of last year's enormous numbers. This is the power of 'and'. Guests turn to Target because of our stores and our digital options, not one versus the other. And for us, the distinction between a store sale and a digital sale is largely irrelevant. \n Because of our unique stores-as-hub model, more than 3/4 of our first quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. That means, in total, more than 95% of Target's first quarter sales were driven by our store assets, store inventory and store teams. This store-driven growth is translating to outstanding bottom line performance. \n Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.69 established a new all-time high for the company. Compared to 2020 when profitability took a temporary dip, this year's performance represents an astounding increase, more than sixfold. If we look back to first quarter, this year's adjusted EPS was more than 140% higher, demonstrating how far our business has advanced in a short time. \n I want to pause here and thank our team members across the world. They have consistently demonstrated incredible passion, commitment and focus to serve our guests and take care of each other. I am grateful and proud to serve with this outstanding team and to share the incredible business results they're delivering quarter after quarter. \n It's also important to highlight how the category mix plays a key role in the flexibility of our model. For instance, with guests venturing out, we've seen an incredible rebound in apparel sales, with Q1 comp growth of more than 60%. On the other hand, and as expected, we experienced lower growth in Food, Beverages and Essentials, as we annualized the peak stock-up period a year ago. Most notably, we saw continued strength in our Home and Hardlines categories, which delivered outsized growth on top of very strong numbers a year ago. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. \n A relentless focus on operational excellence is another key factor in our performance. This is best summarized by our guest satisfaction scores, which across all of our services, have remained stable or moved higher despite record growth that's now compounding on a 2-year basis. This is a clear testament to the diligence of our team and the return on our investments in training, hours and wages over the last several years. Over those years, sales in our same-day services, order pickup, Drive-Up and ship have accounted for the bulk of our digital growth, and they grew to well over half of our digital sales in the first quarter. \n Same-day penetration has more than doubled since Q1 of 2019, when sales through these services accounted for less than 1/3 of our digital sales. While all 3 same-day services continue to grow faster than overall digital, Drive-Up has been a standout and consistently receives the highest ratings of anything we do. This service only accounted for about 5% of our first quarter digital sales 2 years ago, and that ratio expanded to more than 30% this year. \n Put another way, in the first quarter alone, Drive-Up sales have grown by well over $1 billion in the last 2 years. As John will outline in more detail, we continue to expand the assortment available for Drive-Up, and we've earmarked capital investments to make Drive-Up even more convenient for our guests and efficient for our team, given that we anticipate continued rapid growth of this service. \n While it's gratifying to see what our team has accomplished over the last several years, there is much more opportunity in front of us. We're planning significant investments in our store assets, as we remodel hundreds more locations, roll out new Ulta and Apple shopping environments, invest in the efficiency of our same-day services, and enter new neighborhood by opening new small- and medium-sized stores we're also investing in our brand portfolio, as we focus on presenting the best owned and national brands to our guests, which we highlight through the best in-store and digital shopping experience in the market. \n We're also making continued investments in safety and cleanliness, reinforcing the trust and confidence we've already established with our guests. And we continue to invest in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and advancement, to ensure that Target continues to be a destination for top talent. And as you've seen from many of our recent announcements, we're investing to leverage our size and scale, purpose and values to work for all families. \n This summer, we'll share more information about our refreshed enterprise sustainability strategy that further draws on our company legacy of corporate responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. As part of our immediate efforts, we'll focus on designing and elevating sustainable brands, innovating to eliminate waste, and accelerating opportunity and equity in all communities, all in service to a safe and prosperous future for all. \n It was 4 years ago, at the beginning of 2017, that we first announced our plan to double down on investments and growth. The decisions we announced that day and the investments we made in the intervening years left us well prepared to handle all the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic. \n In that first quarter of 2017, our business generated sales of just over $16 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.21; 4 years later, first quarter sales have grown nearly 50% and adjusted earnings per share have tripled. From today's vantage point, the opportunities ahead of us, both this year and over time, are just as bright as they were on that day 4 years ago. Despite what's already been accomplished, we've only scratched the surface of what this brand and this team can accomplish over time. I'm excited to stand with them as we write the next chapter in this great company's history. \n Now I'll turn it over to Christina, who will share more perspective on our first quarter results and for priorities going forward. Christina? \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian. As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other. That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes for our sales, both by category and in total. And so far, with one quarter behind us, results have been extremely positive across every dimension. \n In the face of this strength, we've seen an incredible response from our teams across the board, from our stores, to our merchants, to the supply chain, who've all worked together in service of our guests. While there are many ways to measure the impact of those efforts, guest loyalty and market share are the 2 most important measures of success in this volatile time. \n Consequently, it's incredibly gratifying to see that across every one of our guest segments in the first quarter, we measured an increase in average trips per guest and a larger average basket. This led to more than $1 billion of additional market share in the quarter, on top of $1 billion gain a year ago. \n In terms of category performance, we saw the strongest growth in our Apparel business, which delivered comp growth in the low 60% range. As Brian mentioned, we saw a temporary dip in apparel sales last year, when first quarter comps were down around 20%. Following this year's strong increase, first quarter apparel sales have grown approximately 29% over the last 2 years. \n Home also delivered incredible growth with an increase in the mid-30% range, on top of a high single-digit increase a year ago. Within Home, growth was strong across the board, with the most robust performance in our decorative home and seasonal businesses. \n Hardlines also delivered huge volume, with comp growth above 30%, on top of a 20% increase a year ago. Results were led by sporting goods and toys, which both saw comps above 40%. \n Beauty comp in the high teens, on top of a high single-digit growth a year ago. Within Beauty, the skin care, sun care and bath categories delivered comp growth in the mid-30% range, with cosmetics growing in the low 20s. \n Finally, our Essentials and Food categories both delivered comps in the low to mid-single digits. To see healthy growth on top of last year is remarkable as you'll recall that a year ago, guests were aggressively stocking up their pantries, fridges and freezers, and we sold virtually every unit of paper goods that we owned. \n Beyond category strength, I want to pause and also highlight that sales on Target's own brands grew approximately 36% in the first quarter, the strongest increase we've ever recorded. Because of our unique capabilities in product design, development and sourcing, our own brand products offer an unbeatable combination of design, quality and value. These brands aren't something that our guests pick up while they're at Target, they're a big reason why they shop at Target, which is why we continue to invest in them. \n We frequently talk about performance by category and our brands because it's important that our entire portfolio is healthy and well positioned to meet our guest needs. But it's also important to realize that they create value for our guests beyond simply the sum of the parts. Rather, it's the combination of all our offerings, including categories, brands and services across our distinct multichannel experience, that allows Target to serve our guest needs today and over time. \n Last year, as guests focused more on enjoying time at home, that had implications not just for our Home category, but also for Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Essentials. And their focus on health and well-being affected trends in activewear, Beauty, health care, Food & Beverage and more. \n The same is true for our sales channels. As guests last year focused on social distancing, they leaned into digital, including our same-day services. And this year, as they're looking to get back out in public, they're flocking to our stores, based on the trust we established over time, which was further reinforced by last year's investments. \n So as we plan the remainder of the year, both in total and by category, we continue to listen closely to our guests to understand how they're thinking and feeling. And when we talk to our guests today, they tell us they want to maintain some of the new habits and routines they formed during the pandemic, including an enhanced focus on the joy of home and health and well-being of their family. \n At the same time, there's a rapidly emerging emphasis on style and mobility as guests feel increasingly safe in public spaces. That trend is playing out in an explosive demand for dresses and cosmetics as well as luggage and categories based on being active like sporting goods and Performance Activewear. This reinforces the concept of 'and'. Target can fulfill our guests' needs as they focus on home and health and when they look to venture out. We can welcome them back into our stores and continue to serve them with the same-day services they've recently tried and now love. \n So after a record-setting first quarter, we're keeping our foot on the gas, based on our guests' desire to bring rejuvenated life and energy to their homes, celebrate seasonal moments with loved ones and step out in public. I could not be more excited about the ways we're ready to inspire and energize our guests. \n Just last week, we launched our latest limited-time collection, Hilton Carter for Target. Off to a great start, this collection features live plants, foe greenery and unique plant accessories for experienced and novice gardeners alike. Not to be outdone by their parents, younger kids want to make their spaces their own. And our popular kids brand, Pillowfort, will continue to help them do just that. For its 5-year anniversary, Pillowfort is celebrating with hundreds of new items that can grow with them and be used in any area of the house. \n As our guests begin stepping out, they're focused on looking and feeling their best. With this rekindled passion for fashion, our guests will be overjoyed with the latest installment of our designer dress collection. Featuring designs by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo, this assortment offers more than 70 original and affordable dresses in bold, bright patterns and statement silhouettes. And of course, with our continual focus on inclusivity and celebrating everybody, this collection features affordable prices in a range of sizes from XXS to 4X.\n We've long focused on making Target a destination for holidays and life events, and we just wrapped up a huge Mother's Day season. We had solutions for mom across the store, from apparel, gifting, beauty, flowers, candy and more. And now we're gearing up for Father's Day in June. We've got a great assortment of gifts for dad, from All in Motion attire for golfing, hitting the gym or just hanging out, to a line of shave, skin care and hair care products from Goodfellow.\n Of course, June celebrations aren't exclusive to dad. With so many in-person celebrations canceled last year, we're ecstatic about our fabulous new assortment for Pride as we celebrate love with our LGBTQIA guests, team members and neighbors. \n Later in the summer, we know families are excited to celebrate the 4th of July with a long-awaited neighborhood cookout, a road trip out of town or an intimate backyard barbecue with a few fireworks. With great deals and the perfect owned and national brand assortments, it doesn't matter if the celebration is big or small, Target is everything you'll need to fill a cooler, pack a beach bag and fill up with friends, family and fun. \n And before we know it, it's time to head back to school, and we're planning for one of our biggest back-to-school and college seasons ever. Of course, we'll have great deals on all the traditional school supplies, but we'll also have the new normals on the school supply list, like hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. \n With local school lists on target.com and our industry-leading fulfillment options, back-to-school shopping has never been safer or easier. And with the great new apparel offerings from Cat & Jack, Art Class, More than Magic, Wild Fable, Original Use and All in Motion, all found only at Target, we'll have our school-bound guests looking and feeling fresh for that first day of school. \n Before I close, I want to pause and highlight some of the work I'm most passionate about, and that's our work on Target's REACH Committee, which we formed last year to achieve lasting systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities. This work aligns with our vision for sustainability at Target, and it's a strong example of how we're becoming an equitable company, creating change that strengthens our business. \n Hopefully, you've seen our recent announcement that Target is committed to spending more than $2 billion with black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. In addition, we've announced a new scholarship program to support students and more than a dozen historically black colleges and universities. And this summer, both in-store and online, we are adding more items to our Black Beyond Measure assortment. I'm so proud of these efforts and everything we do to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. \n I also want to give a quick shout out to our store teams. I recently had a chance to visit stores in the New York City market. And after more than a year in which most of my meetings have been virtual, it was an incredibly energizing experience. I visited new small-format locations across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn. Every location was a unique reflection of the local neighborhood, from design, to assortment and the team members serving their neighbors. Based on the energy and passion I could feel from these teams, it's clear why we're seeing such strong sales in our stores across the country. \n As the first Chief Growth Officer at Target, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunities still ahead of us. As you saw throughout 2020 and now in 2021, we have a long runway to continue investing in and growing our core business. At the same time, we'll continue to develop innovation pipelines and explore new initiatives, maintaining a balance between fundamentals and execution and the exploration of new opportunities. As we plan for future growth, we'll continue to listen to our guests and apply those insights to prioritize their work. With this guest-first approach, we're confident we can continue to build relevance and market share, both today and over time. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5 billion of sales in the first quarter. Given this continued rapid growth and the opportunities still ahead of us, the operations team is focused on building capacity and enhancing processes to create and enable Target's continued growth. \n That work starts in our supply chain, where we've outlined our plans to add 4 new regional distribution centers by the end of 2022, with the first 2 buildings slated to open later this year. These new buildings located in Chicago and New Jersey are set to go live in the next several months, creating additional capacity for the network in total, while enhancing service levels in high-volume markets that continue to grow. More specifically, once these buildings are operating at scale, they'll meaningfully shorten lead times to nearby stores, improving in-stock levels, while reducing the need for safety stock in those locations. \n Beyond the capacity we're adding with these new buildings, we're also investing in updated fixtures to create additional capacity across our current network. These changes are highly capital efficient, involving a small amount of capital to open up a substantial amount of incremental capacity within the network, equivalent to the addition of about 1.5 new distribution centers. \n And as we told you at our meeting in March, we're pleased with the initial results from our new sortation center in Minneapolis. As a result, we have plans to build up to 5 more of these facilities in 2021, with additional openings planned for 2022 and beyond. We're opening these centers, which are smaller than an average store in markets with a high concentration of local package delivery. They're designed to receive and sort packages from a large group of surrounding stores multiple times a day, which allows for more optimized granular sortation. This precision reduces costs for our delivery partners, meaningfully reducing what we pay for delivery. In addition, these facilities eliminate the need for sortation with the stores they serve, while freeing up packing capacity at those same locations. \n Sort centers have long been on our fulfillment road map, which we've built through internal development along with small acquisitions. In these facilities, we optimize the selection of delivery partners by applying technology from Grand Junction, which we acquired in 2017. And we optimize sortation to minimize costs to increase speed by applying technology we acquired from Deliv in 2020. \n In addition, beginning in the first quarter, our Minneapolis sort center began testing package delivery using Shipt, another 2017 acquisition, to add capacity, reduce costs and enable more, flexibility, which will benefit our rapidly growing ship-from-store capability over time. \n Within our store network, we've begun ramping up our remodel program, following the pause we implemented last year. We have just over 34 remodels slated for completion in the second quarter and more than 100 planned for the back half of the year. Based on past experience, we expect these remodeled stores will generate an incremental 2% to 4% sales growth in the year following completion, with another 2% incremental growth in the second year. \n Beyond the direct impact on sales, these transformations create an ideal platform for all of the merchandise innovations and service enhancements that we'll launch over time. In addition to full store remodels, we're planning other store investments this year, including more than 100 Ulta shop-in-shops slated to launch in the back half of the year, as well as our enhanced Apple layout in Electronics in select stores across the country. \n Among our store services, we've long known that our same-day fulfillment options would be popular with our guests. But their growth over the last few years has been far above our expectations. This is most evident in our Drive-Up service where first quarter sales volume was nearly 21x higher than it was 2 years ago, amounting to nearly $1.3 billion of incremental sales volume over that period. \n In the face of this incredible growth, there are emerging opportunities in high-volume locations to invest in capacity and efficiency in support of our same-day services. Specifically, in more than 100 locations this year, we're investing in small projects to optimize the front ends of these buildings, freeing up additional capacity for continued same-day growth, while making the layout more efficient and safer for the team. \n We also continue to enhance the assortments available for all 3 same-day services, adding more perishable food to our pickup and Drive-Up services and more general merchandise like apparel to the assortment available through Shipt. And we just announced that in the second quarter, we'll have adult beverages available through pickup and/or Drive-Up in more than 1,200 stores and available for same-day delivery in more than 600 stores across the country. \n Beyond activity in existing stores, we're expanding our new store opening plans to more than 30 additional locations across the country this year, as we continue to find compelling opportunities in urban and dense suburban markets and on our near-college campuses. In recent years, these custom formats have typically been less than 50,000 square feet. However, given local real estate conditions in dense suburban markets, we're also finding compelling opportunities to open somewhat bigger stores, between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, which weren't available in the past. As a group, these new stores are generating higher-than-average sales productivity, above average gross margin rates and strong financial returns, and we see a very long runway to open more of them over time. \n And finally, after store comp growth of 18% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by traffic, we're confident that we're already benefiting from a differentiated service model in our stores. But that's a lead we can't take for granted. So we're continually looking for ways to get even better. So this year, our store teams are rolling out an enhanced service model, focused on consistency of every interaction to ensure that our guests will always feel welcomed and appreciated. And if they need help, there will be team members who can find solutions to enhance their experience. \n This new engagement model is strongly connected to our company purpose, culture and values. And we're supporting it with enhanced training and tools across the chain. It's designed not to be a one-and-done effort, but a sustainable model that's integrated with our operational goals, not something separate that's added on to everyday tasks. \n So as I turn it over to Michael, I want to once again thank the entire team for the incredible things you've already done and your passion to continually raise the bar. This year, I'm celebrating my 25th year at Target, so you might be tempted to think I've seen it all. But when I step back and realize what this team has accomplished in the last year under the most challenging of circumstances, it's clear that there is no limit to this team's potential, and there's no doubt that we have the best team in retail. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. \n On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more than offset all of the unique headwinds we faced over this challenging period, resulting in really strong performance. Target's total sales grew 23.3% in the first quarter, reflecting comp growth of 22.9%. Given last year's double-digit growth, first quarter sales have expanded more than 37% over the last 2 years, driven almost entirely by higher comps. Unlike last year, when consumers were consolidating trips and shopping less often, this year's comp growth was driven primarily by a traffic increase of more than 17% combined with a 5% increase in average ticket. \n As Brian mentioned, store comps were the growth engine this year, while digital was the primary driver in Q1 2020. As such, over the last 2 years, both our stores and digital channels have expanded their first quarter sales by more than $3 billion. This balance highlights the relevance and complementary nature of both channels in serving our guest needs. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate of 30% was 490 basis points ahead of last year when we faced a number of temporary headwinds, including markdowns and other costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. Compared with 2019, this year's first quarter gross margin rate was about 40 basis points higher, which is notable given that digital sales penetration more than doubled in that time, from 7.1% in 2019 to more than 18% this year. \n In terms of the year-over-year gross margin drivers, mix had a positive impact of about 150 basis points, reflecting the dramatic increase in apparel sales and continued strength in our home category. The remaining favorability was driven by core merchandising, as we continued to benefit from low promotional and clearance markdown rates, and we annualized last year's costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. The rate impact of supply chain and digital fulfillment costs was approximately neutral compared to last year, as the costs of outsized digital growth were offset by the benefit of a stronger mix of same-day fulfillment and our ongoing work to control unit costs across our entire suite of digital fulfillment options. \n Our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 18.6% this year, down more than 2 percentage points from 20.7% a year ago and 20.8% in 2019. In terms of drivers, leverage benefits have more than offset all of the extra costs we've absorbed over the last 2 years, including meaningfully higher pay and benefits for our team and other investments to protect the health and safety of our team and guests. \n While D&A expenses have grown in each of the last 2 years, this year's first quarter D&A expense rate was about 40 basis points lower than a year ago and about 80 basis points lower than 2019. \n Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate increased an astounding 7.4 percentage points compared with a year ago to an unprecedented 9.8% this year, from a temporary low of 2.4% rate a year ago. However, even compared to a very healthy 6.4% operating margin rate in the first quarter of 2019, this year's rate was more than 3 percentage points higher. In terms of dollars, first quarter operating income has more than doubled over the last 2 years. \n On the bottom line, our business delivered first quarter GAAP EPS of $4.17, up more than 600% from a year ago and well over double our 2019 GAAP EPS. On the adjusted EPS line, which excluded the gain from the sale of our DermStore business, we earned $3.69 this year, more than 500% higher than a year ago and well over double our 2019 adjusted EPS. \n As you know, our capital deployment priorities remain the same as they've been for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we returned cash through our quarterly dividend, which we've maintained every quarter as a public company and grown every year since 1971. And finally, we returned excess cash over time through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A debt ratings. \n In the first quarter, we invested just over $0.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our business. We continue to expect our full year CapEx will be approximately $4 billion, but the bulk of those expenditures will be more backloaded in the year, given the timing of this year's projects. \n We paid dividends of $340 million in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago, as growth in the per share dividend was partially offset by a decline in share count. And finally, we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, following a temporary pause in 2020, and deployed about $1.2 billion to retire 6.1 million shares at an average share price of just under $191. And in February, we completed the sale of our DermStore business, which contributed just over $350 million to our first quarter cash flow. \n Altogether, we ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. This was down about $700 million from the beginning of the quarter, but still well above where we expect to operate over time. With this cash, we'll be funding approximately $3.5 billion of additional CapEx in 2021 and we'll be recommending a robust increase in our quarterly dividends to the Board later this year. Beyond these uses, we should have ample capacity for continued share repurchases, and we'll continue to govern the magnitude and pace of repurchases in support of our goal to maintain our Middle A credit ratings. And given where we are today, it will likely be a multiyear journey before our debt metrics move fully back to where they've been over time. \n Now I'd like to turn briefly to our return on invested capital, which reflects both our operating results and the investments we've made to generate them. In the first quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC moved up to 30.7%, which is well over double the 13.4% we reported a year ago. While we've indicated that this measure will likely be volatile in the near term and could revert to a very healthy number, near 20% over time, the fact that our business has generated such a high after-tax return over the last 12 months is a testament both to the strength of our model and outstanding execution by our team. \n Now let me turn to our sales outlook. We learned a lot in the first quarter, and notably, got our first look at how our business is successfully comping the comp, with impressive growth on top of last year's strong surge in sales. Also, and importantly, we've continued to gain market share on top of last year's dramatic share gains. Based on these results, we're now planning for our business to deliver a mid- to high single-digit comp increase in the second quarter. This expectation is in line with the 2-year growth rates we saw in the first quarter. \n And while we only have a couple of weeks in the quarter behind us, the results we've seen so far this month are consistent with this outlook. The range for second quarter operating income remains wide, but should remain strong, far ahead of our 2019 rate of 7.2%, but perhaps not fully as high as last year's unprecedented rate of 10%. \n In terms of the specific puts and takes in the quarter, we'll be comping over last year's reversal of the return reserve estimate, which added about $110 million to last year's operating income. In addition, this year, we're making purposeful investments in store labor hours to ensure we deliver outstanding service and stronger in-stocks than a year ago, when sales grew far beyond our expectations. Of course, we'll continue to benefit from meaningful sales leverage, given that we're planning for healthy growth on top of last year's record-setting increase. Putting that all together, we expect to see continued strong performance on this line. \n In the back half of the year, the range of possibilities for comp growth is also quite wide, and we'll gain more insights as the year progresses. As of today, based on our recent results and confidence going forward, we expect to see positive single-digit comps in the back half of the year, on top of last year's unprecedented performance. \n Regarding our full year operating margin rate, following an exceptionally strong first quarter, we have increasing confidence in the consumer and industry backdrop in the back half of the year. As such, the range of outcomes for our 2021 operating margin rate has moved significantly higher. So despite the anticipated headwind from higher markdown rates following last year's historically low rates, we believe that our business is positioned to deliver a full year operating margin rate that's well over last year's rate of 7%. More specifically, we believe this year's operating margin rate could reach 8% or perhaps a little higher. We'll continue to refine our view throughout the year. \n As the team looks ahead to the rest of the year, they're focused on staying agile in what continues to be a volatile environment. Rather than placing all of their bets on a single forecast number, they're focused on contingency planning, creating flexibility that will allow us to react to unexpected changes, and importantly, take advantage of opportunity when we see it. \n We're also excited about the investments still ahead of us and the growth they'll create: hundreds more remodels; dozens of new stores; new Ulta and Apple shopping environments; and supply chain investments to support both replenishment and fulfillment. Given the performance we're seeing today, which is the product of the investments we've made over the last few years, we're eagerly leading into future opportunities to enable more profitable, high-return growth over time. \n Before I turn it back over to Brian, I want to add my voice and thanks to the team. The value our team members are creating for our business, communities, shareholders and each other goes far beyond what we can measure in a P&L. Thanks for making Target an even stronger company on behalf of all of our stakeholders. \n Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Before we move to your questions, I want to pause and acknowledge again the role our team plays in the outstanding results we delivered this quarter. I'm thankful for their continued focus on our guests, focus on operational excellence and passion for our brand. \n I also want to acknowledge the challenges facing our India headquarter team, along with our team members who have family there, given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. We have been carefully monitoring conditions on the ground and providing extra support to our team during this difficult time to ensure they can take care of themselves and their families. We've also funded $500,000 donation to UNICEF set to increase access to option treatment in hospitals across the country and bring testing resources to the hardest hit communities. We're hopeful that conditions there will continue to improve. \n So now as we get ready to move to your questions, I want to underscore the confidence you've heard throughout our remarks today. Coming off an unbelievable year in 2020, we had a lot of confidence as we entered 2021, but our first quarter results came in far ahead of our baseline expectations. \n With the macro and consumer backdrop that's been surprisingly positive, we've seen remarkable momentum in our performance, even as we started to comp over the period of peak increases a year ago. The flexibility of our category mix and fulfillment options, combined with an agile, energetic and engaged team, continue to resonate with our guests, driving double-digit traffic growth and an increase in average tickets in the first quarter. \n But as you've often heard me say, we shouldn't confuse performance with potential. So even after more than a year of unprecedented growth, we're seeing focus and leaning into the opportunities ahead of us, making investments to build on an already strong foundation. With these investments, I'm confident that our business model and outstanding team will continue to raise the bar on an already best-in-class retail experience, resulting in even stronger loyalty and guest engagement over time. \n With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Congratulations. Great job, Brian. The question that I have is when you look at the mix of -- especially on the apparel side, can you talk about any new brands that you're excited about? You've done a great job with the private brand piece. And I think as you move through the year, any expectations that you have just on that mix and some of the margin implications around that category would be great. \nBrian Cornell: Well, why don't I let Christina spend some time talking about what we're seeing with categories, some of the highlights between our own brands and national brands. Obviously, Christina highlighted the fact that despite our overall robust performance in the quarter, owned brands grew by 36%, a record performance for us. So we're clearly seeing great performance in both our own brands and national brands. \n But Christina, why don't you build on some of what we're seeing in the different categories? \nA. Hennington: Absolutely. Bob, thanks for the question. As Brian was just sharing, we really are excited about the strength across the board. Apparel was certainly a stand out in this quarter with growing over 60%, and that came from a range of brands in every segment of the business. \n But the reality is the 3 trends that I talked about in my prepared remarks are benefiting our multi-category approach across the board: joy at Home and the opportunity to celebrate everything that brings the guests to their home, eating, being with their families, and the investments that they've made over time in their home; health and well-being, the opportunities that our guests are taking to invest in proactive health care and fitness at home and activewear. \n And then the newer and more emerging trend is really style and mobility. As guests are going out, they are looking for a fresh look. So our newest collections of dresses by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo couldn't have been more perfectly timed to really help guests look their best in what they're wearing and certainly also across their beauty trends. \nOperator: And the next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Outstanding results. Congratulations to the team. I guess my question is on, first, same-day services, which obviously continues to really showcase robust growth. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about how the business has evolved. What are the additional learnings? And what are the actions that have been taken to really improve efficiency and profitability of that particular business and service? \nBrian Cornell: Well, Paul, thanks again for joining us this morning. Why don't we let John Mulligan talk about some of the progress we've made from a same-day fulfillment standpoint. \nJohn Mulligan: Paul, it's good to talk to you. As you know well, we've talked about stores as hubs now for going on 4 years. And we have always said, we like it for a couple of reasons: One, great guest service; and two, better economics. Same-day services are that on steroids. They have much better economics than shipping something to someone's home because, as we've talked about, the shipping expense is the biggest part of delivering something to someone's home. So if we take that out of the equation, then we end up with economics that are much closer to the store transaction. \n The thing we love about all of the same-day services, pick up, Drive-Up and ship, all of them continue to grow faster than our overall digital growth, and we continue to find ways to improve them, as you said. Part of that is investing in technology for our teams, improving their sort paths and improving how they pick. We've done a great deal of process work to break things apart, to make it simpler for our teams to execute. We've done things to help them find items in the store so that we don't end up with what we call, INFs, or items not found. \n And then we continue to invest in helping them physically. And that's a big focus for us this year and will be over the next couple of years. In the case of Drive-Up, which as we've talked about a couple of times, Brian talked about and I talked about, has been our fastest-growing same-day service since -- basically since we started it. It also has our highest NPS score, so guests love it. We let you decide when you want to come. We don't force you into a time slot. And then our team brings it out to you in 2 minutes or less. So our guests absolutely love that. And you'll see us invest in making that easier for our team, building capacity on the front end of the store. \n Over the past year, we've rolled out adding temperature control products to Drive-Up. And so you'll see us have refrigeration and freezers to the front end of the store, all behind the wall so that our guests don't see that, but making it much easier for our teams to execute. And then much safer, we'll make it much easier for them to walk out to cars, protect them from the environment a little bit. So all of that experience continues to improve as well. \n So every year, our team comes up with multiple ways to continue to improve the service, first and foremost, for the guest, and then on the back end, improve things for our team so they can execute it easier as we continue to grow. So we see a lot more opportunity for us. And as I said, that will be a big part of our capital investment over the next several years. \nBrian Cornell: John, the only thing I might add is as we saw our guests turn to same-day services during the pandemic using pickup and Drive-Up and ship, we expect those services to be very sticky over time. And certainly, I think we've matured the awareness and the use of those same-day services by 2, 3, if not 4 years. And certainly, as we go into the back half of the year and during the holiday season, I think we're going to continue to see our guests turn to ship and Drive-Up and pick up. That's just an easy and convenient way to shop at Target. \nPaul Trussell: Just a quick follow-up for Michael. Obviously, you're really showcasing a lot of confidence in the trajectory of the business, given the outlook provided for the balance of the year. Maybe just a little bit more detail on how we should think about gross margins and SG&A for what's clearly going to be a really healthy operating margin rate in 2Q and the second half. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Sure, Paul. Thanks for the question. And I touched on this a bit in my remarks, but if I had to summarize our profit story, it goes back to the scale benefits we see when we have growth. And our plan for the back part of the year is to see growth on top of some of the strongest quarters in Target's history last year. So we would expect that leave to -- to lead to improving profit rates on a year-over-year basis. And there's still a wide range of where those numbers might ultimately land, and we'll continue to refine our point of view as the year progresses. But scale is a wonderful thing. And we've seen impressive growth over last year, and we expect more to come in the balance of this year. \nOperator: The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I'll add my congratulations to a great quarter. I wanted to just ask a little bit about share gains. And obviously, we know the categories, and you're gaining share across all categories. But I wanted to see if you could give a little bit more color on share gains by demographic, and which demographics you think you're gaining the most share from. And then I had a follow-up to that last question that was asked. \nBrian Cornell: Karen, thanks again for joining us today. And I appreciate the question on market share. As you look at our business, and I think you know our Target guests and our Target shopper, we're appealing to all demographics. And we've had over -- now well over 30 million guests who shop us every week. Most of America shops at Target. And I think as we look at it, we're picking up share across all these various cohorts. So it's not one consumer, it's all of the guests who are shopping Target and as they return to our stores, shopping multiple categories. \n And I think that's the magic behind our performance, is that great combination of in-store experience, the ease and convenience of digital, but that multi-category portfolio and that unique combination of our own brands and curated national brands, we appeal to a broad group of consumers in different cohorts. And we're picking up share across all of these different areas. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then just on inventory growth. Obviously, your inventory growth was very strong this quarter, which is impressive given the freight issues, but -- and the port issues. But maybe some color on that growth in general, and how you think about the balance of actually wanting more markdowns in 2021 versus 2020, and how we should think about that in the context gross margin? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, why don't you start? And then we can provide some additional color as Christina talks about our inventory positions. \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. Well, first off, Karen, we feel really good about our inventory position heading into the second quarter. And you can see we're up on a year-over-year basis, and we should be given the growth in sales that we've seen and continue to expect. \n When it comes to markdowns through the balance of the year, we've talked about this a little bit previously, we were sold through in a lot of seasons last year, and that's not optimal for us. We don't want to look at empty shelves at the end of a seasonal set. And so with our anticipation for growth in the remainder of this year, we'll be buying appropriately to that. And hopefully, that means we've got fuller shelves at the end of a season. And with that, will come some clearance markdowns, there will be a little bit of a drag on markdown rates on a year-over-year basis if I had to guess. But I would welcome a little bit of that rate drag because it means that we're full and in stock for the guests throughout the season. \nOperator: The next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So a couple of questions on guidance. My first question is, in the second quarter, Michael, why couldn't you reach 10% or at least be close to that? You did a 9.8% in 1Q. Sales volumes look to be similar. Is it less rich mix performance? Or perhaps you're putting in some caution around potential promotions and clearance? \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Well, we would expect, like I said in my remarks, the second quarter to be far ahead of the 2-year ago performance, likely not as high as last year. But there's still a broad range around that outcome. And so we'll see as the quarter plays out exactly where we land. \n Worth noting, and I touched on this as well, there's some factors unique to the quarter. We've got a $110 million headwind from the way our returns reserve calendarizes between Q1 and Q2. And the second thing is, we're investing, and we'll continue to invest in the team and in-store payroll to make sure we're staffed and in stock to support the sales we expect to come. And our teams have done just an incredible job this year providing such great guest experience. And we want to make sure we're investing to continue to support that and to support growth. \nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then as you think about the gross margin, can you talk about the puts and takes of this year versus 2019? Obviously, you have a higher e-commerce mix. But you would think that sort of the mix of the business by category could be richer. And you also have pretty lean inventories against a strong demand backdrop. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. So maybe I'll speak to actuals and unpack the first quarter just a little bit versus 2 years ago. If you look at kind of versus our 2019 performance, we saw markdown efficiency. And we've talked about that, lower levels of promotional and clearance markdown rates in 2019. On a 2-year basis, mix is actually about 40 basis points of a drag in the first quarter. And also, on a 2-year basis, you can see digital and supply chain pressure of a shade over 1 point given the growth in the digital business and the impact that, that has to rate. And so those are familiar drivers we've talked about over time. Where those drivers land for the balance of the year will dictate where margin ultimately falls. \nOperator: The next question is from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: I wanted to go into labor. Brian, I heard your comments today on CNBC about that it's kind of -- you're not really having a struggle getting labor. And I also heard you guys talk about enhanced service model. So I was wondering if you could talk about whether you guys believe you have a labor advantage and kind of what you're doing with your labor force to enhance the store experience. \nBrian Cornell: Well, Scott, thanks for joining us. Why don't I start and then I'll let John build on my comments. \n But as I said earlier today, we've been investing in our team for many years now. And we took an industry-leading position with our starting minimum wage. We've continued to invest over the last year in the health and wellness and safety of our teams. And I think that's allowed us to build even deeper engagement with our teams and stores and our teams and supply chain. \n So I do think it gives us a competitive advantage. And I think the focus we place on our team, the care of our team, making sure we're investing in their training, their development, their growth, I think that's really provided us with a unique experience. And I think it's one of our competitive advantages in the marketplace. \n John? \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Scott, just building on what Brian said. Basically, I think our thought has always been, the best way to staff our stores and our supply chain, frankly, is to limit turnover. And so let's invest in our team, give them a great experience. And you've seen us do that for several years now. We've invested in wages. We've invested in benefits. Just as importantly, we've invested in training to help upskill them. And then over the course of the past 1.5 years or so, we've invested in safety very overtly. \n And so as Brian said, engagement is very high. Turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store's at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, right? We get team members that know their jobs. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores because they're in there weekly. They can engage with them. And this kind of gets to the service model where the idea is to engage with our guests, make them feel welcomed, and importantly, solve their problem. If they have an issue, solve it in the moment for them. \n And so you'll see us continue to do that. We're very encouraged by what we see. Our NPS scores across all of our services, including the in-store experience, are up over last year and up over 2019. So we're just getting started on this journey, but the early results are very encouraging. And I would just finish where Brian did. We -- you've heard us say for a long time, we have the best team in retail, and we absolutely believe that's the truth. \nBrian Cornell: John and I had a review just yesterday with our store team leaders who look at turnover and retention rates, and we just continue to see stronger and stronger numbers. And back to the point that John had made. So the operating model changes we've made over the last few years, putting experts in place in areas like beauty and technology, those team members are really passionate about the work that they do, and they continue to learn and grow every day. And I think that focus on providing training and development opportunities, the expertise that we're providing in those key categories, that's going to continue to provide benefits to us over time. \nOperator: The next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if I could go back to the digital fulfillment questions that were asked earlier. I think you said costs were neutral. And I wondered, is it possible for how you're fulfilling to turn into a tailwind as you continue to drive more growth towards the same-day services and away from 2-day free ship? \n And then separately, you mentioned the sortation centers and the number you're opening this year. I wondered if you could talk to just the cost optimization from those sortation centers over the long term. \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. Thanks for the question, Kate. I can start, and then maybe John can provide more color on the sortation center work that we're doing. We didn't see pressure on the supply chain and digital line this quarter. That's due in part to the just incredible strength in our store business, with stores up 18% on a year-over-year basis. \n I get excited by the efficiency improvements I see us continue to make in our digital experience. John talked to some of those just a minute ago. But we can do a lot with the volumes that we've built over the last 2 years in some of those same-day services. And all of that volume translates to more efficiency opportunity as we can continue to squeeze down the per unit cost to fulfill. \n But I don't shy away from growth -- or from a drag on that line from a growing digital business. And the reason why is, when guests lean into digital, when we get more omnichannel guests, more guests using Drive-Up, more guests using same-day, even if that sale itself comes at a slightly lower rate, it does incredible things for the rest of our P&L because we see those guests spend more in total, about 30% more for a new Drive-Up or Shipt guest. And that's way more important than the little bit of rate drag we've seen over time from digital growth, and that's how we continue to think about it. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. And on the sort centers, Kate, we remain pretty excited about this opportunity, but I would caution you that it's early days for us still. We're -- we always talk about crawl, walk, run. I'd say we're still firmly in crawl here in Minneapolis. And so we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. But the play here is a couple of things. \n And first of all, it's about capacity in the stores. So if we can sweep packages out of the stores more routinely than once a day, that frees up space, and that frees up space for us to pack additional products in the store. And that's an important thing for us. Then as we move downstream, the more granular sort is where we start to see potentially cost reductions as we can sort to provide to our carrier partners further downstream in their operations. And like we'd announced about a month ago, using the Deliv technology, creating local routes for local packages, we can get very efficient on delivery using Shipt and Shipt drivers. And so put all that together and our guest gets a great experience, we create more capacity. And we have the opportunity to continue to improve what we believe are already advantaged economics because of our stores-as-hub model. So more to come on all that. It's early days, but we remain pretty optimistic on all 3 of those fronts. \nOperator: Our last question is from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I wanted to ask you. You touched on it a little bit, I think, Christina, in the prepared remarks about back-to-school and being excited. And assuming we do have a more normal back-to-school and with this child tax credit coming, are you guys planning the back-to-school period in the second half any differently this year in terms of marketing or inventory levels maybe that you could share a little bit with us? \nA. Hennington: Yes. Joe, I'd be happy to talk about that. So we're very excited about what these life moments afford us in the back half. The opportunity for a little more \"normalcy,\" it really creates opportunities for us to be relevant with our guests in many different ways. \n And so you think about back-to-school as a huge moment where the convenience of our assortment across a multi-category portfolio is already a preferred destination. But then you think about how that leads into opportunities in Halloween and Thanksgiving and the holidays, opportunities for our families to be together and celebrate, sometimes for the first time in almost 2 years. And so this is where the power of our assortment, and the gifting opportunities, the value equation that we offer and the resonance with our brand really shine. And so that means we're very excited about what the full outlook will be. \nBrian Cornell: So Joe, thanks for that final question. It's a great place for us to wrap up. And hopefully, for all of you, you recognize the confidence we have in our business as we go forward, the execution that we're seeing across all of our different functions and the way we're focused on serving the guests. \n So I appreciate everyone joining us today. And operator, that concludes our first quarter earnings call. So thanks again for joining us.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we detailed how last year's $15 billion in sales growth was more than we grew over the prior 11 years. And as you've seen today, trends are not slowing down, as we added another $4.5 billion of sales in the first quarter. Given this continued rapid growth and the opportunities still ahead of us, the operations team is focused on building capacity and enhancing processes to create and enable Target's continued growth. \n That work starts in our supply chain, where we've outlined our plans to add 4 new regional distribution centers by the end of 2022, with the first 2 buildings slated to open later this year. These new buildings located in Chicago and New Jersey are set to go live in the next several months, creating additional capacity for the network in total, while enhancing service levels in high-volume markets that continue to grow. More specifically, once these buildings are operating at scale, they'll meaningfully shorten lead times to nearby stores, improving in-stock levels, while reducing the need for safety stock in those locations. \n Beyond the capacity we're adding with these new buildings, we're also investing in updated fixtures to create additional capacity across our current network. These changes are highly capital efficient, involving a small amount of capital to open up a substantial amount of incremental capacity within the network, equivalent to the addition of about 1.5 new distribution centers. \n And as we told you at our meeting in March, we're pleased with the initial results from our new sortation center in Minneapolis. As a result, we have plans to build up to 5 more of these facilities in 2021, with additional openings planned for 2022 and beyond. We're opening these centers, which are smaller than an average store in markets with a high concentration of local package delivery. They're designed to receive and sort packages from a large group of surrounding stores multiple times a day, which allows for more optimized granular sortation. This precision reduces costs for our delivery partners, meaningfully reducing what we pay for delivery. In addition, these facilities eliminate the need for sortation with the stores they serve, while freeing up packing capacity at those same locations. \n Sort centers have long been on our fulfillment road map, which we've built through internal development along with small acquisitions. In these facilities, we optimize the selection of delivery partners by applying technology from Grand Junction, which we acquired in 2017. And we optimize sortation to minimize costs to increase speed by applying technology we acquired from Deliv in 2020. \n In addition, beginning in the first quarter, our Minneapolis sort center began testing package delivery using Shipt, another 2017 acquisition, to add capacity, reduce costs and enable more, flexibility, which will benefit our rapidly growing ship-from-store capability over time. \n Within our store network, we've begun ramping up our remodel program, following the pause we implemented last year. We have just over 34 remodels slated for completion in the second quarter and more than 100 planned for the back half of the year. Based on past experience, we expect these remodeled stores will generate an incremental 2% to 4% sales growth in the year following completion, with another 2% incremental growth in the second year. \n Beyond the direct impact on sales, these transformations create an ideal platform for all of the merchandise innovations and service enhancements that we'll launch over time. In addition to full store remodels, we're planning other store investments this year, including more than 100 Ulta shop-in-shops slated to launch in the back half of the year, as well as our enhanced Apple layout in Electronics in select stores across the country. \n Among our store services, we've long known that our same-day fulfillment options would be popular with our guests. But their growth over the last few years has been far above our expectations. This is most evident in our Drive-Up service where first quarter sales volume was nearly 21x higher than it was 2 years ago, amounting to nearly $1.3 billion of incremental sales volume over that period. \n In the face of this incredible growth, there are emerging opportunities in high-volume locations to invest in capacity and efficiency in support of our same-day services. Specifically, in more than 100 locations this year, we're investing in small projects to optimize the front ends of these buildings, freeing up additional capacity for continued same-day growth, while making the layout more efficient and safer for the team. \n We also continue to enhance the assortments available for all 3 same-day services, adding more perishable food to our pickup and Drive-Up services and more general merchandise like apparel to the assortment available through Shipt. And we just announced that in the second quarter, we'll have adult beverages available through pickup and/or Drive-Up in more than 1,200 stores and available for same-day delivery in more than 600 stores across the country. \n Beyond activity in existing stores, we're expanding our new store opening plans to more than 30 additional locations across the country this year, as we continue to find compelling opportunities in urban and dense suburban markets and on our near-college campuses. In recent years, these custom formats have typically been less than 50,000 square feet. However, given local real estate conditions in dense suburban markets, we're also finding compelling opportunities to open somewhat bigger stores, between 50,000 and 100,000 square feet, which weren't available in the past. As a group, these new stores are generating higher-than-average sales productivity, above average gross margin rates and strong financial returns, and we see a very long runway to open more of them over time. \n And finally, after store comp growth of 18% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by traffic, we're confident that we're already benefiting from a differentiated service model in our stores. But that's a lead we can't take for granted. So we're continually looking for ways to get even better. So this year, our store teams are rolling out an enhanced service model, focused on consistency of every interaction to ensure that our guests will always feel welcomed and appreciated. And if they need help, there will be team members who can find solutions to enhance their experience. \n This new engagement model is strongly connected to our company purpose, culture and values. And we're supporting it with enhanced training and tools across the chain. It's designed not to be a one-and-done effort, but a sustainable model that's integrated with our operational goals, not something separate that's added on to everyday tasks. \n So as I turn it over to Michael, I want to once again thank the entire team for the incredible things you've already done and your passion to continually raise the bar. This year, I'm celebrating my 25th year at Target, so you might be tempted to think I've seen it all. But when I step back and realize what this team has accomplished in the last year under the most challenging of circumstances, it's clear that there is no limit to this team's potential, and there's no doubt that we have the best team in retail. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. Paul, it's good to talk to you. As you know well, we've talked about stores as hubs now for going on 4 years. And we have always said, we like it for a couple of reasons: One, great guest service; and two, better economics. Same-day services are that on steroids. They have much better economics than shipping something to someone's home because, as we've talked about, the shipping expense is the biggest part of delivering something to someone's home. So if we take that out of the equation, then we end up with economics that are much closer to the store transaction. \n The thing we love about all of the same-day services, pick up, Drive-Up and ship, all of them continue to grow faster than our overall digital growth, and we continue to find ways to improve them, as you said. Part of that is investing in technology for our teams, improving their sort paths and improving how they pick. We've done a great deal of process work to break things apart, to make it simpler for our teams to execute. We've done things to help them find items in the store so that we don't end up with what we call, INFs, or items not found. \n And then we continue to invest in helping them physically. And that's a big focus for us this year and will be over the next couple of years. In the case of Drive-Up, which as we've talked about a couple of times, Brian talked about and I talked about, has been our fastest-growing same-day service since -- basically since we started it. It also has our highest NPS score, so guests love it. We let you decide when you want to come. We don't force you into a time slot. And then our team brings it out to you in 2 minutes or less. So our guests absolutely love that. And you'll see us invest in making that easier for our team, building capacity on the front end of the store. \n Over the past year, we've rolled out adding temperature control products to Drive-Up. And so you'll see us have refrigeration and freezers to the front end of the store, all behind the wall so that our guests don't see that, but making it much easier for our teams to execute. And then much safer, we'll make it much easier for them to walk out to cars, protect them from the environment a little bit. So all of that experience continues to improve as well. \n So every year, our team comes up with multiple ways to continue to improve the service, first and foremost, for the guest, and then on the back end, improve things for our team so they can execute it easier as we continue to grow. So we see a lot more opportunity for us. And as I said, that will be a big part of our capital investment over the next several years. Yes. Scott, just building on what Brian said. Basically, I think our thought has always been, the best way to staff our stores and our supply chain, frankly, is to limit turnover. And so let's invest in our team, give them a great experience. And you've seen us do that for several years now. We've invested in wages. We've invested in benefits. Just as importantly, we've invested in training to help upskill them. And then over the course of the past 1.5 years or so, we've invested in safety very overtly. \n And so as Brian said, engagement is very high. Turnover is down significantly relative to 2019. So we feel really good about where our store's at. And as turnover decreases, you get so many benefits, right? We get team members that know their jobs. We get team members that know their guests that are in their stores because they're in there weekly. They can engage with them. And this kind of gets to the service model where the idea is to engage with our guests, make them feel welcomed, and importantly, solve their problem. If they have an issue, solve it in the moment for them. \n And so you'll see us continue to do that. We're very encouraged by what we see. Our NPS scores across all of our services, including the in-store experience, are up over last year and up over 2019. So we're just getting started on this journey, but the early results are very encouraging. And I would just finish where Brian did. We -- you've heard us say for a long time, we have the best team in retail, and we absolutely believe that's the truth. Yes. And on the sort centers, Kate, we remain pretty excited about this opportunity, but I would caution you that it's early days for us still. We're -- we always talk about crawl, walk, run. I'd say we're still firmly in crawl here in Minneapolis. And so we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. But the play here is a couple of things. \n And first of all, it's about capacity in the stores. So if we can sweep packages out of the stores more routinely than once a day, that frees up space, and that frees up space for us to pack additional products in the store. And that's an important thing for us. Then as we move downstream, the more granular sort is where we start to see potentially cost reductions as we can sort to provide to our carrier partners further downstream in their operations. And like we'd announced about a month ago, using the Deliv technology, creating local routes for local packages, we can get very efficient on delivery using Shipt and Shipt drivers. And so put all that together and our guest gets a great experience, we create more capacity. And we have the opportunity to continue to improve what we believe are already advantaged economics because of our stores-as-hub model. So more to come on all that. It's early days, but we remain pretty optimistic on all 3 of those fronts."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. \n The first quarter felt like a first step towards a post-pandemic world. And our team and operating model continues to walk alongside our guests and communities, serving them well through another chapter of growth and healing. From our unique mix of categories, to our unmatched set of fulfillment options, our business is delivering what consumers want and need each and every day. \n The results we delivered in Q1 are nothing short of outstanding. Comparable sales grew by nearly 23%, making our fourth consecutive quarter in which comp sales grew more than 20%. Maintaining that pace this quarter was especially notable, given that we were comping over double-digit growth a year ago. \n Over the last 2 years, comp sales have grown about 36%. And total sales expanded by $6.5 billion in the first quarter alone. This year's sales growth reflected more than $1 billion in market share gains, a clear signal of how relevant guests find our experience even though they have many more shopping options available compared with this time last year. \n In a quarter featuring many things to celebrate, I'm most proud of the performance of our stores. With vaccinations rolling out across the country and consumers increasingly comfortable venturing out, we've seen an enthusiastic return to in-store shopping. Guests are happy to come back to our stores because they love the environment we've created and invested in over time. \n As a result, our store comp sales increased 18% in Q1, driven almost entirely by higher traffic and accounting for the vast majority of our growth. Contrast that to a year ago when the channel mix of our business was changing rapidly, with guests leaning heavily into our digital fulfillment options, essentially our same-day services in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. \n A year ago on this call, we were highlighting a digital comp of 141%, driven by growth in our same-day services of more than 275%. These 2 contrasting scenarios clearly demonstrate the flexibility of our operating model. But they also show how our stores and digital channels complement each other to drive guest engagement. \n Even though digital stole the headlines a year ago, our store comps actually increased about 1% in the first quarter last year. And this year, while store sales accounted for most of our growth, first quarter digital comp sales also grew 50%, on top of last year's enormous numbers. This is the power of 'and'. Guests turn to Target because of our stores and our digital options, not one versus the other. And for us, the distinction between a store sale and a digital sale is largely irrelevant. \n Because of our unique stores-as-hub model, more than 3/4 of our first quarter digital sales were fulfilled by our stores. That means, in total, more than 95% of Target's first quarter sales were driven by our store assets, store inventory and store teams. This store-driven growth is translating to outstanding bottom line performance. \n Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $3.69 established a new all-time high for the company. Compared to 2020 when profitability took a temporary dip, this year's performance represents an astounding increase, more than sixfold. If we look back to first quarter, this year's adjusted EPS was more than 140% higher, demonstrating how far our business has advanced in a short time. \n I want to pause here and thank our team members across the world. They have consistently demonstrated incredible passion, commitment and focus to serve our guests and take care of each other. I am grateful and proud to serve with this outstanding team and to share the incredible business results they're delivering quarter after quarter. \n It's also important to highlight how the category mix plays a key role in the flexibility of our model. For instance, with guests venturing out, we've seen an incredible rebound in apparel sales, with Q1 comp growth of more than 60%. On the other hand, and as expected, we experienced lower growth in Food, Beverages and Essentials, as we annualized the peak stock-up period a year ago. Most notably, we saw continued strength in our Home and Hardlines categories, which delivered outsized growth on top of very strong numbers a year ago. Christina will provide more details in a few minutes. \n A relentless focus on operational excellence is another key factor in our performance. This is best summarized by our guest satisfaction scores, which across all of our services, have remained stable or moved higher despite record growth that's now compounding on a 2-year basis. This is a clear testament to the diligence of our team and the return on our investments in training, hours and wages over the last several years. Over those years, sales in our same-day services, order pickup, Drive-Up and ship have accounted for the bulk of our digital growth, and they grew to well over half of our digital sales in the first quarter. \n Same-day penetration has more than doubled since Q1 of 2019, when sales through these services accounted for less than 1/3 of our digital sales. While all 3 same-day services continue to grow faster than overall digital, Drive-Up has been a standout and consistently receives the highest ratings of anything we do. This service only accounted for about 5% of our first quarter digital sales 2 years ago, and that ratio expanded to more than 30% this year. \n Put another way, in the first quarter alone, Drive-Up sales have grown by well over $1 billion in the last 2 years. As John will outline in more detail, we continue to expand the assortment available for Drive-Up, and we've earmarked capital investments to make Drive-Up even more convenient for our guests and efficient for our team, given that we anticipate continued rapid growth of this service. \n While it's gratifying to see what our team has accomplished over the last several years, there is much more opportunity in front of us. We're planning significant investments in our store assets, as we remodel hundreds more locations, roll out new Ulta and Apple shopping environments, invest in the efficiency of our same-day services, and enter new neighborhood by opening new small- and medium-sized stores we're also investing in our brand portfolio, as we focus on presenting the best owned and national brands to our guests, which we highlight through the best in-store and digital shopping experience in the market. \n We're also making continued investments in safety and cleanliness, reinforcing the trust and confidence we've already established with our guests. And we continue to invest in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and advancement, to ensure that Target continues to be a destination for top talent. And as you've seen from many of our recent announcements, we're investing to leverage our size and scale, purpose and values to work for all families. \n This summer, we'll share more information about our refreshed enterprise sustainability strategy that further draws on our company legacy of corporate responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. As part of our immediate efforts, we'll focus on designing and elevating sustainable brands, innovating to eliminate waste, and accelerating opportunity and equity in all communities, all in service to a safe and prosperous future for all. \n It was 4 years ago, at the beginning of 2017, that we first announced our plan to double down on investments and growth. The decisions we announced that day and the investments we made in the intervening years left us well prepared to handle all the challenges and opportunities presented by the pandemic. \n In that first quarter of 2017, our business generated sales of just over $16 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.21; 4 years later, first quarter sales have grown nearly 50% and adjusted earnings per share have tripled. From today's vantage point, the opportunities ahead of us, both this year and over time, are just as bright as they were on that day 4 years ago. Despite what's already been accomplished, we've only scratched the surface of what this brand and this team can accomplish over time. I'm excited to stand with them as we write the next chapter in this great company's history. \n Now I'll turn it over to Christina, who will share more perspective on our first quarter results and for priorities going forward. Christina? Before we move to your questions, I want to pause and acknowledge again the role our team plays in the outstanding results we delivered this quarter. I'm thankful for their continued focus on our guests, focus on operational excellence and passion for our brand. \n I also want to acknowledge the challenges facing our India headquarter team, along with our team members who have family there, given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. We have been carefully monitoring conditions on the ground and providing extra support to our team during this difficult time to ensure they can take care of themselves and their families. We've also funded $500,000 donation to UNICEF set to increase access to option treatment in hospitals across the country and bring testing resources to the hardest hit communities. We're hopeful that conditions there will continue to improve. \n So now as we get ready to move to your questions, I want to underscore the confidence you've heard throughout our remarks today. Coming off an unbelievable year in 2020, we had a lot of confidence as we entered 2021, but our first quarter results came in far ahead of our baseline expectations. \n With the macro and consumer backdrop that's been surprisingly positive, we've seen remarkable momentum in our performance, even as we started to comp over the period of peak increases a year ago. The flexibility of our category mix and fulfillment options, combined with an agile, energetic and engaged team, continue to resonate with our guests, driving double-digit traffic growth and an increase in average tickets in the first quarter. \n But as you've often heard me say, we shouldn't confuse performance with potential. So even after more than a year of unprecedented growth, we're seeing focus and leaning into the opportunities ahead of us, making investments to build on an already strong foundation. With these investments, I'm confident that our business model and outstanding team will continue to raise the bar on an already best-in-class retail experience, resulting in even stronger loyalty and guest engagement over time. \n With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Well, why don't I let Christina spend some time talking about what we're seeing with categories, some of the highlights between our own brands and national brands. Obviously, Christina highlighted the fact that despite our overall robust performance in the quarter, owned brands grew by 36%, a record performance for us. So we're clearly seeing great performance in both our own brands and national brands. \n But Christina, why don't you build on some of what we're seeing in the different categories? Well, Paul, thanks again for joining us this morning. Why don't we let John Mulligan talk about some of the progress we've made from a same-day fulfillment standpoint. John, the only thing I might add is as we saw our guests turn to same-day services during the pandemic using pickup and Drive-Up and ship, we expect those services to be very sticky over time. And certainly, I think we've matured the awareness and the use of those same-day services by 2, 3, if not 4 years. And certainly, as we go into the back half of the year and during the holiday season, I think we're going to continue to see our guests turn to ship and Drive-Up and pick up. That's just an easy and convenient way to shop at Target. Karen, thanks again for joining us today. And I appreciate the question on market share. As you look at our business, and I think you know our Target guests and our Target shopper, we're appealing to all demographics. And we've had over -- now well over 30 million guests who shop us every week. Most of America shops at Target. And I think as we look at it, we're picking up share across all these various cohorts. So it's not one consumer, it's all of the guests who are shopping Target and as they return to our stores, shopping multiple categories. \n And I think that's the magic behind our performance, is that great combination of in-store experience, the ease and convenience of digital, but that multi-category portfolio and that unique combination of our own brands and curated national brands, we appeal to a broad group of consumers in different cohorts. And we're picking up share across all of these different areas. Michael, why don't you start? And then we can provide some additional color as Christina talks about our inventory positions. Well, Scott, thanks for joining us. Why don't I start and then I'll let John build on my comments. \n But as I said earlier today, we've been investing in our team for many years now. And we took an industry-leading position with our starting minimum wage. We've continued to invest over the last year in the health and wellness and safety of our teams. And I think that's allowed us to build even deeper engagement with our teams and stores and our teams and supply chain. \n So I do think it gives us a competitive advantage. And I think the focus we place on our team, the care of our team, making sure we're investing in their training, their development, their growth, I think that's really provided us with a unique experience. And I think it's one of our competitive advantages in the marketplace. \n John? John and I had a review just yesterday with our store team leaders who look at turnover and retention rates, and we just continue to see stronger and stronger numbers. And back to the point that John had made. So the operating model changes we've made over the last few years, putting experts in place in areas like beauty and technology, those team members are really passionate about the work that they do, and they continue to learn and grow every day. And I think that focus on providing training and development opportunities, the expertise that we're providing in those key categories, that's going to continue to provide benefits to us over time. So Joe, thanks for that final question. It's a great place for us to wrap up. And hopefully, for all of you, you recognize the confidence we have in our business as we go forward, the execution that we're seeing across all of our different functions and the way we're focused on serving the guests. \n So I appreciate everyone joining us today. And operator, that concludes our first quarter earnings call. So thanks again for joining us."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. As we enter 2021, we knew it would be a year like no other. That's because we're coming off of 2020, which was, by far, the most unusual year any of us have ever experienced. As such, we knew there'd be a wide range of potential outcomes for our sales, both by category and in total. And so far, with one quarter behind us, results have been extremely positive across every dimension. \n In the face of this strength, we've seen an incredible response from our teams across the board, from our stores, to our merchants, to the supply chain, who've all worked together in service of our guests. While there are many ways to measure the impact of those efforts, guest loyalty and market share are the 2 most important measures of success in this volatile time. \n Consequently, it's incredibly gratifying to see that across every one of our guest segments in the first quarter, we measured an increase in average trips per guest and a larger average basket. This led to more than $1 billion of additional market share in the quarter, on top of $1 billion gain a year ago. \n In terms of category performance, we saw the strongest growth in our Apparel business, which delivered comp growth in the low 60% range. As Brian mentioned, we saw a temporary dip in apparel sales last year, when first quarter comps were down around 20%. Following this year's strong increase, first quarter apparel sales have grown approximately 29% over the last 2 years. \n Home also delivered incredible growth with an increase in the mid-30% range, on top of a high single-digit increase a year ago. Within Home, growth was strong across the board, with the most robust performance in our decorative home and seasonal businesses. \n Hardlines also delivered huge volume, with comp growth above 30%, on top of a 20% increase a year ago. Results were led by sporting goods and toys, which both saw comps above 40%. \n Beauty comp in the high teens, on top of a high single-digit growth a year ago. Within Beauty, the skin care, sun care and bath categories delivered comp growth in the mid-30% range, with cosmetics growing in the low 20s. \n Finally, our Essentials and Food categories both delivered comps in the low to mid-single digits. To see healthy growth on top of last year is remarkable as you'll recall that a year ago, guests were aggressively stocking up their pantries, fridges and freezers, and we sold virtually every unit of paper goods that we owned. \n Beyond category strength, I want to pause and also highlight that sales on Target's own brands grew approximately 36% in the first quarter, the strongest increase we've ever recorded. Because of our unique capabilities in product design, development and sourcing, our own brand products offer an unbeatable combination of design, quality and value. These brands aren't something that our guests pick up while they're at Target, they're a big reason why they shop at Target, which is why we continue to invest in them. \n We frequently talk about performance by category and our brands because it's important that our entire portfolio is healthy and well positioned to meet our guest needs. But it's also important to realize that they create value for our guests beyond simply the sum of the parts. Rather, it's the combination of all our offerings, including categories, brands and services across our distinct multichannel experience, that allows Target to serve our guest needs today and over time. \n Last year, as guests focused more on enjoying time at home, that had implications not just for our Home category, but also for Hardlines, Food & Beverage and Essentials. And their focus on health and well-being affected trends in activewear, Beauty, health care, Food & Beverage and more. \n The same is true for our sales channels. As guests last year focused on social distancing, they leaned into digital, including our same-day services. And this year, as they're looking to get back out in public, they're flocking to our stores, based on the trust we established over time, which was further reinforced by last year's investments. \n So as we plan the remainder of the year, both in total and by category, we continue to listen closely to our guests to understand how they're thinking and feeling. And when we talk to our guests today, they tell us they want to maintain some of the new habits and routines they formed during the pandemic, including an enhanced focus on the joy of home and health and well-being of their family. \n At the same time, there's a rapidly emerging emphasis on style and mobility as guests feel increasingly safe in public spaces. That trend is playing out in an explosive demand for dresses and cosmetics as well as luggage and categories based on being active like sporting goods and Performance Activewear. This reinforces the concept of 'and'. Target can fulfill our guests' needs as they focus on home and health and when they look to venture out. We can welcome them back into our stores and continue to serve them with the same-day services they've recently tried and now love. \n So after a record-setting first quarter, we're keeping our foot on the gas, based on our guests' desire to bring rejuvenated life and energy to their homes, celebrate seasonal moments with loved ones and step out in public. I could not be more excited about the ways we're ready to inspire and energize our guests. \n Just last week, we launched our latest limited-time collection, Hilton Carter for Target. Off to a great start, this collection features live plants, foe greenery and unique plant accessories for experienced and novice gardeners alike. Not to be outdone by their parents, younger kids want to make their spaces their own. And our popular kids brand, Pillowfort, will continue to help them do just that. For its 5-year anniversary, Pillowfort is celebrating with hundreds of new items that can grow with them and be used in any area of the house. \n As our guests begin stepping out, they're focused on looking and feeling their best. With this rekindled passion for fashion, our guests will be overjoyed with the latest installment of our designer dress collection. Featuring designs by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo, this assortment offers more than 70 original and affordable dresses in bold, bright patterns and statement silhouettes. And of course, with our continual focus on inclusivity and celebrating everybody, this collection features affordable prices in a range of sizes from XXS to 4X.\n We've long focused on making Target a destination for holidays and life events, and we just wrapped up a huge Mother's Day season. We had solutions for mom across the store, from apparel, gifting, beauty, flowers, candy and more. And now we're gearing up for Father's Day in June. We've got a great assortment of gifts for dad, from All in Motion attire for golfing, hitting the gym or just hanging out, to a line of shave, skin care and hair care products from Goodfellow.\n Of course, June celebrations aren't exclusive to dad. With so many in-person celebrations canceled last year, we're ecstatic about our fabulous new assortment for Pride as we celebrate love with our LGBTQIA guests, team members and neighbors. \n Later in the summer, we know families are excited to celebrate the 4th of July with a long-awaited neighborhood cookout, a road trip out of town or an intimate backyard barbecue with a few fireworks. With great deals and the perfect owned and national brand assortments, it doesn't matter if the celebration is big or small, Target is everything you'll need to fill a cooler, pack a beach bag and fill up with friends, family and fun. \n And before we know it, it's time to head back to school, and we're planning for one of our biggest back-to-school and college seasons ever. Of course, we'll have great deals on all the traditional school supplies, but we'll also have the new normals on the school supply list, like hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. \n With local school lists on target.com and our industry-leading fulfillment options, back-to-school shopping has never been safer or easier. And with the great new apparel offerings from Cat & Jack, Art Class, More than Magic, Wild Fable, Original Use and All in Motion, all found only at Target, we'll have our school-bound guests looking and feeling fresh for that first day of school. \n Before I close, I want to pause and highlight some of the work I'm most passionate about, and that's our work on Target's REACH Committee, which we formed last year to achieve lasting systemic change for our black guests, team members and communities. This work aligns with our vision for sustainability at Target, and it's a strong example of how we're becoming an equitable company, creating change that strengthens our business. \n Hopefully, you've seen our recent announcement that Target is committed to spending more than $2 billion with black-owned businesses by the end of 2025. In addition, we've announced a new scholarship program to support students and more than a dozen historically black colleges and universities. And this summer, both in-store and online, we are adding more items to our Black Beyond Measure assortment. I'm so proud of these efforts and everything we do to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. \n I also want to give a quick shout out to our store teams. I recently had a chance to visit stores in the New York City market. And after more than a year in which most of my meetings have been virtual, it was an incredibly energizing experience. I visited new small-format locations across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn. Every location was a unique reflection of the local neighborhood, from design, to assortment and the team members serving their neighbors. Based on the energy and passion I could feel from these teams, it's clear why we're seeing such strong sales in our stores across the country. \n As the first Chief Growth Officer at Target, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunities still ahead of us. As you saw throughout 2020 and now in 2021, we have a long runway to continue investing in and growing our core business. At the same time, we'll continue to develop innovation pipelines and explore new initiatives, maintaining a balance between fundamentals and execution and the exploration of new opportunities. As we plan for future growth, we'll continue to listen to our guests and apply those insights to prioritize their work. With this guest-first approach, we're confident we can continue to build relevance and market share, both today and over time. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Absolutely. Bob, thanks for the question. As Brian was just sharing, we really are excited about the strength across the board. Apparel was certainly a stand out in this quarter with growing over 60%, and that came from a range of brands in every segment of the business. \n But the reality is the 3 trends that I talked about in my prepared remarks are benefiting our multi-category approach across the board: joy at Home and the opportunity to celebrate everything that brings the guests to their home, eating, being with their families, and the investments that they've made over time in their home; health and well-being, the opportunities that our guests are taking to invest in proactive health care and fitness at home and activewear. \n And then the newer and more emerging trend is really style and mobility. As guests are going out, they are looking for a fresh look. So our newest collections of dresses by Christopher John Rogers, Alexis and Rixo couldn't have been more perfectly timed to really help guests look their best in what they're wearing and certainly also across their beauty trends. Yes. Joe, I'd be happy to talk about that. So we're very excited about what these life moments afford us in the back half. The opportunity for a little more \"normalcy,\" it really creates opportunities for us to be relevant with our guests in many different ways. \n And so you think about back-to-school as a huge moment where the convenience of our assortment across a multi-category portfolio is already a preferred destination. But then you think about how that leads into opportunities in Halloween and Thanksgiving and the holidays, opportunities for our families to be together and celebrate, sometimes for the first time in almost 2 years. And so this is where the power of our assortment, and the gifting opportunities, the value equation that we offer and the resonance with our brand really shine. And so that means we're very excited about what the full outlook will be."

            "content": "Thanks, John. When I think about the underlying themes of our recent performance, the most dominant one by far has been the unprecedented growth and share gains we've seen over the last 5 quarters. \n On the P&L, the leverage resulting from growth has more than offset all of the unique headwinds we faced over this challenging period, resulting in really strong performance. Target's total sales grew 23.3% in the first quarter, reflecting comp growth of 22.9%. Given last year's double-digit growth, first quarter sales have expanded more than 37% over the last 2 years, driven almost entirely by higher comps. Unlike last year, when consumers were consolidating trips and shopping less often, this year's comp growth was driven primarily by a traffic increase of more than 17% combined with a 5% increase in average ticket. \n As Brian mentioned, store comps were the growth engine this year, while digital was the primary driver in Q1 2020. As such, over the last 2 years, both our stores and digital channels have expanded their first quarter sales by more than $3 billion. This balance highlights the relevance and complementary nature of both channels in serving our guest needs. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate of 30% was 490 basis points ahead of last year when we faced a number of temporary headwinds, including markdowns and other costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. Compared with 2019, this year's first quarter gross margin rate was about 40 basis points higher, which is notable given that digital sales penetration more than doubled in that time, from 7.1% in 2019 to more than 18% this year. \n In terms of the year-over-year gross margin drivers, mix had a positive impact of about 150 basis points, reflecting the dramatic increase in apparel sales and continued strength in our home category. The remaining favorability was driven by core merchandising, as we continued to benefit from low promotional and clearance markdown rates, and we annualized last year's costs to rightsize our apparel inventory. The rate impact of supply chain and digital fulfillment costs was approximately neutral compared to last year, as the costs of outsized digital growth were offset by the benefit of a stronger mix of same-day fulfillment and our ongoing work to control unit costs across our entire suite of digital fulfillment options. \n Our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 18.6% this year, down more than 2 percentage points from 20.7% a year ago and 20.8% in 2019. In terms of drivers, leverage benefits have more than offset all of the extra costs we've absorbed over the last 2 years, including meaningfully higher pay and benefits for our team and other investments to protect the health and safety of our team and guests. \n While D&A expenses have grown in each of the last 2 years, this year's first quarter D&A expense rate was about 40 basis points lower than a year ago and about 80 basis points lower than 2019. \n Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate increased an astounding 7.4 percentage points compared with a year ago to an unprecedented 9.8% this year, from a temporary low of 2.4% rate a year ago. However, even compared to a very healthy 6.4% operating margin rate in the first quarter of 2019, this year's rate was more than 3 percentage points higher. In terms of dollars, first quarter operating income has more than doubled over the last 2 years. \n On the bottom line, our business delivered first quarter GAAP EPS of $4.17, up more than 600% from a year ago and well over double our 2019 GAAP EPS. On the adjusted EPS line, which excluded the gain from the sale of our DermStore business, we earned $3.69 this year, more than 500% higher than a year ago and well over double our 2019 adjusted EPS. \n As you know, our capital deployment priorities remain the same as they've been for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business, in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we returned cash through our quarterly dividend, which we've maintained every quarter as a public company and grown every year since 1971. And finally, we returned excess cash over time through share repurchases, within the limits of our middle A debt ratings. \n In the first quarter, we invested just over $0.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our business. We continue to expect our full year CapEx will be approximately $4 billion, but the bulk of those expenditures will be more backloaded in the year, given the timing of this year's projects. \n We paid dividends of $340 million in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago, as growth in the per share dividend was partially offset by a decline in share count. And finally, we resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, following a temporary pause in 2020, and deployed about $1.2 billion to retire 6.1 million shares at an average share price of just under $191. And in February, we completed the sale of our DermStore business, which contributed just over $350 million to our first quarter cash flow. \n Altogether, we ended the quarter with about $7.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. This was down about $700 million from the beginning of the quarter, but still well above where we expect to operate over time. With this cash, we'll be funding approximately $3.5 billion of additional CapEx in 2021 and we'll be recommending a robust increase in our quarterly dividends to the Board later this year. Beyond these uses, we should have ample capacity for continued share repurchases, and we'll continue to govern the magnitude and pace of repurchases in support of our goal to maintain our Middle A credit ratings. And given where we are today, it will likely be a multiyear journey before our debt metrics move fully back to where they've been over time. \n Now I'd like to turn briefly to our return on invested capital, which reflects both our operating results and the investments we've made to generate them. In the first quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC moved up to 30.7%, which is well over double the 13.4% we reported a year ago. While we've indicated that this measure will likely be volatile in the near term and could revert to a very healthy number, near 20% over time, the fact that our business has generated such a high after-tax return over the last 12 months is a testament both to the strength of our model and outstanding execution by our team. \n Now let me turn to our sales outlook. We learned a lot in the first quarter, and notably, got our first look at how our business is successfully comping the comp, with impressive growth on top of last year's strong surge in sales. Also, and importantly, we've continued to gain market share on top of last year's dramatic share gains. Based on these results, we're now planning for our business to deliver a mid- to high single-digit comp increase in the second quarter. This expectation is in line with the 2-year growth rates we saw in the first quarter. \n And while we only have a couple of weeks in the quarter behind us, the results we've seen so far this month are consistent with this outlook. The range for second quarter operating income remains wide, but should remain strong, far ahead of our 2019 rate of 7.2%, but perhaps not fully as high as last year's unprecedented rate of 10%. \n In terms of the specific puts and takes in the quarter, we'll be comping over last year's reversal of the return reserve estimate, which added about $110 million to last year's operating income. In addition, this year, we're making purposeful investments in store labor hours to ensure we deliver outstanding service and stronger in-stocks than a year ago, when sales grew far beyond our expectations. Of course, we'll continue to benefit from meaningful sales leverage, given that we're planning for healthy growth on top of last year's record-setting increase. Putting that all together, we expect to see continued strong performance on this line. \n In the back half of the year, the range of possibilities for comp growth is also quite wide, and we'll gain more insights as the year progresses. As of today, based on our recent results and confidence going forward, we expect to see positive single-digit comps in the back half of the year, on top of last year's unprecedented performance. \n Regarding our full year operating margin rate, following an exceptionally strong first quarter, we have increasing confidence in the consumer and industry backdrop in the back half of the year. As such, the range of outcomes for our 2021 operating margin rate has moved significantly higher. So despite the anticipated headwind from higher markdown rates following last year's historically low rates, we believe that our business is positioned to deliver a full year operating margin rate that's well over last year's rate of 7%. More specifically, we believe this year's operating margin rate could reach 8% or perhaps a little higher. We'll continue to refine our view throughout the year. \n As the team looks ahead to the rest of the year, they're focused on staying agile in what continues to be a volatile environment. Rather than placing all of their bets on a single forecast number, they're focused on contingency planning, creating flexibility that will allow us to react to unexpected changes, and importantly, take advantage of opportunity when we see it. \n We're also excited about the investments still ahead of us and the growth they'll create: hundreds more remodels; dozens of new stores; new Ulta and Apple shopping environments; and supply chain investments to support both replenishment and fulfillment. Given the performance we're seeing today, which is the product of the investments we've made over the last few years, we're eagerly leading into future opportunities to enable more profitable, high-return growth over time. \n Before I turn it back over to Brian, I want to add my voice and thanks to the team. The value our team members are creating for our business, communities, shareholders and each other goes far beyond what we can measure in a P&L. Thanks for making Target an even stronger company on behalf of all of our stakeholders. \n Brian? Yes. Sure, Paul. Thanks for the question. And I touched on this a bit in my remarks, but if I had to summarize our profit story, it goes back to the scale benefits we see when we have growth. And our plan for the back part of the year is to see growth on top of some of the strongest quarters in Target's history last year. So we would expect that leave to -- to lead to improving profit rates on a year-over-year basis. And there's still a wide range of where those numbers might ultimately land, and we'll continue to refine our point of view as the year progresses. But scale is a wonderful thing. And we've seen impressive growth over last year, and we expect more to come in the balance of this year. Sure. Well, first off, Karen, we feel really good about our inventory position heading into the second quarter. And you can see we're up on a year-over-year basis, and we should be given the growth in sales that we've seen and continue to expect. \n When it comes to markdowns through the balance of the year, we've talked about this a little bit previously, we were sold through in a lot of seasons last year, and that's not optimal for us. We don't want to look at empty shelves at the end of a seasonal set. And so with our anticipation for growth in the remainder of this year, we'll be buying appropriately to that. And hopefully, that means we've got fuller shelves at the end of a season. And with that, will come some clearance markdowns, there will be a little bit of a drag on markdown rates on a year-over-year basis if I had to guess. But I would welcome a little bit of that rate drag because it means that we're full and in stock for the guests throughout the season. Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Well, we would expect, like I said in my remarks, the second quarter to be far ahead of the 2-year ago performance, likely not as high as last year. But there's still a broad range around that outcome. And so we'll see as the quarter plays out exactly where we land. \n Worth noting, and I touched on this as well, there's some factors unique to the quarter. We've got a $110 million headwind from the way our returns reserve calendarizes between Q1 and Q2. And the second thing is, we're investing, and we'll continue to invest in the team and in-store payroll to make sure we're staffed and in stock to support the sales we expect to come. And our teams have done just an incredible job this year providing such great guest experience. And we want to make sure we're investing to continue to support that and to support growth. Yes. So maybe I'll speak to actuals and unpack the first quarter just a little bit versus 2 years ago. If you look at kind of versus our 2019 performance, we saw markdown efficiency. And we've talked about that, lower levels of promotional and clearance markdown rates in 2019. On a 2-year basis, mix is actually about 40 basis points of a drag in the first quarter. And also, on a 2-year basis, you can see digital and supply chain pressure of a shade over 1 point given the growth in the digital business and the impact that, that has to rate. And so those are familiar drivers we've talked about over time. Where those drivers land for the balance of the year will dictate where margin ultimately falls. Sure. Thanks for the question, Kate. I can start, and then maybe John can provide more color on the sortation center work that we're doing. We didn't see pressure on the supply chain and digital line this quarter. That's due in part to the just incredible strength in our store business, with stores up 18% on a year-over-year basis. \n I get excited by the efficiency improvements I see us continue to make in our digital experience. John talked to some of those just a minute ago. But we can do a lot with the volumes that we've built over the last 2 years in some of those same-day services. And all of that volume translates to more efficiency opportunity as we can continue to squeeze down the per unit cost to fulfill. \n But I don't shy away from growth -- or from a drag on that line from a growing digital business. And the reason why is, when guests lean into digital, when we get more omnichannel guests, more guests using Drive-Up, more guests using same-day, even if that sale itself comes at a slightly lower rate, it does incredible things for the rest of our P&L because we see those guests spend more in total, about 30% more for a new Drive-Up or Shipt guest. And that's way more important than the little bit of rate drag we've seen over time from digital growth, and that's how we continue to think about it."

        "content": "John Hulbert: Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 2023 Financial Community Meeting. I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting remotely. And of course, we're happy that so many of you have joined us here in person today.  \n Before I turn it over to Brian to start the meeting, I have a couple of important disclosures. First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to begin the meeting.\n [Presentation] \nBrian Cornell: Well, good morning, and thank you for joining us. Looking forward to spending this time with you. We're eager to share our plans, including how we'll continue to grow, how we'll continue to rebuild profitability on that growth and how we'll strengthen our business in conditions that have changed a lot since we gathered here at the Time Center last year.  \n At that time, we just passed a crucial milestone. We had just become a $106 billion company. For the full year 2022, which we're reporting today, we placed another $3.1 billion of revenue growth on top of that growth. We grew traffic by 2.1%. We gained unit share across our core merchandising categories, which means that consumers were constrained by inflation and have to be very selective about where they shop and what they buy, continue shopping and buying at Target. And despite difficulties throughout the year, we closed the books on 2022 with our 23rd straight quarter of comp sales growth. However, the path between last year's Time Center meeting and this one was anything but predictable. \n When we last gathered here, New York was still under a mask mandate. And though -- although consumers had started moving towards postpandemic behaviors, with families returning to travel and restaurants and shifting some dollars at a retail, we are just beginning to see how volatile and uncertain 2022 would become as spiraling inflation forced families to put discretionary purchases on hold and focus most of their spending on necessities. And there was a rapid escalation to the most expensive operating environment we've seen in decades, all of which was made worse by the spike in fuel prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine. Those variables and many others continue to have a profound effect on the retail landscape.  \n So this morning, we want to take stock of that situation. We want to speak clearly of how Target is planning to stay on our growth path for the years ahead. We're keeping this morning's agenda very focused on our strategy, operations, growth investments and financial expectations. We see this as a time to combine steady leadership with our long-term strategy and a continued focus on agility and strong focus on retail fundamentals. Our goals this morning are to show you how we're navigating near-term challenges. How the durability of our business model lies in its flexibility. We'll share what we're prioritizing to stay in step with our guests, and how we'll flex across our multi-category portfolio, which means, in the near term, leaning into growth in nondiscretionary categories.  \n We'll also reinforce how the trust and loyalty we've built with our guests shows in our traffic and share gains. Given value is absolutely top of mind right now, being able to deliver affordable joy, differentiates us in the marketplace. And that's a clear advantage in the near term and remains our focus over the long term. With those factors in mind, we also want to use this time to set clear and realistic expectations so shareholders and stakeholders can track what progress looks like in 2023. \n Taking a step back, I might start by recognizing that our growth in '22 didn't come easily. It wasn't nearly as profitable as we expect it to be over time. In 2020 and 2021, our team put in the effort and the hustle to keep pace with the most turbulent business environment many of us have ever seen. They brought the expertise and excellence to take the company to a new level. But while we gained incredible scale by continuing to prioritize our guests, I acknowledge we're still developing some of the tools to marshal that scale efficiently. \n Yet, as we think about what growth looks like from here, it's helpful to anchor back to what we were saying at year-end 2019. At that time, we were putting up proof points on a strategy that was and still is unique in retail, when we built to reliably deliver low single-digit increases in sales year after year. It started by investing in our team, in part because we believe human interaction is the key to growth in a digital age. As we move into 2023, we'll continue to support our team and lean into our culture, knowing they're at the heart of our overall success. \n The 2019 strategy put stores at the center of everything. Because when we remodeled or added a store and improve the guest experience, comps grew. At the same time, turning stores into fulfillment hubs was and still is the most efficient and least costly way to grow omnichannel sales. As you'll hear today, we're not standing still on our store remodel and expansion plans or investments in a bigger supply chain or ongoing improvements in digital. It's no surprise that 100% of our store sales are fulfilled by stores. But in our case, more than 95% of all sales, including digital, are, too.\n Since 2019, our store base has only grown slightly, but total sales grew nearly 40% in that time frame. Our digital business nearly tripled in size, and our sales per square foot increased by 37%. And fulfilling substantially all that growth through essentially the same asset base was nothing short of incredible on the part of our team. So as we hold on to those gains and look to put growth on top of them, we'll continue to invest in stores, in supply chain, in digital through our stores as hubs model. \n Our 2019 strategy prioritize the differentiation and profit performance of an owned brand portfolio that is simply unmatched in retail. At the same time, we're curating national brands our guests love. And in 2019, we had just started our premier partnerships with Levi's and Disney. Since then, both those partnerships have expanded, as of partnerships, with Apple and Starbucks. And as you know, we're in the middle of building on an incredibly exciting partnership with Ulta Beauty.  \n Meanwhile, our team has built on our position of strength in owned brands, adding 17 of them since 2019. That includes 2 more $1 billion-plus brands in Good & Gather and All In Motion. But we're not slowing down with owned brands. In fact, just the opposite. As you'll hear from Christina, we're planning a steady cadence of newness in owned brands and national brands across our multi-category portfolio in the year ahead.\n What else was in the 2019 strategy? Well, that was a year we introduced Target Circle. At that time, it was a powerful new asset for guest engagement, personalization, loyalty and sales that quickly attracted 50 million users. Since 2019, the user base has doubled and is still growing meaningfully. And Circle has become the heart of our increasingly connected loyalty ecosystem.  \n Since 2019, our media company, Roundel, has grown significantly with great additional growth and profit potential on the horizon. It's sought after by advertisers for its relevance and reach, and it's growing each year because our guests appreciate the engagement and the value it delivers. Roundel makes for a more deeply engaged guests and partners. And because it gives us better understanding of our guest preferences, it makes us an even better and more profitable retailer. So we intend to place additional emphasis and investment towards Circle and Roundel in 2023, given the growth potential they'll unlock.  \n So let's pause here, and I'll start to put all this together. While I'm deliberately drawing a connection between 2019 and the year ahead, there's one giant difference, we're starting 2023 on a revenue base of $109 billion, not the $78 billion we had back then. There are other big differences, too. Today, we're reporting a full year comp increase in the low single digits, similar to 2019, and unit share gains across all 5 of our core merchandising categories. But unlike 2019, our 3-year revenue growth is $30-plus billion, not just $8 billion. And our digital penetration now stands at nearly 19%.  \n During the pandemic, guests became more attached to Target. And as we deepened engagement with guests, more moved into the ranks of our most engaged, measured by spend, trips and cross-category purchases. Guest engagement is also reflected in a significant increase in transactions since 2019. In fact, those increases started as far back as 2017. And we're positioned to keep growing engagement levels across our guest base even as we focus on expanding that base overall.  \n So standing here today, my sense is that if a new normal is on the horizon, it will be much more like 2019 than the last 3 years. And as we plan prudently to invest in 2023, we see a return over time to solid and consistent growth with operating income margin rate that should move towards and then begin to move beyond our prepandemic rate of 6% in the next few years.  \n Today, we'll show you our work for how we arrived at that conclusion. But a spoiler alert, it starts with the strategy. You've seen it many times before, and while the facets on this slide haven't changed, we're prioritizing to accelerate key growth drivers and making changes that will help us respond to the short-term environment, while continuing to advance all elements of our strategy. They all work together to keep our growth trajectory rolling.\n Christina will cover that in greater detail, including the focus this year were placing on the magic of Tar-zhay, on affordable joy and on digital growth, Target Circle, Roundel and our enterprise sustainability strategy, Target Forward. Then John will cover what we're learning from an ongoing operational evolution, what we're testing, what we're in the process of optimizing, what benefits we see from the standpoint of efficiency as we continue to scale. Michael will describe how we're planning cautiously, and we believe appropriately, given the economic challenges we anticipate this year. \n But caution doesn't mean cut off from continued growth and progress. In fact, some of the most exciting progress we anticipate will be translating our newfound scale into simpler, more efficient ways to run Target. The difference between an enterprise-wide efficiency mindset and a cost-cutting program starts with what questions you ask yourself. For us, the question isn't, what can we cut? It's how do we make things easier for our team to more efficiently deliver a guest experience, that continues to live up to our brand promise. So we'll invite Mike O\u2019Neil, the leader we tapped to coordinate these efforts across Target, to offer his perspective on efficiency, what it is, what it isn't, how we can drive continuous improvement and what we can unlock with this focus.  \n We're looking forward to the next hour or so. We recognize that the landscape is unpredictable, and there are plenty of near-term challenges on the horizon. We believe 2023 will be a year in which the durability of our model allows us to flex up the categories and the value proposition that are most relevant to our guests today. We'll double down on execution, so our guests get all they've been promised every time they turn to Target. And we'll stay focused on gaining share across our portfolio, underpinning all the work we're doing around efficiency, to provide fuel for longer-term growth. We're optimistic about what this team can deliver and realistic about how 2023 will keep challenging us to be agile, resilient and responsive for our guests, our communities, for each other and for our shareholders.  \n Before we leave here today, our goal is to take you along. So you can see exactly what we're seeing. And with that, let's get going. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian. Despite the challenges of the past year, Target's differentiated position in retail has never been stronger. With a great assortment, compelling value, an unmatched suite of fulfillment options and a joyful shopping experience, Target continues to drive preference with American shoppers in the face of a turbulent economic and consumer backdrop.  \n We have continually adapted to the environment around us, delivering ease, value and inspiration to our guests, all at a time when daily doses of joy are needed more than ever. And amidst this volatility, we continue to hone the foundational elements that it takes to be a long-term winner in retail.  \n Fourth quarter comparable sales grew 0.7% on top of nearly 9% last year. And for the full year, comparable sales grew 2.2% on top of nearly 13% in 2021. While our business has been generating growth on top of growth for years now, the mix of last year's sales looked vastly different than what we had expected. \n Throughout 2022, changing attitude towards COVID, followed by the pressure from persistent inflation, caused demand for discretionary categories to slow meaningfully. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to this year's inventory commitments in many of these categories. And we're focusing on the agility of our operating model to adjust should sales trends exceed our expectations.  \n In light of the volatility we've experienced, I often get the question, what did Target learn from the past year? What I'll share with you today are some of the lessons learned. In short, we've learned that our strategy is working. At the same time, we've come to further appreciate the importance of strong day-to-day execution, combined with the agility required to react even quicker to changing consumer trends. And of course, last year, reinforced the importance of providing every guest with a great shopping experience. \n Most of what I'll share today likely won't sound all that different from the playbook we've used for the past few years. That is intentional. For example, our multicategory assortment continues to resonate with our guests, even as consumer demand continuously evolves. The unique balance we've achieved across all five of our core merchandising categories continues to be a key differentiator in the market, with each category serving at times as a trip driver, at other times as a basket builder, and oftentimes as both.  \n Throughout 2022, we saw and continue to see incredible growth in our Food & Beverage and Essentials & Beauty businesses, offsetting a meaningful pullback in discretionary categories like Home, Apparel and Hardlines. But despite this pullback, these discretionary categories still delivered around $55 billion in sales last year.  \n In both our Food & Beverage and Beauty categories, 2022 delivered the third consecutive year of double-digit sales growth, stemming from increases in both traffic and average ticket. And while we're thrilled to have driven unit share gains across all of our major categories last year, we saw the strongest gains in these rapidly growing frequency categories, a proof point of the relevance and value found in these assortments.  \n In Beauty, we continue to be a market leader, delivering the highest growth rates of any category we sell. We've been seeing outsized growth across the entire portfolio from everyday beauty assortments to new and exciting offerings like those we've added through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. In fact, last year's sales from Ulta Beauty at Target were more than 4x higher than in 2021, and this growth was almost entirely incremental. As such, we remain excited to continue opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and beyond.  \n Of course, we don't build an assortment for a given snapshot in time. Rather, we flex across our categories as consumer demand shifts. And even in tough times, our discretionary assortment provides a unique opportunity to connect with guests in key moments, from major life changes, to seasonal celebrations and everyday moments in between.\n Now I want to be clear that despite our cautious inventory position in discretionary categories, we're still focused on delivering newness throughout the portfolio and placing select bets in businesses where we believe market share opportunities are strongest. That's because despite continued volatility the path that Target guests are attracted to all things trendy and new. We believe our commitment to newness is a key reason why we continue to generate traffic growth, and why we drove broad unit share gains last year. \n Our focus on balance can be found within each category as well, where we continue to offer both industry-leading national brands and high-quality affordable owned brands that are unmatched by our competitors. Our owned brands have long been a source of pride and differentiation for Target, offering great style and quality, all at incredible value. So it's no surprise that our owned brands have continued to outpace total enterprise growth and why we have plans to launch new or extend assortments in more than 10 owned brands this year.  \n Recently, a study listing the 10 fastest-growing private label brands in 2022 included three found exclusively at Target. Target was the only retailer to have more than one brand on the list, and two of them were the only nonfood brands to make the cut.  \n Many retailers were not focused on newness in 2022, but the opposite was true at Target, where we continue to excite our guests with innovative and trendy products. For example, we launched Future Collective, a first-of-its-kind apparel owned brand, featuring collections in partnership with a rotating roster of diverse influencers. This innovative approach blending the strength of Target's owned brands with the excitement of our limited-time partnerships and collaborations has been a huge success, particularly with Black guests, furthering our commitment to ensure all guests see themselves reflected in our assortments.  \n Most recently, we launched a new line with actor and influencer, Tabitha Brown. Tabitha's energy and passion absolutely shines in this new line, and our guests are loving it. Tabitha serves as the latest example of the endless possibilities that comes from bringing together the incredible talents of diverse designers and the power of Target's multi-category portfolio.  \n Take a look and see what I mean.\n [Presentation] \nA. Hennington: The passion of these designers is so inspiring, the emotion and pride is palpable, and we love the way the Tar-zhay magic of these partnerships cut across categories, including last quarter's launch of Marks & Spencer and Tabitha's recent extension into food. \n And while these collaborations offer joy for our guests, recent history has reinforced that focusing on the basics of retail is just as important as the latest innovation or new offering. In fact, nailing the fundamentals is the bedrock of a successful retailer, from the overall shopping experience to ease and convenience, relevance, everyday value and more. \n Of these fundamentals, we know that a strong and reliable shopping experience is the surest way to build trust and affinity. So we aim to provide a consistent, joyous and easy experience, both in stores and online, making Target a shopping destination, not just a means to an end. To do this, we've invested heavily in new stores, our remodel program and our same-day fulfillment services, as John will highlight shortly. We led the way in comprehensive pay and benefits, attracting and retaining the best team in retail, allowing us to provide a level of service unmatched by our competitors.  \n We've invested in one-of-a-kind brand partnership experiences like those with Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. And while some of these partnerships are newer, we featured Starbucks in our stores for decades, proof that when we work with iconic brands, we build lasting relationships. With a Starbucks in nearly all of our stores, they have become part of the shopping ritual for many of our guests. In fact, we've served up more than 170 million Starbucks beverages last year alone.\n A strong digital shopping experience is every bit as important as the one we create in our stores. So we've been investing to ensure that the experience is seamless across every channel, regardless of how our guests shop. Whether searching for an item or browsing for inspiration, we continue to elevate their experience, providing personalized and relevant content using our incredible data and guest insights. This will include more customized homepages, improved search functionality and even more personalized offers from Target Circle. It will also include more relevant content from our digital advertising business, Roundel. Our digital success won't be driven by a single service or offering, but through a comprehensive set of experiences designed to be greater than the sum of the parts. \n Target Circle is one of the nation's leading loyalty programs with over 100 million members and growing. Through continuous learning and application of guest insights, Target Circle served up 3x more personalized offers in 2022 and Target Circle members spend 3x more on average this past holiday season.  \n We also continue to invest in the tools, team and capabilities of Roundel. To us, Roundel is more than a digital advertising platform or another revenue source in the P&L. The goal is for our guests to have a tailored, relevant experience, while helping our vendors reach the guests who are most likely to be interested in their products. Said simply, Roundel makes us better merchants, more consistently serving our guests with the products they want. This is why our approach to digital advertising looks different than others. We put our guests at the center of this strategy, just as we do in every other aspect of our business. It's no wonder we continue to see such explosive digital growth, why Roundel grew by more than 60% over the past 2 years, and why we'll continue to leverage the risk -- rich guest insights.\n And regardless of whether our guests are shopping online or in-store, they are looking for comprehensive value now more than ever. That means offering great everyday prices and promotions and offering quality and inspiration. After all, Target invented affordable joy decades ago and is still a key differentiator in a crowded retail market.  \n Our guests see value in countless ways, from our competitively priced and high-quality owned brand offerings to multiple RedCard benefits, including 5% off on every trip and free shipping for all online orders, all with no annual fee. We offer compelling value at every turn, and we are continuously listening to our guests to understand what value means to them. \n And beyond these retail basics, we continue to hear from our guests that they prefer shopping with companies who prioritize people and planet. That's why we're so focused on our Target Forward strategy. This isn't a standalone strategy, but rather Target Forward is fully integrated throughout our business, fueling our growth potential, while bettering the world.\n As part of this strategy, we'll continue to elevate Black voices and brands and are on track to spend $2 billion on Black-owned businesses by 2025. We'll also continue to focus on designing products for a circular future like in our owned brand, Universal Thread, where we are using materials such as recycled cotton and polyester. These are just a few of the countless examples of how we push ourselves and industry partners to grow sustainably.  \n Our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life requires a balance of quality, value and innovation that sets us apart from competitors. We are relentless in ensuring every decision supports this delicate balance. It's easy to say, but takes incredible diligence to execute. And while you've heard me say it before, it bears repeating now. We truly have the best team in retail. I'm so grateful for the many efforts of our team to serve our guests and each other, day in and day out.  \n With that, I'll turn things over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. So Brian talked about the last few years being unpredictable. To put a finer point on that, if you had told me in late 2020, during the height of the pandemic, that 2022 would be the most challenging operating environment in my career, well, I would have assumed you were joking. Yet shifting consumer preferences, supply chain volatility and rising inflation created a set of conditions that called for flexibility, responsiveness and resilience. Our environment remains volatile, and we expect 2023 will have its own unique set of challenges. But if I've learned anything over the past 3 years, it's never underestimate the power of a purpose-driven team and the culture they create.  \n 2022 offered more examples of Target teamwork than I can count, but two will stick with me for quite a while. 5 months ago when Hurricane Ian devastated communities across Florida, our team sprang into action. They didn't wait for me or Brian or anyone else on the leadership team to tell them what to do. Instead, they gathered input from those on the ground and told us what they needed. Pop-up resource centers that provided laundry, food, gas, restroom, showers and Wi-Fi-enabled laptops to 700 team members and their families. Extra inventory to stock local stores with essentials guests would need to weather the storm, and financial support, $5 million to fund local relief efforts and up to $3 million in matching donations to our team member giving fund, which provides assistance to team members affected by natural disasters.  \n It was about the same time that our inventory action plan was in full swing. You'll remember, we announced bold measures last summer to quickly take action to rightsize our inventory in response to shifting consumer demands. It was a big ask of our team, one that required them to move quickly and aggressively to reduce existing inventory and cut back on receipts for the back half of 2022. And the team responded as they always do with heart and hustle. They worked through 8 distribution centers worth of inventory in a matter of months, putting us in a strong position heading into the critical holiday season. That's our culture in action, bottom-up ingenuity centered on caring for our team and our guests. And it's that culture that fuels our strategy and growth.  \n For years now, we've shared our vision of using our stores as fulfillment hubs to get closer to our guests. It was an idea that was novel when we first introduced it, but it's been widely adopted as others expand their view of what stores can do. Now I'm an engineer to my core. So it gives me great satisfaction to see the way Target built our stores as hub strategy from the ground up and how our operating model gets stronger with each passing year. \n We don't have a rigid road map. Instead, we use a highly repeatable process to test concepts, refine them, test them again, until we can replicate them with confidence, efficiency and scale. And then and only then do we ask ourselves what's next? And how can we make this even better? And the whole process begins again.  \n Let's take Drive-Up. You can trace the origins of Drive-Up to the launch of our Store Pickup service a decade ago. It took a few years to get Store Pickup where we wanted and when we did, we were able to take it one step further with Drive-Up. We launched Drive-Up as a test in our Minneapolis market in 2017. By the following year, the service was available in more than 1,000 stores around the country, and it reached all 50 states in 2019.  \n With the foundation in place and operating at scale, we started to explore new capabilities. In 2020, we made fresh and frozen groceries available. In 2021, we added adult beverage and expanded our app to give guests a more customized experience. Last year, we began testing Starbucks at Drive-Up. And today, we're announcing the next phase of our Drive-Up services with Drive-Up Returns, which started as a pilot last year and will be available across the chain by the end of the summer.  \n Not only is this a huge win for our guests who can now do even more at Drive-Up, but it brings more efficiency to our returns process, with more resale opportunities and fewer expenses for mail-in returns. We're combining the strength of our digital self-service returns process with our industry-leading Drive-Up experience to meet our guests where they are.  \n This is what it means to be a truly omnichannel retailer, giving our guests the flexibility, ease and convenience to shop the way that works best for them and scaling capabilities across every facet of our business. Online, in-store, Drive-Up, it doesn't matter how they choose to shop with us. We're here to make their Target run better than ever.  \n Looking back, the evolution of Drive-Up may seem like it was a natural progression, easy to predict and implement. When you're bringing to market new ideas in an environment that is anything but stable, you have to be ready to adjust course and explore alternatives. Our team has gotten really good at moving in step with the needs of our guests. That flexibility and a commitment to the fundamentals that make or break a retailer, things like hiring the right people, offering the right products and delivering the right experiences to our guests, underpin our stores as hub strategy and contribute to our larger story of growth.  \n Same-day services like Drive-Up are a great example. They grew nearly 7% last year as more shoppers appreciate the convenience and speed with which they can check off everything on their list. And because we own our same-day capabilities, pickup and Drive-Up are much more economical and flexible than other forms of digital fulfillment. In fact, our average fulfillment cost per unit has come down 40% over the past 4 years as our same-day services have grown to account for over half of our digital sales.\n Again, these results don't happen overnight, and they aren't achieved in a vacuum. They are the product of steady investment and listening to our guests. Take our stores, which sit at the heart of our stores as hub strategy and play a dual role of shopping destination and fulfillment hub. Our stores are not only beautiful, with open floor design, plenty of natural light and design elements that reflect the communities they serve, they're built to keep inventory moving through our system and support Target's trajectory of growth.  \n Late last year, we introduced a new store prototype in Katy, Texas. From the front entrance to the back room, this 150,000 square foot store is a stunner. Beautiful design elements reflect the local environment and community. Features like natural refrigerants, electric vehicle charging stations and rooftop solar empower our Target Forward sustainability ambitions and get us closer to our goal of net zero emissions by 2040. And a backroom 5x bigger than our average store allows us to ramp up same-day fulfillment, while preserving a seamless experience for our guests and our team.  \n We plan to open about 20 stores this year in a mix of sizes, from the shores of the outer banks in North Carolina, to the heart of Inglewood, California. We're also planning to invest in about 175 stores throughout the year, ranging from full remodels to the addition of shop-in-shop experiences like Ulta Beauty and retrofitted fulfillment spaces to support our same-day services. Our ongoing investment in our suite of stores is just one way we're building for the future.  \n What might be less evident to our guests is how we're building facilities behind the scenes to make their experience even better. We've built upstream capacity by opening flow centers in Chicago and New Jersey, with several more slated to open over the next few years. And a new food distribution center that opened in Maryland this past October expand support for our growing food and beverage business. This additional capacity gives us more flexibility to manage inventory and keep our stores stocked with the items guests want when they want them.  \n We're also making investments downstream. Earlier this month, we announced the expansion of our sortation center network to more than 15 facilities by the end of 2026. These facilities have transformed how we move inventory with speed and precision to guests' doorsteps. We started with a prototype less than 2 years ago to see how we might bring more efficiency to how we sort, batch and route packages. Today, we have 9 sortation centers open across the country, allowing us to deliver packages to guests within 2 days. Up to 40% are delivered 1 day when using our last-mile delivery capabilities with Shipt. And because Shipt is fully integrated into our last-mile operations, we benefit from significantly lower delivery costs.  \n To give you a closer look at how these sortation centers have become core to our business, we ask leaders from Target and Shipt to give you a brief tour and talk about how our test and learn approach applies to last-mile delivery. Let's take a look. \n [Presentation] \nJohn Mulligan: As you heard from [ Dory ], [ Saad ] and [ Kamau ], we've learned a lot over the past few years, using every opportunity to improve speed, cost and quality. And in regards, our sortation centers are just hitting their stride. We delivered more than 25 million packages through sortation centers last year, and we expect to double that amount in 2023 with the help of our local and national carriers.  \n Together, the investments we're making create a more nimble sourcing, inventory management and fulfillment capability at Target, and they continue to help us navigate tough times, prepare for the unpredictable and fuel steady growth, all thanks to our incredible team. We've made huge strides in recent years to connect with our guests through our stores. The momentum continues to build, and I look forward to sharing progress with you and our guests in the quarters to come.  \n Michael, I'll turn it over to you. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. As Brian mentioned, it was exactly a year ago that we were on this stage, talking about our 2021 financial results, a year in which our business generated double-digit growth in comparable sales and even faster growth in EPS. And as Christina discussed, we knew on that day that the environment was likely to change, but we didn't yet know how dramatic those changes would be. The rapid pace of this transition led to multiple profit pressures on our business, including markdowns and other costs related to last year's inventory actions, significantly higher shipping and domestic transportation costs and higher inventory shrink.  \n So as we focus on our business plans, both for 2023 and the longer term, it's important to consider how the environment will continue to evolve. On the one hand, many things about life and consumer behavior already look a lot like they did before the pandemic. Students are back in school, sports arenas are full, people are eating out again and consumers are embracing in-store shopping.  \n At the other extreme, certain aspects of life appear to have changed forever. Many office jobs are now hybrid, with remote work and virtual meetings playing a much more significant role. That means many of us are spending a lot more time working at home, which has implications for long-term buying patterns in multiple categories, most notably our Food business.  \n Fulfillment mix has also seen a permanent shift. Our same-day services have seen explosive growth. They now account for more than half of our digital sales and more than 10% of our total sales. And that trend shows no signs of reversing. Even as people have remixed their trips in favor of in-store shopping, guest engagement with these digital services has continued to grow on top of the huge expansion that's occurred over the last few years.  \n Most importantly, our guests' overall engagement with Target has increased significantly over the last few years, and it continues to grow. Think about it this way. In 2021, guests made about 2 billion trips to Target, which was about 300 million higher than in 2019. And last year, even as consumer spending moved away from products into services, traffic grew again. The deeper relationship we've established with our guests and our proven ability to deepen it further are some of the many reasons we're so well positioned to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.  \n Beyond the factors that have changed permanently, there are several others that are clearly still in transition. These include transportation and the global supply chain, where we've already seen remarkable improvement, but we're still facing elevated costs and variability compared to the prepandemic period. Another factor is inventory shrink, which has increased broadly across U.S. retail over the past 2 years. And finally, the most significant and important driver of uncertainty today is the fact that the broad macro economy is still in transition, leading to an inflationary period, more pronounced than we've seen in decades.  \n As Christina mentioned, rapidly rising prices have put pressure on discretionary spending as consumers make room for higher prices on necessities. In addition, higher interest rates have further pressured budgets by increasing the cost of mortgages and car loans.  \n So where does that leave us today? Despite all of the recent turmoil and the pressures facing our business, we remain in a very strong position to drive healthy growth in the coming years. Our guests are more engaged than ever, and that engagement continued to grow even during a tumultuous year. And even after a year in which we experienced unique and unexpected headwinds to both our profitability and cash flow, our business is sound, it remains strong and we're laser-focused on the path forward.  \n In 2023, we'll focus first on agility and strong execution. Most notably, we'll take a cautious stance on our inventory commitments and markdown-sensitive categories, with the flexibility to sell into our base inventory and expand receipts over time. At the same time, we'll continue investing in our long-term strategic initiatives that propel our market share and profit growth, including our remodel program, our new store pipeline and projects to add replenishment capacity and increased efficiency in our supply chain. \n We'll also focus on strengthening our balance sheet. In 2022, our business was a net user of cash for the first time in many years. This was driven by a host of unique factors, including unexpectedly low profitability, higher-than-expected CapEx driven by inflation and project costs and a rapid slowdown in inventory turns due to excess inventory and longer lead times in global shipping. \n This year, we expect each of those factors to become more favorable. More specifically, we're expecting an increase in profit dollars and a somewhat slower pace of CapEx. And given our cautious inventory positioning and rapidly improving lead times in global shipping, we're planning for faster inventory turns in 2023, driving higher payables leverage and recovery in working capital as we move through the year.  \n In the near term, until those expectations play out and our cash generation increases, we're not planning to repurchase any shares, consistent with our goal to maintain our middle A credit ratings. Over time, as our cash flow recovers and our debt metrics improve, we expect share repurchases will play a meaningful role within our broader, long-term capital deployment priorities. But as always, those repurchases will only occur after we fully invested in our business and supported our team, after we've supported our dividend goals and within the limits of our middle A ratings.  \n Now I want to share some thoughts on our 2023 outlook, and I'll start with our expectations for the first quarter. Given the current conditions we're facing, we expect our business to generate first quarter comparable sales in a wide range, from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase. This reflects our expectation for continued strength in our frequency businesses, offset by softness in discretionary categories.  \n On the operating income line, we're expecting a first quarter rate in the 4% to 5% range, higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter, but down somewhat from the 5.3% our business generated in last year's first quarter. While there are a number of factors driving this expectation, I'd note that our first quarter SG&A expense rate is expected to be about 1 percentage point higher than a year ago, reflecting continued investments in our team and guest experience, without an expected leverage benefit from higher sales. Altogether, on the bottom line, we expect our business to generate first quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.50 to $1.90.  \n Now I'll turn to our full year expectations, and I'll first note that the range of potential outcomes gets wider as the year goes on, given the high degree of uncertainty regarding the strength of the economy and the consumer. Given this uncertainty, we firmly believe caution is the appropriate posture, especially when planning sales and inventory in discretionary categories.  \n On the frequency side of the business, our full year plans envision continued share gains and strong sales growth. But we're mindful that inflation in these categories may begin to moderate, pressuring dollar comps across the industry. In light of those considerations, along with our outlook for discretionary categories, we're planning for the same wide range on the top line that we're planning for the first quarter, from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase in our comparable sales.  \n In terms of profitability, the range of potential outcomes is similarly wide. As I mentioned earlier, we're positioned to benefit from a number of significant tailwinds on the gross margin line, most notably as we cycle over last year's inventory actions. In addition, we're expecting hundreds of millions of dollars of additional opportunity from lapping last year's unusually high freight and transportation costs.  \n At the same time, we're also preparing for some notable headwinds on the gross margin line. These include inventory shrink, which may continue to rise before we see rates begin to moderate over time. We're also expecting some pressure from soft sales in our highest-margin discretionary categories. And finally, we see the potential for increased promotional intensity across the industry this year, given that we're competing in a constrained environment for consumer spending.  \n On the SG&A line this year, we expect continued strong discipline in managing costs across the enterprise, but we're also not backing away from investments in our team and guest experience, and we'll face potential rate deleverage given our outlook for comparable sales.\n In light of these considerations, we're planning for a wide range of potential outcomes for our full year operating income. But even at the low end of those expectations, we expect to grow our operating income by more than $1 billion this year. Altogether, our expectations translate to a full year GAAP and adjusted EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75, which represents growth of about $1.75 per share at the low end of the range.  \n On the CapEx line this year, we're expecting to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion. While this range is somewhat lower than last year's CapEx, it's quite strong relative to our history. This year's plan reflects the optimal level to invest in the current environment and our expectation that we'll continue to earn high returns on our long-term growth investments, including our remodel program and new store pipeline and our continued work to build capacity and capabilities in our supply chain.  \n As we think about the longer-term trajectory of our business, we expect that as external conditions normalize in the next several years, our operating income margin rate should reach and begin to move beyond our prepandemic rate of 6%. This return to prepandemic levels could happen as early as 2024, depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand.  \n I want to pause and emphasize that this year's guidance does not reflect how we expect our business to perform over the longer term. Once we see a normalization of consumer demand and a resumption of growth in discretionary categories, you'll see that reflected in a stronger top line performance and a meaningful increase in our operating margin rate beyond what we're planning for this year.  \n I also want to reiterate something we've said many times. While we often talk about rates because it's helpful for analytical purposes, our goal is to find the optimal rate that maximizes profit dollar growth over time. In other words, we'll continue to focus simultaneously on top line growth and the rate we earn on it without focusing on either metric and isolation.  \n So now before I invite Brian and Mike O'Neil to join me on stage, I want to pause and thank our team for their continued optimism and resilience through a turbulent year. Last year presented a host of unexpected and unprecedented challenges that all seemed to arrive at once. Through it all, our team maintained a long-term focus, serving our guests and taking care of each other.  \n As a result, we saw continued expansion in guest traffic and engagement throughout the year and historically strong hiring and retention metrics across our team. Those are some of the most important factors in determining our long-term success and why I feel so confident about Target's potential in the years ahead.  \n Now I'd like to invite Brian and Mike O'Neil to join me on stage so we can have a brief conversation about the enterprise efficiency work we've asked Mike to lead. \nBrian Cornell: Well, Michael, thank you, and Mike, thanks for joining us today. I know everyone would like to get into the work, but I think it would be really helpful to just pause for a second and talk about your background and why we selected you to lead this very important initiative. \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Really happy to be here and excited about the opportunity to lead this work for Target. I've been at Target now for 15-plus years, started in finance, worked in various roles with our merchandising operation partners to help deliver on their strategic priorities and their financial growth. Through that experience, I got to see the business model through the lens of the P&L. \n A couple of years ago, I went over then to human resources and led our pay and benefits and strategic workforce planning teams. And that was a great opportunity to see the business through the lens of our team members. I had a chance to lead that team during the early days of the pandemic and saw quickly the work our team does to take -- the importance of taking care of them to take care of our guests.  \n From there, I've been back now in finance for a couple of years, and was leading the financial planning and analysis teams where we work with every business function to deliver on both our finance and strategic priorities. And coming back to finance and seeing the growth we've seen over the last couple of years, it was pretty apparent to me the opportunity to step back and think about how do we run this business model now at the larger scale. And so I think with those experiences, plus the relationships I've built over these 15 years, I think, position me well to lead this work forward. \nMichael Fiddelke: Mike, when you took on this role, we spent a lot of time talking about what this work's about and what it isn't. Can you share a bit about the reasons we've initiated the work and what we're looking to accomplish? \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Yes. I think I'll start maybe with what it isn't. This isn't about sacrificing long-term growth for short-term profits. A typical tactic here is to look to shrink your cost base in the face of declining revenues. Well, that's not Target, right? We are growing, continue to grow. In fact, this work has come out from the growth we've seen over the last 3 years. We've grown $30 billion -- over $30 billion since 2019. That's more than 14 years prior. And that creates a tremendous opportunity to step back and reimagine how do we operate this business at a larger scale, but more importantly, how do we position Target for future growth.\n And so as we're looking for efficiencies, we'll look for ways to simplify the work, to streamline processes, to reduce redundancy, all with the mind of how do we make it easier for our team members to deliver a great guest experience. In doing so, our initial scoping says, we'll deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of cost savings over the next 3 years. \nMichael Fiddelke: Mike, I want to clarify one thing briefly. After Brian and I mentioned this effort in our last earnings call, we got some questions about whether that $2 billion to $3 billion number includes the natural recovery from the headwinds we experienced in 2022. Can you help clarify that? \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Sure. I've got a couple of those questions as well. And I would say, I reiterate that this is not about the work over -- or what's happened to us over the last 12 months. It's about the growth that we've seen over the last 3 years. And so no, what's not included is anything that will come, the natural recovery from the headwinds of last year. This work is the designed to deliver fuel beyond that, both to deliver on our -- both our top line and our bottom line goals. \nBrian Cornell: Mike, when we asked you to lead this project, we spent a lot of time thinking about the guardrails. Now obviously, there's big opportunities that we want to capture. But there's also things we never want to compromise. Do you want to talk about the opportunities versus the guardrail of let's say, \"We'll never head in this direction?\" \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Yes, I think that's a really important question. And the things we're not willing to sacrifice start with a team member and the guest experience. We're not going to take away anything given the investments we've made in our team over the last couple of years, and spending that time in human resources during those early days of the pandemic had an appreciation for all our team did to run our business and to serve our guests. And so I look at our team members and the investments we make as an investment in the best team in retail. \n Similarly, on the guest side, our shopping experience is a key differentiator for Target, and we're not looking at anything to take away from that. In fact, our guiding principle around this work is, how do you make it easier for our team members to run our business and in doing so, deliver a great guest experience? And so we do that, we think we'll see benefits to both the team and our guests. \nMichael Fiddelke: Mike, since we first announced this work, I've had a bunch of investors ask me where they should expect to see the results of this work show up in the P&L? Can you share your initial thoughts? \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Sure. I think it's -- you're going to see it across the full P&L. So I'm not sure you're going to be isolating it to one single component. What excites me about this work, though, as we think about running the different scale, I think there's top line opportunity. And so it's going to start with sales. Now we're not going to do anything against the -- we're going to continue to invest in our team, but any efficiency work will have SG&A impact on the SG&A line. And product costs continue to be our biggest line item on the P&L, so we'll see it there as well. But I also will say it'll expand beyond the P&L as we look to be more efficient in our CapEx. \nBrian Cornell: So Mike, I know you're still in the early stages of scoping the work, but there's also things that we've been working on for quite some time now that we can build on. Do you want to highlight some of those? \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Sure. We touched base on a lot this morning that work around digital fulfillment, I think, is a great example. We've been -- that work in several years underway, when you think about our stores as hub model, has significantly decreased our fulfillment cost. John mentioned 40% over 3 years.  \n We've also been able to increase speed of delivery and improved the guest experience across all those different nodes, whether that's ship-to-home, Drive-Up, Order Pick up or Shipt delivery, and it's extremely capital efficient.\n If you look forward now, we think there's hundreds of million dollars to continue to unlock with our investment in sortation centers. That's a business -- that's a capability that's been on our road map for a few years now, but requires scale and density at the market level to unlock. And given the growth over the last 3 years, we now have that.\n And so we think there's opportunity in a dozen of metro markets. We already have 9 facilities out there and plan to have a total of 15 by 2026. And so we'll open those up, but also we'll make those centers more efficient as well as we think about streamlining processes in them and looking to introduce automation and technology. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, Mike. Can you also provide an example of a newer effort you're excited about? \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Yes. I think the best example is the work that's underway now in Apparel. This one is near and dear to my heart. My first role at Target was the finance partner for our women's apparel business. I also think it serves as a really great example of what is possible with this work. Apparel, just like the rest of our business, has seen explosive growth. We've grown over $3 billion and now a over $17 billion business in Apparel business. It also has its unique complexities, right, from the fact that we partner with vendors to source raw materials, to the fact that we have unique fixtures in store for presentation. So all the geographical and weather and demographic considerations that go into assortment planning and allocation. \n And so that growth, combined with that complexity, makes a tremendous opportunity to step back and say, how do we run this business at a larger scale and how do we position it for future growth? And so we're focused right now on driving simplicity, speed and consistency across the entire pair of value chain. And in doing so, we expect to see benefits from assortment planning, to supply chain, all the way down to guest fulfillment.  \n And the benefits will be across the P&L. We'll see it in lower markdowns, we'll see it in increased productivity -- labor productivity, and we'll see it in top line sales. And so I love that example because it gives you a chance to step back and say, look, we've seen this growth over the last 3 years. How do we look end-to-end across the value chain to position it differently? How do we simplify for the work for our guests? And in doing so, we believe we'll see benefits across the P&L with the most important one being top line sales. \nBrian Cornell: So Mike, I love the way you framed this up. This is all about fueling future growth, driving simplicity, reducing complexity, never compromising the guest experience and the role our teams play. Are there any other components as you think about this, that you want to touch upon? \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Well, I'd say thanks for letting me come up to share just a couple of examples. I would say -- I'd reiterate is this starts with growth. It starts about how do we make it simple and easier for our team members to deliver a great experience. And that work is going to be a multiyear journey, and this will require end-to-end problem solving across the value chain. But when we do that, we focus on making a better team member experience. We'll see a better impact to our team, our guests and our P&L. \nBrian Cornell: Well, Mike, I want to thank you for joining us on stage here today. We're really excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. You've heard a few examples today, and we'll continue to provide updates along the way. \n So Mike, thank you for joining us. \nMichael O\u2019Neil: Thanks, Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, I'll have you back here in a second. \nMichael Fiddelke: Great. \nBrian Cornell: So as we get ready to hear from you and take your questions, I thought I'd briefly recap some of the themes you've heard today. First, our commitment to our guests is as strong as ever. Second, our strategy, our multi-category portfolio, our stores as hub model will provide the flexibility we need to keep growing because we're going to stay closely connected to our guests. Finally, there have been some fundamental changes at Target over the last 3 years. We're more than $30 billion bigger. We set the omnichannel standard with stores as hubs. We'll continue to build and innovate in that realm. We'll set the pace in supporting and developing the very best team in retail. \n Perhaps the most important takeaway is something that hasn't changed, and that's our ability to shift our business and our categories in step with our guests. If they need to prioritize food and essentials, we'll lean into those categories. But as you heard from Christina, in a year when discretionary spending was down, our discretionary categories generated $55 billion in sales. Our guests today are responding to newness. They're celebrating seasons as we just saw with Valentine's Day. They're eager to be out in our stores and enjoying that guest experience, and we're seeing it in our traffic growth. And we know they really value affordable joy. \n So we remain fully committed to our multi-category portfolio, to essentials and to our discretionary categories. And as our guests lean back in discretionary categories over time, we'll be ready to flex into those trends, building substantially on the near-term plans we share today. \n We know that will happen. But in the meantime, we're moving forward thoughtfully. We're doubling down on retail fundamentals. We're finding fuel for further growth through efficiency. And while we're emphasizing prudence in our near-term performance, I am incredibly positive about the long-term potential and our ability to translate both into positive outcomes for all stakeholders, including shareholder returns over time. \n So I want to close by thanking our team as they tune in from around the globe, and thanking all of you for staying with us on this journey. \n And with that, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to come back, and we'll open it up for your questions. \nBrian Cornell: All right. I see hands already going up. We've got paddle runners around the room. As I call on you, I might ask you just to pause, introduce yourself and ask your question. So why don't we start right here. Michael? \nMichael Lasser: It's Michael Lasser from UBS. A few questions. Number one, last year at this meeting, you had talked about an 8% operating margin. So what has changed this year to -- last year to this year structurally with the business to make it a lower operating margin business?\n Two, what is it going to take to get to the 6% operating margin by next year? And third, Brian, sorry, did you look at the experience over the last few quarters and say, hey, we missed what we expected it to do. So let's take a more conservative, cautious view on how we're planning this year, leaving potential room for upside? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, why don't I ask you to start, and then I'll come back and answer the back half of that question. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. So we've got a journey in front of us on the profit front, and 2023 plays an important role in stepping back to where we expect to get over time. When we guided to a wide range today, even at the low end, we expect over $1 billion in net income growth year-over-year. And we want to execute that plan, that's first and foremost. Under the right set of conditions, we think we can get to 6% in 2024. And then we'll take it from there. But we've got the next couple of years squarely in focus because we've got work to do to recover our performance from last year.\n As we think about what's optimal over time, I'll go back to what I said in remarks, we want the optimal rate that maximizes profit dollar growth over time. And I think there's still a few variables that will click into place between now and when we have that conversation in the quarters and months to come. But we want to be focused on dollars, in dollar growth, philosophically, that's the thing that we'd leave the group with today. \nBrian Cornell: And Michael, back to lessons learned from last year. We've used the term uncertainty quite a bit today. We recognized last year that the consumer trends move very quickly. And one of the things I'm most proud of is the way this leadership team embraced the challenge, took it head on, made the adjustments in our inventory and protected the guest experience. That's why we continue to see traffic growth and unit share gains across our portfolio and why we're so well positioned today for 2023 with overall inventory down 3%, but importantly, discretionary inventory down 13%. \n So lessons learned for us, but I'm incredibly proud of the way this team dealt with that issue upfront, protected our team, protected our guests and position us for the long term. \n Why don't we go over on this side. \nPaul Lejuez: Paul Lejuez, Citigroup. A couple of questions on Drive-Up returns. Curious what percent of your returns are done at store? Also what is your typical attach rate? When you get somebody in a store that would return an item, do you also convert them to sales? Is there a risk that you might give up that opportunity? And then second, just high level, free cash flow. Once you get through all the working capital changes in F '23, what does free cash flow look like in your view for this upcoming year? \nBrian Cornell: All right. So several questions to answer there. John, I might ask you to start and explain why we're so excited about the changes we're making with returns through Drive-Up. And then Michael, we can talk about the second part of the question. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. The majority of returns come back to store, but a meaningful portion are still shipped back to us. So that's not insignificant. As it relates to your -- the second part of your question around attach rate, and this is the question when we started Order Pick Up and when we started Drive-Up. And to us, that's respectfully not an important consideration.\n What is important is allow the guests to interact with us how they choose. And at every step when they see us -- when we see them jump into Drive-Up, when we see them use Shipt, when they -- we see them use Pick Up, their engagement with Target increases, not just digitally, but also in-store, and that becomes a better guest for Target. The best guest set for Target are the ones that interact with all of our various ways of interacting with them.\n And so this provides them another opportunity to create ease. You've got your kid in the back. I need some milk and I got to return this, whatever, at Target. I put that in my trunk. I show up. They bring the milk, they take that away and I'm off on my day again. And then on Saturday, we'll come in and do the stock-up trip and that will be great. So our approach is just to continue to lean into where they want us to go. \n Top two feedback things on Drive-Up, why can't I get my coffee? Why can't I get a Starbucks? And why can't I return something? And so we're still working on the Starbucks, but we're ready for returns. And again, if we listen to the guests, they'll engage with us. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. John, I think one of the things we've learned over the last 3 years, and we watched it carefully as we expanded Drive-Up and Pick Up and started delivering right to your home with Shipt, we said, all right, is this going to impact the guest engagement in store? It's quite the opposite. As guests use all of our capabilities, they actually spend more dollars in-store and just reward us with more trips. So it's been an important learning that we'll build on. And I think we'll just deepen that engagement as we give them another easy solution for returns. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Just -- at risk of piling on. We care about economics at the transaction level. We care about the economics at the category level. We care about the economics at the fulfillment path. But the thing that we thought differently about over time is cutting the economics by guests. When we take friction out of the process and make it easier for guests to just fall more and more in love with Target, that's the most powerful economic relationship to be focused on. I think we've learned that time and time again, and Drive-Up is a perfect example. \n On the free cash flow question, we're not guiding to free cash flow specifically, but we expect material improvement from a free cash flow basis. And I touched on some of the drivers. The first is better profitability. The second is we expect working capital recovery. I mean our turns slowed, our supply chain times were longer this year and that came with working capital investments to make sure we're getting product here early enough with a volatile supply chain. And so we were running at suboptimal working capital levels through the bulk of 2022. As we move through 2023, I would expect that to improve. \nBrian Cornell: I think I see a hand up right in this first row. In fact, quite a few. We'll start right in the middle. \nSimeon Gutman: Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. You mentioned that fulfillment costs, I think, on digital are down 40% since 2019. Is there any merit to the fact that you're a $110 billion sales organization and that you've suddenly become less efficient such that this path back to 6% requires investments? And so the ultimate question is how much of getting back is the pure recapture of lapping markdowns, freight costs, shrink versus how much you have to invest to get back to that level? \nBrian Cornell: Yes, I'm happy to start. It's a piece of both. We've seen some structural changes in the business. We talked about shrink as being one, and that's not one that we expect to turn in a different direction quickly. But the efficiency we've been able to drive, given how efficient stores are as a fulfillment hub is a huge advantage to us when it comes to digital fulfillment. It's fast for the guest, the economics of it work for us and we build engagement like we talked about before.\n Separately, we continue to be focused, as Mike shared, on the efficiency work. And that's important work. We want fuel from efficiency, to keep investing in growth of the business. And that will also play a role in getting us to the right profit outcome that we should have as a $100-plus billion retailer. \n Go ahead, Mike. \nMichael Fiddelke: Sorry, Brian. I'd add on as it relates to capacity, particularly because you brought up fulfillment, we've seen our sales productivity in the store increase by 37% over the last 3 years, Brian mentioned that. We still have -- so an average store has gone, call it from $40 million to $55 million over the last 3 years. We still have stores that do over $100 million and do well over $100 million. The top quartile does significantly more than the median store.\n So we have tons of capacity sitting out there unused in our stores and the ability to turn faster, again, back to we need to improve how we move inventory and how quickly we move inventory, which we're on the journey on, but our stores have significant capacity to continue to drive both in-store sales and our digital business. \nBrian Cornell: Why don't we go in the back? \nUnknown Analyst: Brian, I'd like to talk a little bit about the trade down impacts you're seeing. Are you a net gainer or donor on the trade down? And to the extent you are losing some share there, do you have -- does your customer database allow you to adopt win-back strategies targeted to those people who may have traded out? \nBrian Cornell: Okay. Christina, do you want to talk about what we're seeing as far as guest shopping behavior? \nA. Hennington: Yes, happy to. First of all, over the last couple of years, we've gained a tremendous amount of new guests into the Target ecosystem. And so our focus right now has been to deepen our engagement with the guests. Of course, we always want more guests, but the opportunity in front of us is much more to convert them into using the suite of capabilities because they become much more loyal. They understand the Target value proposition more deeply once they experience the ease and convenience of Drive-Up or once they recognized what an incredible food and beverage offering we have. And so that's our primary focus right now. \n When we talk about trade down, those are words that are used in many different facets. Sometimes it's used internally in talking about private label. For us, we talk about owned brands rather than private label because these are brands we've invested in for years. We build them, design them, create the packaging, the marketing materials, and they're hugely important to our strategy. \n And so in that sense, we never think about it as trade down. We think about it as trade in. It creates more options for people to use and engage with our portfolio because it tends to be the same great quality at incredible price points. And so the growth of our owned brand strategy would reflect significant potential in the future based on the success we've had in the past. \n So right now, our focus is to make sure our guests are aware of what we have and create a better, less frictionless experience, make sure that we deepen the loyalty with the consumer. \nBrian Cornell: Right. Moving right here. \nGregory Melich: Right. Maybe I'll just -- I'll jump in. Greg Melich. I got the mic. I'll just do it. \nBrian Cornell: You got the mic. The power of the mic, Greg. \nGregory Melich: Really two questions. John, maybe -- well, maybe, Michael, if you could help us on some of the other margin drivers that you see, particularly shrink, you called out is still a headwind. What do you do to actually fix that? I'm also thinking credit profitability now that some of the delinquency rates and other charges are changing.\n And then maybe bigger picture, Brian, how important is keeping traffic? You've gained so much traffic and customer engagement. How do you think about pulling that lever versus promotion and margin and expect more, pay less? Is it critical that traffic keeps growing no matter what? Or could it slip 1% or 2% just given your mix? How do you think about pulling those levers as we go through this uncertain year or 2? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, why don't I start with the focus on traffic. And as we sit here today, and you've heard me talk about this for years and years now, we think one of the most important indicator of a retailer's health is the traffic indicator. And that's why we feel so good about the fact that we've had 23 consecutive quarters where we've seen comp store sales growth, and it's all on the back of traffic. We're getting more footsteps into our stores, more visits to our site, greater engagement. Our guests are spending more with us. They are rewarding us with more trips and they're shopping more categories. And we think that's critically important. \n To John's point, while we've seen a significant lift over the last few years in our sales per square foot, we know there's still potential to go further. And as we think about capabilities like Target Circle, our ability to connect with those guests and deepen their relationship, introduce them to newness in our assortment in other categories, we think we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us.\n But sitting here today, I continue to believe looking at trips is critically important. And in an inflationary environment that we're working in today, it's why we're so laser-focused on unit share improvement because those things are going to be really important as we move to a more normalized environment, because the guest is turning to us more frequently for all of their needs, both frequency and discretionary. They're shopping more categories. So making sure we're looking at units carefully, looking at trips to me is a key indicator of the health of our business today and why we're so excited about the potential in front of us. \nJohn Mulligan: And maybe for the second part of your question, Greg, when it comes to margin and profitability in general, it starts with what Brian did. The strength of the top line is going to matter a lot and we feel encouraged by the traffic trends that we've seen. \n In terms of the other structural buckets, you hit on a few of them. We talked about shrink. We've seen a normalization in some of the credit metrics we watch, I think consistent with what you'd see in the industry. I wouldn't put that highest on the list of factors for next year, but it's one we'll stay close to and monitor. \n We've also talked and some of what we covered earlier today, we expect a promotional environment next year. We see guests responding to promotion in the fourth quarter, and we expect that, that's something that could continue. We'll also have some tailwinds on the margin side though. I mean we're anniversary-ing a level of markdowns in salvage that was extremely typical for us, and we want to make sure we recover that. We've seen some improvement in supply chain and freight. And so as we anniversary some of the peaks from last year, that should be a good guy on the margin line. And so it's all of those variables that we factored into the guidance we gave today. \nBrian Cornell: Okay. Why don't we go back there. \nIvan Feinseth: Ivan Feinseth, Tigress Financial Partners. I have two questions. Could you go into some detail on how Roundel contributes to revenue growth? What percentage of your vendors are on it? And how you demonstrate your value proposition to them? \n And then my second question, this morning on your interview on CNBC, you spoke about your strength in toys and your growth in home goods. What other category opportunities do you see that, going forward, you could lever and become a retailer of choice in those categories? \nBrian Cornell: Right. Well, Christina, I'll let you talk a bit about Roundel and just how important it's been for our vendor partners and deepening engagement. But the second question is something we talk about all the time. And sitting here today, you and I both know, while we have built great momentum and added over $30 billion of growth, we know we still have category opportunities all around us. \nA. Hennington: Yes. So first, Roundel, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is an incredibly important part of our ecosystem. It gives our vendors an opportunity to target the guests that they see as most likely to be intrigued by their new products and the quality of merchandise that they're bringing to market. It allows us to highlight those products and give them real-time insights about how it's selling because of the closed loop reporting that we can offer. \n And so this has been a huge part of the demand generation for a lot of our businesses. We are very engaged with a broad spectrum of vendors across the entirety of the portfolio, and believe that Roundel is going to be an important part of the future, partly because of that guest-centricity that we bring to the model, but also because our guests want to know what's new and relevant, both across owned brands and national brands and how it fits into their lives. \n So maybe I can pivot to that second question and really talk about what opportunities we have. Well, we have a broad portfolio. And we think the strength of our multi-category portfolio is a differentiator in the market. We don't build an assortment for a snapshot in time. So having a healthy business across every dimension, allows us to flex as market conditions change. \n Right now, we're flexing into Essentials & Beauty and Food & Beverage. But a couple of years ago, it was Home and Hardlines that took the center stage. So having the ability to connect with consumers and having relevance and strong market share positions in many businesses is important to us. The way that we continue to build relevance is by staying super guest-centric, working to make sure that we are a destination for seasonal businesses. Seasonal businesses are kind of in our core DNA because it's a great way for guests to do more in one store at one time. Everything you need for back-to-school. You can get your backpack. You can get your calculator. You can get your pens and paper. You can get your new outfit. \n So those are really important to us, but the other is the importance of newness. And you heard me talk a lot about that. They're in an environment where consumers are making trade-offs. More of the same is not going to get it done. And so really investing in innovation and something that excites them, like our Apparel floor pad right now, if you haven't been in our stores or on our site lately, go check it out. The colors, the styles, the aesthetics are right on and it's absolutely grabbing the attention of our guests. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. I want to go back to the heart of your question. Do we have opportunities to continue to grow share? And it's something that Michael and I talked to many of you about all the time. Despite the growth we've seen over the last few years, adding well over $30 billion of top line growth, sitting here today, we represent 3% of the retail market. So as a leadership team, we see opportunities to grow across our entire multi-category portfolio, continue to leverage growth in store and from a digital standpoint. \n So while we've seen tremendous progress and we're proud of the way we've transformed the business, we still see a significant runway to take share across every one of our major categories going forward, leveraging that great in-store guest experience and the digital experience we offer, that great combination of inspiration and ease that makes Target such a great destination for guests across the country. So we see tremendous opportunities for years to come to continue to bolster our share position.\n Let's come back to the front row. I know your hands have been up for a while. \nEdward Yruma: Ed Yruma from Piper Sandler. It sounds like Beauty has been a real strong category for you. Can you click down a little bit more on Ulta, maybe the difference in performance there versus non-Ulta stores? And maybe why not move faster? And then just as a quick follow-up on the $2 billion to $3 billion in efficiency gains, do you have any of that baked into '23? \nBrian Cornell: Christina, you want to start and talk about Beauty? And then Michael, we can talk about '23. \nA. Hennington: Yes. First and foremost, Beauty at Target has been a success story for a number of years. We have an incredible assortment that's been relevant for a while. But adding Ulta Beauty has completed our assortment. Our ability to offer prestige products in our store with a servicing experience and expertise that Ulta has brought to the table has been the missing link. And so we've completed that picture. \n And so really excited about the performance, really excited about our partnership and we're looking to accelerate. We're already at 350 stores, and we'll add more, as John talked about, as part of our remodel program. So really bullish about the future there. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Ed, you and I actually walked a store recently. And I think you heard from our local team, the fact that very excited about the results we're seeing with Ulta Beauty and it's clearly driving even more traffic to Target. But at the same time, that team talked to you about the fact that our core beauty assortment continues to grow. So they're complementing each other, and we're just becoming more and more destination for that beauty shopper. \nMichael Fiddelke: On the $2 billion to $3 billion, there's a piece of that, that shows up in 2023. But a large chunk of that is multiyear in nature. And you think about the apparel example that Mike shared, I think that's just a perfect example. That's a business that grew so fast over the last few years and our teams did an amazing job to protect the good guest experience as we grew. \n But when we step back and look end-to-end across a business like apparel, we just see how much opportunity to simplify. Make things easier for the guests. Make things easier for our team. And changing some of those core processes won't happen overnight. That's why the multiyear nature is important. But we expect those benefits to be significant. \nBrian Cornell: Great. Let's go to this paddle right here. \nChristopher Horvers: Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. So my first question is you sit at these apex of different general merchandise categories that were major COVID winners. So as you peel away and look at the unit trends that you saw in the fourth quarter, are there signs of any stability, whether it's TVs or computing or decorative home or athleisure? Is there anything that has given you some encouragement to say like maybe we're getting to the bottom of the curve? \n And then my second question is around the first quarter operating margin guide versus what's implied for the fiscal year. It doesn't look like the implied is maybe like 4.5 to 5 on the fiscal year. It's not much better than the midpoint of the first quarter but yet, they're bigger quarters. You're going to lap all these headwinds from the freight side, which should be coming down, the markdowns, the salvaging. So why isn't -- and presumably consumables inflation comes down so that relative performance improves, why wouldn't you see better operating margin performance over the year relative to 1Q? \nBrian Cornell: Christina, you want to unpack some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories? \nA. Hennington: Yes. The most consistent theme is where there's innovation, there's still relevance. And so consumers are finding them. Social media, of course, is a great way for consumers to become connected to new products and new ideas, and you'll be surprised things will spike quickly. \n And sometimes we don't see them coming. In other times, we're well prepared. But I would tell you that there are pockets of those in every business. And so right now, we're planning the discretionary categories at an aggregate level more cautiously, but we're certainly leaning into market share opportunities where we see them. We believe that there's opportunity in the Home business, and we'll be launching more brands in the back half of this year, both on the national and owned brand side that have the potential to grow share in that category. \n We're seeing it definitely in Apparel, where you get the right fashion moment and the right fashion trend. It doesn't matter that they bought a lot of performance wear over the last couple of years, they're still interested in buying new. And so that's been the most consistent correlation. \n With that said, we're also introducing that level of newness and interest in categories like Food & Beverage and Essentials. Our favorite day brand that we've launched over the last couple of years, was a -- which is a sweets brand, has been -- has seen explosive growth over the last year or 2. And this is a place where we've taken the liberty to innovate in basic categories, whether it's cookies or ice cream and so forth, and the flavor profiles, the way that they brought the items to market have really shown that the guests will engage across the board if we give them a reason to. \nBrian Cornell: Chris, if we go back to discretionary categories. You heard us talk today, Christina highlighted the fact that in 2022, despite some of the softening trends, we still generated $55 billion of revenue in discretionary categories. One of the things I highlighted this morning during my CNBC interview is I go back to 2019. We've grown our discretionary portfolio by almost $14 billion. \n So we're going to move forward from a much bigger base and much more relevance in those categories. And to Christina's point, we know they are going to return to growth over time It's going to be led by newness and innovation in the near term. But we're in a much different position going forward than we were prepandemic. And I think we have much more relevance and credibility in the space than ever before. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. I think we're both at, what, 20 years or so at Target, Christina? We've seen ebbs and flows across the categories in our assortment over that time. And to us, the long-term winners will be the ones that build engagement in the moment now. That's why we're so focused on traffic. Apparel and Home will have their time in the sun again, and we'll be well positioned when they do. \n On the first quarter versus the balance of the year, I think I'd go back to just some of the broader themes. I think the biggest variable, that's a tough one for any of us to predict right now, it's just what's the path of the consumer during the year. We planned the first quarter reflective and mindful of the discretionary trends that we saw in the fourth quarter. And we'll learn a lot, I think, together as we move through the year, and that will inform what the balance of the year plays out at. But we think an appropriately cautious approach based on the trends we've seen is the right place to start and we'll unpack it as the year progresses. \nBrian Cornell: I'm trying to scan through the room to see hands that have been up for a while that we haven't gotten to. Let's come back over here. \nKaren Short: Karen Short from Credit Suisse. So a couple of questions I wanted to ask. We know what your tail -- or headwinds were for '22 in terms of dollars. You're at kind of the $1 billion-plus mark. And obviously, we know what you're guiding to on operating profit dollars for this year. \n But I guess the question that I would have is, it seems like maybe you've set a low bar. And so the real question is, if there's upside to the top line. Is that something you would choose to flow down to the bottom line? Or would you be more inclined to lean into continuing to, I guess, invest to maintain that kind of 5-plus percent operating margin for '23? \n And then the second question I would have is just on the $2 billion to $3 billion, if you could just give a little bit more on the buckets of where those are coming from? And then it sounds like there's some capture in '23, but most of it is '24 and beyond? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. It's a good question, Karen. And I guess I'd go back to just kind of philosophically how we think about the business. We're in the maximizing dollars business. And so we'd read and react through this year to make the right choices that we think maximize profit dollars both for 2023 and position us well for beyond. \n I'd love nothing more than in the quarters to come and to say, gosh, some trends played out stronger. The consumer was stronger in the back half of the year than maybe we thought. And if that's the case, then we'd happily have that conversation and be thrilled to outperform. \n But I think the reality is, as we sit at the start of the year, it's an uncertain environment. And we want to plan cautiously in that. And that isn't just kind of on paper caution, that's making sure that we're positioning the business right. It was important to start the year clean from an inventory perspective. We feel like we've accomplished that goal. And we'd like to lean appropriately cautiously in our inventory buys in the discretionary categories with a ton of flexibility to react if things would turn out better, but we think that's prudent for the volatility that we see right now. \nBrian Cornell: All right. Looks like we've got time for one more question. I see a paddle up in the back. \nPeter Benedict: Great. Pressure is on here. Peter Benedict at Baird. I guess first question would be on gross margin, down a little more than 500 basis points since 2019. Assuming mix doesn't get any better the next couple of years, just curious, Michael, how you think about the recapture of a portion of that? Where are the opportunities there? What would you think? Again, without mix getting dramatically better.\n And then my second question would just be, in the event that sales this year end up tougher than expected, your confidence in your ability to deliver still that $1 billion of improvement in EBIT, how much flexibility are you thinking on that front? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Maybe I'll do those in reverse. The wide range of guidance that we gave today is reflective of the scenarios that we envision right now. And so we feel good about the line we've drawn in the sand with that guidance now and we'll get a lot smarter together as the year plays out. \n When it comes to margin opportunities, we've talked about a lot of them already, but maybe one I would add to the list, just as a for example, is to link some of what Christina talked about with Target Circle and how valuable it is for us to be able to interact with our guests in a more individualized way. And that translates to good news on the top line, and we can make the right offer or the right message show up for the right guest at the right time. \n It should also translate to efficiency on our markdowns as we get more efficient with personalized promotions. We've learned over time that a personalized promotion has a higher return than a mass promotion. And so Circle gives us the opportunity to do even more of that better in the years to come. \n And so there's a lot of macro puts and takes, no doubt, as we unpack margin in the years to come, but there's also some important things that we're driving within the business that you know. \nBrian Cornell: Right. So with that, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I know we'll see many of you throughout the year, and I hope to see all of you back here at the Time Center next year. So thanks for joining us. Get home safe.",

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Despite the challenges of the past year, Target's differentiated position in retail has never been stronger. With a great assortment, compelling value, an unmatched suite of fulfillment options and a joyful shopping experience, Target continues to drive preference with American shoppers in the face of a turbulent economic and consumer backdrop.  \n We have continually adapted to the environment around us, delivering ease, value and inspiration to our guests, all at a time when daily doses of joy are needed more than ever. And amidst this volatility, we continue to hone the foundational elements that it takes to be a long-term winner in retail.  \n Fourth quarter comparable sales grew 0.7% on top of nearly 9% last year. And for the full year, comparable sales grew 2.2% on top of nearly 13% in 2021. While our business has been generating growth on top of growth for years now, the mix of last year's sales looked vastly different than what we had expected. \n Throughout 2022, changing attitude towards COVID, followed by the pressure from persistent inflation, caused demand for discretionary categories to slow meaningfully. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to this year's inventory commitments in many of these categories. And we're focusing on the agility of our operating model to adjust should sales trends exceed our expectations.  \n In light of the volatility we've experienced, I often get the question, what did Target learn from the past year? What I'll share with you today are some of the lessons learned. In short, we've learned that our strategy is working. At the same time, we've come to further appreciate the importance of strong day-to-day execution, combined with the agility required to react even quicker to changing consumer trends. And of course, last year, reinforced the importance of providing every guest with a great shopping experience. \n Most of what I'll share today likely won't sound all that different from the playbook we've used for the past few years. That is intentional. For example, our multicategory assortment continues to resonate with our guests, even as consumer demand continuously evolves. The unique balance we've achieved across all five of our core merchandising categories continues to be a key differentiator in the market, with each category serving at times as a trip driver, at other times as a basket builder, and oftentimes as both.  \n Throughout 2022, we saw and continue to see incredible growth in our Food & Beverage and Essentials & Beauty businesses, offsetting a meaningful pullback in discretionary categories like Home, Apparel and Hardlines. But despite this pullback, these discretionary categories still delivered around $55 billion in sales last year.  \n In both our Food & Beverage and Beauty categories, 2022 delivered the third consecutive year of double-digit sales growth, stemming from increases in both traffic and average ticket. And while we're thrilled to have driven unit share gains across all of our major categories last year, we saw the strongest gains in these rapidly growing frequency categories, a proof point of the relevance and value found in these assortments.  \n In Beauty, we continue to be a market leader, delivering the highest growth rates of any category we sell. We've been seeing outsized growth across the entire portfolio from everyday beauty assortments to new and exciting offerings like those we've added through our partnership with Ulta Beauty. In fact, last year's sales from Ulta Beauty at Target were more than 4x higher than in 2021, and this growth was almost entirely incremental. As such, we remain excited to continue opening additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations this year and beyond.  \n Of course, we don't build an assortment for a given snapshot in time. Rather, we flex across our categories as consumer demand shifts. And even in tough times, our discretionary assortment provides a unique opportunity to connect with guests in key moments, from major life changes, to seasonal celebrations and everyday moments in between.\n Now I want to be clear that despite our cautious inventory position in discretionary categories, we're still focused on delivering newness throughout the portfolio and placing select bets in businesses where we believe market share opportunities are strongest. That's because despite continued volatility the path that Target guests are attracted to all things trendy and new. We believe our commitment to newness is a key reason why we continue to generate traffic growth, and why we drove broad unit share gains last year. \n Our focus on balance can be found within each category as well, where we continue to offer both industry-leading national brands and high-quality affordable owned brands that are unmatched by our competitors. Our owned brands have long been a source of pride and differentiation for Target, offering great style and quality, all at incredible value. So it's no surprise that our owned brands have continued to outpace total enterprise growth and why we have plans to launch new or extend assortments in more than 10 owned brands this year.  \n Recently, a study listing the 10 fastest-growing private label brands in 2022 included three found exclusively at Target. Target was the only retailer to have more than one brand on the list, and two of them were the only nonfood brands to make the cut.  \n Many retailers were not focused on newness in 2022, but the opposite was true at Target, where we continue to excite our guests with innovative and trendy products. For example, we launched Future Collective, a first-of-its-kind apparel owned brand, featuring collections in partnership with a rotating roster of diverse influencers. This innovative approach blending the strength of Target's owned brands with the excitement of our limited-time partnerships and collaborations has been a huge success, particularly with Black guests, furthering our commitment to ensure all guests see themselves reflected in our assortments.  \n Most recently, we launched a new line with actor and influencer, Tabitha Brown. Tabitha's energy and passion absolutely shines in this new line, and our guests are loving it. Tabitha serves as the latest example of the endless possibilities that comes from bringing together the incredible talents of diverse designers and the power of Target's multi-category portfolio.  \n Take a look and see what I mean.\n [Presentation] The passion of these designers is so inspiring, the emotion and pride is palpable, and we love the way the Tar-zhay magic of these partnerships cut across categories, including last quarter's launch of Marks & Spencer and Tabitha's recent extension into food. \n And while these collaborations offer joy for our guests, recent history has reinforced that focusing on the basics of retail is just as important as the latest innovation or new offering. In fact, nailing the fundamentals is the bedrock of a successful retailer, from the overall shopping experience to ease and convenience, relevance, everyday value and more. \n Of these fundamentals, we know that a strong and reliable shopping experience is the surest way to build trust and affinity. So we aim to provide a consistent, joyous and easy experience, both in stores and online, making Target a shopping destination, not just a means to an end. To do this, we've invested heavily in new stores, our remodel program and our same-day fulfillment services, as John will highlight shortly. We led the way in comprehensive pay and benefits, attracting and retaining the best team in retail, allowing us to provide a level of service unmatched by our competitors.  \n We've invested in one-of-a-kind brand partnership experiences like those with Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. And while some of these partnerships are newer, we featured Starbucks in our stores for decades, proof that when we work with iconic brands, we build lasting relationships. With a Starbucks in nearly all of our stores, they have become part of the shopping ritual for many of our guests. In fact, we've served up more than 170 million Starbucks beverages last year alone.\n A strong digital shopping experience is every bit as important as the one we create in our stores. So we've been investing to ensure that the experience is seamless across every channel, regardless of how our guests shop. Whether searching for an item or browsing for inspiration, we continue to elevate their experience, providing personalized and relevant content using our incredible data and guest insights. This will include more customized homepages, improved search functionality and even more personalized offers from Target Circle. It will also include more relevant content from our digital advertising business, Roundel. Our digital success won't be driven by a single service or offering, but through a comprehensive set of experiences designed to be greater than the sum of the parts. \n Target Circle is one of the nation's leading loyalty programs with over 100 million members and growing. Through continuous learning and application of guest insights, Target Circle served up 3x more personalized offers in 2022 and Target Circle members spend 3x more on average this past holiday season.  \n We also continue to invest in the tools, team and capabilities of Roundel. To us, Roundel is more than a digital advertising platform or another revenue source in the P&L. The goal is for our guests to have a tailored, relevant experience, while helping our vendors reach the guests who are most likely to be interested in their products. Said simply, Roundel makes us better merchants, more consistently serving our guests with the products they want. This is why our approach to digital advertising looks different than others. We put our guests at the center of this strategy, just as we do in every other aspect of our business. It's no wonder we continue to see such explosive digital growth, why Roundel grew by more than 60% over the past 2 years, and why we'll continue to leverage the risk -- rich guest insights.\n And regardless of whether our guests are shopping online or in-store, they are looking for comprehensive value now more than ever. That means offering great everyday prices and promotions and offering quality and inspiration. After all, Target invented affordable joy decades ago and is still a key differentiator in a crowded retail market.  \n Our guests see value in countless ways, from our competitively priced and high-quality owned brand offerings to multiple RedCard benefits, including 5% off on every trip and free shipping for all online orders, all with no annual fee. We offer compelling value at every turn, and we are continuously listening to our guests to understand what value means to them. \n And beyond these retail basics, we continue to hear from our guests that they prefer shopping with companies who prioritize people and planet. That's why we're so focused on our Target Forward strategy. This isn't a standalone strategy, but rather Target Forward is fully integrated throughout our business, fueling our growth potential, while bettering the world.\n As part of this strategy, we'll continue to elevate Black voices and brands and are on track to spend $2 billion on Black-owned businesses by 2025. We'll also continue to focus on designing products for a circular future like in our owned brand, Universal Thread, where we are using materials such as recycled cotton and polyester. These are just a few of the countless examples of how we push ourselves and industry partners to grow sustainably.  \n Our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life requires a balance of quality, value and innovation that sets us apart from competitors. We are relentless in ensuring every decision supports this delicate balance. It's easy to say, but takes incredible diligence to execute. And while you've heard me say it before, it bears repeating now. We truly have the best team in retail. I'm so grateful for the many efforts of our team to serve our guests and each other, day in and day out.  \n With that, I'll turn things over to John. Yes, happy to. First of all, over the last couple of years, we've gained a tremendous amount of new guests into the Target ecosystem. And so our focus right now has been to deepen our engagement with the guests. Of course, we always want more guests, but the opportunity in front of us is much more to convert them into using the suite of capabilities because they become much more loyal. They understand the Target value proposition more deeply once they experience the ease and convenience of Drive-Up or once they recognized what an incredible food and beverage offering we have. And so that's our primary focus right now. \n When we talk about trade down, those are words that are used in many different facets. Sometimes it's used internally in talking about private label. For us, we talk about owned brands rather than private label because these are brands we've invested in for years. We build them, design them, create the packaging, the marketing materials, and they're hugely important to our strategy. \n And so in that sense, we never think about it as trade down. We think about it as trade in. It creates more options for people to use and engage with our portfolio because it tends to be the same great quality at incredible price points. And so the growth of our owned brand strategy would reflect significant potential in the future based on the success we've had in the past. \n So right now, our focus is to make sure our guests are aware of what we have and create a better, less frictionless experience, make sure that we deepen the loyalty with the consumer. Yes. So first, Roundel, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is an incredibly important part of our ecosystem. It gives our vendors an opportunity to target the guests that they see as most likely to be intrigued by their new products and the quality of merchandise that they're bringing to market. It allows us to highlight those products and give them real-time insights about how it's selling because of the closed loop reporting that we can offer. \n And so this has been a huge part of the demand generation for a lot of our businesses. We are very engaged with a broad spectrum of vendors across the entirety of the portfolio, and believe that Roundel is going to be an important part of the future, partly because of that guest-centricity that we bring to the model, but also because our guests want to know what's new and relevant, both across owned brands and national brands and how it fits into their lives. \n So maybe I can pivot to that second question and really talk about what opportunities we have. Well, we have a broad portfolio. And we think the strength of our multi-category portfolio is a differentiator in the market. We don't build an assortment for a snapshot in time. So having a healthy business across every dimension, allows us to flex as market conditions change. \n Right now, we're flexing into Essentials & Beauty and Food & Beverage. But a couple of years ago, it was Home and Hardlines that took the center stage. So having the ability to connect with consumers and having relevance and strong market share positions in many businesses is important to us. The way that we continue to build relevance is by staying super guest-centric, working to make sure that we are a destination for seasonal businesses. Seasonal businesses are kind of in our core DNA because it's a great way for guests to do more in one store at one time. Everything you need for back-to-school. You can get your backpack. You can get your calculator. You can get your pens and paper. You can get your new outfit. \n So those are really important to us, but the other is the importance of newness. And you heard me talk a lot about that. They're in an environment where consumers are making trade-offs. More of the same is not going to get it done. And so really investing in innovation and something that excites them, like our Apparel floor pad right now, if you haven't been in our stores or on our site lately, go check it out. The colors, the styles, the aesthetics are right on and it's absolutely grabbing the attention of our guests. Yes. First and foremost, Beauty at Target has been a success story for a number of years. We have an incredible assortment that's been relevant for a while. But adding Ulta Beauty has completed our assortment. Our ability to offer prestige products in our store with a servicing experience and expertise that Ulta has brought to the table has been the missing link. And so we've completed that picture. \n And so really excited about the performance, really excited about our partnership and we're looking to accelerate. We're already at 350 stores, and we'll add more, as John talked about, as part of our remodel program. So really bullish about the future there. Yes. The most consistent theme is where there's innovation, there's still relevance. And so consumers are finding them. Social media, of course, is a great way for consumers to become connected to new products and new ideas, and you'll be surprised things will spike quickly. \n And sometimes we don't see them coming. In other times, we're well prepared. But I would tell you that there are pockets of those in every business. And so right now, we're planning the discretionary categories at an aggregate level more cautiously, but we're certainly leaning into market share opportunities where we see them. We believe that there's opportunity in the Home business, and we'll be launching more brands in the back half of this year, both on the national and owned brand side that have the potential to grow share in that category. \n We're seeing it definitely in Apparel, where you get the right fashion moment and the right fashion trend. It doesn't matter that they bought a lot of performance wear over the last couple of years, they're still interested in buying new. And so that's been the most consistent correlation. \n With that said, we're also introducing that level of newness and interest in categories like Food & Beverage and Essentials. Our favorite day brand that we've launched over the last couple of years, was a -- which is a sweets brand, has been -- has seen explosive growth over the last year or 2. And this is a place where we've taken the liberty to innovate in basic categories, whether it's cookies or ice cream and so forth, and the flavor profiles, the way that they brought the items to market have really shown that the guests will engage across the board if we give them a reason to."

            "name": "Michael O'Neil",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Brian. Really happy to be here and excited about the opportunity to lead this work for Target. I've been at Target now for 15-plus years, started in finance, worked in various roles with our merchandising operation partners to help deliver on their strategic priorities and their financial growth. Through that experience, I got to see the business model through the lens of the P&L. \n A couple of years ago, I went over then to human resources and led our pay and benefits and strategic workforce planning teams. And that was a great opportunity to see the business through the lens of our team members. I had a chance to lead that team during the early days of the pandemic and saw quickly the work our team does to take -- the importance of taking care of them to take care of our guests.  \n From there, I've been back now in finance for a couple of years, and was leading the financial planning and analysis teams where we work with every business function to deliver on both our finance and strategic priorities. And coming back to finance and seeing the growth we've seen over the last couple of years, it was pretty apparent to me the opportunity to step back and think about how do we run this business model now at the larger scale. And so I think with those experiences, plus the relationships I've built over these 15 years, I think, position me well to lead this work forward. Yes. I think I'll start maybe with what it isn't. This isn't about sacrificing long-term growth for short-term profits. A typical tactic here is to look to shrink your cost base in the face of declining revenues. Well, that's not Target, right? We are growing, continue to grow. In fact, this work has come out from the growth we've seen over the last 3 years. We've grown $30 billion -- over $30 billion since 2019. That's more than 14 years prior. And that creates a tremendous opportunity to step back and reimagine how do we operate this business at a larger scale, but more importantly, how do we position Target for future growth.\n And so as we're looking for efficiencies, we'll look for ways to simplify the work, to streamline processes, to reduce redundancy, all with the mind of how do we make it easier for our team members to deliver a great guest experience. In doing so, our initial scoping says, we'll deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of cost savings over the next 3 years. Sure. I've got a couple of those questions as well. And I would say, I reiterate that this is not about the work over -- or what's happened to us over the last 12 months. It's about the growth that we've seen over the last 3 years. And so no, what's not included is anything that will come, the natural recovery from the headwinds of last year. This work is the designed to deliver fuel beyond that, both to deliver on our -- both our top line and our bottom line goals. Yes, I think that's a really important question. And the things we're not willing to sacrifice start with a team member and the guest experience. We're not going to take away anything given the investments we've made in our team over the last couple of years, and spending that time in human resources during those early days of the pandemic had an appreciation for all our team did to run our business and to serve our guests. And so I look at our team members and the investments we make as an investment in the best team in retail. \n Similarly, on the guest side, our shopping experience is a key differentiator for Target, and we're not looking at anything to take away from that. In fact, our guiding principle around this work is, how do you make it easier for our team members to run our business and in doing so, deliver a great guest experience? And so we do that, we think we'll see benefits to both the team and our guests. Sure. I think it's -- you're going to see it across the full P&L. So I'm not sure you're going to be isolating it to one single component. What excites me about this work, though, as we think about running the different scale, I think there's top line opportunity. And so it's going to start with sales. Now we're not going to do anything against the -- we're going to continue to invest in our team, but any efficiency work will have SG&A impact on the SG&A line. And product costs continue to be our biggest line item on the P&L, so we'll see it there as well. But I also will say it'll expand beyond the P&L as we look to be more efficient in our CapEx. Sure. We touched base on a lot this morning that work around digital fulfillment, I think, is a great example. We've been -- that work in several years underway, when you think about our stores as hub model, has significantly decreased our fulfillment cost. John mentioned 40% over 3 years.  \n We've also been able to increase speed of delivery and improved the guest experience across all those different nodes, whether that's ship-to-home, Drive-Up, Order Pick up or Shipt delivery, and it's extremely capital efficient.\n If you look forward now, we think there's hundreds of million dollars to continue to unlock with our investment in sortation centers. That's a business -- that's a capability that's been on our road map for a few years now, but requires scale and density at the market level to unlock. And given the growth over the last 3 years, we now have that.\n And so we think there's opportunity in a dozen of metro markets. We already have 9 facilities out there and plan to have a total of 15 by 2026. And so we'll open those up, but also we'll make those centers more efficient as well as we think about streamlining processes in them and looking to introduce automation and technology. Yes. I think the best example is the work that's underway now in Apparel. This one is near and dear to my heart. My first role at Target was the finance partner for our women's apparel business. I also think it serves as a really great example of what is possible with this work. Apparel, just like the rest of our business, has seen explosive growth. We've grown over $3 billion and now a over $17 billion business in Apparel business. It also has its unique complexities, right, from the fact that we partner with vendors to source raw materials, to the fact that we have unique fixtures in store for presentation. So all the geographical and weather and demographic considerations that go into assortment planning and allocation. \n And so that growth, combined with that complexity, makes a tremendous opportunity to step back and say, how do we run this business at a larger scale and how do we position it for future growth? And so we're focused right now on driving simplicity, speed and consistency across the entire pair of value chain. And in doing so, we expect to see benefits from assortment planning, to supply chain, all the way down to guest fulfillment.  \n And the benefits will be across the P&L. We'll see it in lower markdowns, we'll see it in increased productivity -- labor productivity, and we'll see it in top line sales. And so I love that example because it gives you a chance to step back and say, look, we've seen this growth over the last 3 years. How do we look end-to-end across the value chain to position it differently? How do we simplify for the work for our guests? And in doing so, we believe we'll see benefits across the P&L with the most important one being top line sales. Well, I'd say thanks for letting me come up to share just a couple of examples. I would say -- I'd reiterate is this starts with growth. It starts about how do we make it simple and easier for our team members to deliver a great experience. And that work is going to be a multiyear journey, and this will require end-to-end problem solving across the value chain. But when we do that, we focus on making a better team member experience. We'll see a better impact to our team, our guests and our P&L. Thanks, Brian."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Well, good morning, and thank you for joining us. Looking forward to spending this time with you. We're eager to share our plans, including how we'll continue to grow, how we'll continue to rebuild profitability on that growth and how we'll strengthen our business in conditions that have changed a lot since we gathered here at the Time Center last year.  \n At that time, we just passed a crucial milestone. We had just become a $106 billion company. For the full year 2022, which we're reporting today, we placed another $3.1 billion of revenue growth on top of that growth. We grew traffic by 2.1%. We gained unit share across our core merchandising categories, which means that consumers were constrained by inflation and have to be very selective about where they shop and what they buy, continue shopping and buying at Target. And despite difficulties throughout the year, we closed the books on 2022 with our 23rd straight quarter of comp sales growth. However, the path between last year's Time Center meeting and this one was anything but predictable. \n When we last gathered here, New York was still under a mask mandate. And though -- although consumers had started moving towards postpandemic behaviors, with families returning to travel and restaurants and shifting some dollars at a retail, we are just beginning to see how volatile and uncertain 2022 would become as spiraling inflation forced families to put discretionary purchases on hold and focus most of their spending on necessities. And there was a rapid escalation to the most expensive operating environment we've seen in decades, all of which was made worse by the spike in fuel prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine. Those variables and many others continue to have a profound effect on the retail landscape.  \n So this morning, we want to take stock of that situation. We want to speak clearly of how Target is planning to stay on our growth path for the years ahead. We're keeping this morning's agenda very focused on our strategy, operations, growth investments and financial expectations. We see this as a time to combine steady leadership with our long-term strategy and a continued focus on agility and strong focus on retail fundamentals. Our goals this morning are to show you how we're navigating near-term challenges. How the durability of our business model lies in its flexibility. We'll share what we're prioritizing to stay in step with our guests, and how we'll flex across our multi-category portfolio, which means, in the near term, leaning into growth in nondiscretionary categories.  \n We'll also reinforce how the trust and loyalty we've built with our guests shows in our traffic and share gains. Given value is absolutely top of mind right now, being able to deliver affordable joy, differentiates us in the marketplace. And that's a clear advantage in the near term and remains our focus over the long term. With those factors in mind, we also want to use this time to set clear and realistic expectations so shareholders and stakeholders can track what progress looks like in 2023. \n Taking a step back, I might start by recognizing that our growth in '22 didn't come easily. It wasn't nearly as profitable as we expect it to be over time. In 2020 and 2021, our team put in the effort and the hustle to keep pace with the most turbulent business environment many of us have ever seen. They brought the expertise and excellence to take the company to a new level. But while we gained incredible scale by continuing to prioritize our guests, I acknowledge we're still developing some of the tools to marshal that scale efficiently. \n Yet, as we think about what growth looks like from here, it's helpful to anchor back to what we were saying at year-end 2019. At that time, we were putting up proof points on a strategy that was and still is unique in retail, when we built to reliably deliver low single-digit increases in sales year after year. It started by investing in our team, in part because we believe human interaction is the key to growth in a digital age. As we move into 2023, we'll continue to support our team and lean into our culture, knowing they're at the heart of our overall success. \n The 2019 strategy put stores at the center of everything. Because when we remodeled or added a store and improve the guest experience, comps grew. At the same time, turning stores into fulfillment hubs was and still is the most efficient and least costly way to grow omnichannel sales. As you'll hear today, we're not standing still on our store remodel and expansion plans or investments in a bigger supply chain or ongoing improvements in digital. It's no surprise that 100% of our store sales are fulfilled by stores. But in our case, more than 95% of all sales, including digital, are, too.\n Since 2019, our store base has only grown slightly, but total sales grew nearly 40% in that time frame. Our digital business nearly tripled in size, and our sales per square foot increased by 37%. And fulfilling substantially all that growth through essentially the same asset base was nothing short of incredible on the part of our team. So as we hold on to those gains and look to put growth on top of them, we'll continue to invest in stores, in supply chain, in digital through our stores as hubs model. \n Our 2019 strategy prioritize the differentiation and profit performance of an owned brand portfolio that is simply unmatched in retail. At the same time, we're curating national brands our guests love. And in 2019, we had just started our premier partnerships with Levi's and Disney. Since then, both those partnerships have expanded, as of partnerships, with Apple and Starbucks. And as you know, we're in the middle of building on an incredibly exciting partnership with Ulta Beauty.  \n Meanwhile, our team has built on our position of strength in owned brands, adding 17 of them since 2019. That includes 2 more $1 billion-plus brands in Good & Gather and All In Motion. But we're not slowing down with owned brands. In fact, just the opposite. As you'll hear from Christina, we're planning a steady cadence of newness in owned brands and national brands across our multi-category portfolio in the year ahead.\n What else was in the 2019 strategy? Well, that was a year we introduced Target Circle. At that time, it was a powerful new asset for guest engagement, personalization, loyalty and sales that quickly attracted 50 million users. Since 2019, the user base has doubled and is still growing meaningfully. And Circle has become the heart of our increasingly connected loyalty ecosystem.  \n Since 2019, our media company, Roundel, has grown significantly with great additional growth and profit potential on the horizon. It's sought after by advertisers for its relevance and reach, and it's growing each year because our guests appreciate the engagement and the value it delivers. Roundel makes for a more deeply engaged guests and partners. And because it gives us better understanding of our guest preferences, it makes us an even better and more profitable retailer. So we intend to place additional emphasis and investment towards Circle and Roundel in 2023, given the growth potential they'll unlock.  \n So let's pause here, and I'll start to put all this together. While I'm deliberately drawing a connection between 2019 and the year ahead, there's one giant difference, we're starting 2023 on a revenue base of $109 billion, not the $78 billion we had back then. There are other big differences, too. Today, we're reporting a full year comp increase in the low single digits, similar to 2019, and unit share gains across all 5 of our core merchandising categories. But unlike 2019, our 3-year revenue growth is $30-plus billion, not just $8 billion. And our digital penetration now stands at nearly 19%.  \n During the pandemic, guests became more attached to Target. And as we deepened engagement with guests, more moved into the ranks of our most engaged, measured by spend, trips and cross-category purchases. Guest engagement is also reflected in a significant increase in transactions since 2019. In fact, those increases started as far back as 2017. And we're positioned to keep growing engagement levels across our guest base even as we focus on expanding that base overall.  \n So standing here today, my sense is that if a new normal is on the horizon, it will be much more like 2019 than the last 3 years. And as we plan prudently to invest in 2023, we see a return over time to solid and consistent growth with operating income margin rate that should move towards and then begin to move beyond our prepandemic rate of 6% in the next few years.  \n Today, we'll show you our work for how we arrived at that conclusion. But a spoiler alert, it starts with the strategy. You've seen it many times before, and while the facets on this slide haven't changed, we're prioritizing to accelerate key growth drivers and making changes that will help us respond to the short-term environment, while continuing to advance all elements of our strategy. They all work together to keep our growth trajectory rolling.\n Christina will cover that in greater detail, including the focus this year were placing on the magic of Tar-zhay, on affordable joy and on digital growth, Target Circle, Roundel and our enterprise sustainability strategy, Target Forward. Then John will cover what we're learning from an ongoing operational evolution, what we're testing, what we're in the process of optimizing, what benefits we see from the standpoint of efficiency as we continue to scale. Michael will describe how we're planning cautiously, and we believe appropriately, given the economic challenges we anticipate this year. \n But caution doesn't mean cut off from continued growth and progress. In fact, some of the most exciting progress we anticipate will be translating our newfound scale into simpler, more efficient ways to run Target. The difference between an enterprise-wide efficiency mindset and a cost-cutting program starts with what questions you ask yourself. For us, the question isn't, what can we cut? It's how do we make things easier for our team to more efficiently deliver a guest experience, that continues to live up to our brand promise. So we'll invite Mike O'Neil, the leader we tapped to coordinate these efforts across Target, to offer his perspective on efficiency, what it is, what it isn't, how we can drive continuous improvement and what we can unlock with this focus.  \n We're looking forward to the next hour or so. We recognize that the landscape is unpredictable, and there are plenty of near-term challenges on the horizon. We believe 2023 will be a year in which the durability of our model allows us to flex up the categories and the value proposition that are most relevant to our guests today. We'll double down on execution, so our guests get all they've been promised every time they turn to Target. And we'll stay focused on gaining share across our portfolio, underpinning all the work we're doing around efficiency, to provide fuel for longer-term growth. We're optimistic about what this team can deliver and realistic about how 2023 will keep challenging us to be agile, resilient and responsive for our guests, our communities, for each other and for our shareholders.  \n Before we leave here today, our goal is to take you along. So you can see exactly what we're seeing. And with that, let's get going. Well, Michael, thank you, and Mike, thanks for joining us today. I know everyone would like to get into the work, but I think it would be really helpful to just pause for a second and talk about your background and why we selected you to lead this very important initiative. Mike, when we asked you to lead this project, we spent a lot of time thinking about the guardrails. Now obviously, there's big opportunities that we want to capture. But there's also things we never want to compromise. Do you want to talk about the opportunities versus the guardrail of let's say, \"We'll never head in this direction?\" So Mike, I know you're still in the early stages of scoping the work, but there's also things that we've been working on for quite some time now that we can build on. Do you want to highlight some of those? So Mike, I love the way you framed this up. This is all about fueling future growth, driving simplicity, reducing complexity, never compromising the guest experience and the role our teams play. Are there any other components as you think about this, that you want to touch upon? Well, Mike, I want to thank you for joining us on stage here today. We're really excited about the opportunities that are in front of us. You've heard a few examples today, and we'll continue to provide updates along the way. \n So Mike, thank you for joining us. Michael, I'll have you back here in a second. So as we get ready to hear from you and take your questions, I thought I'd briefly recap some of the themes you've heard today. First, our commitment to our guests is as strong as ever. Second, our strategy, our multi-category portfolio, our stores as hub model will provide the flexibility we need to keep growing because we're going to stay closely connected to our guests. Finally, there have been some fundamental changes at Target over the last 3 years. We're more than $30 billion bigger. We set the omnichannel standard with stores as hubs. We'll continue to build and innovate in that realm. We'll set the pace in supporting and developing the very best team in retail. \n Perhaps the most important takeaway is something that hasn't changed, and that's our ability to shift our business and our categories in step with our guests. If they need to prioritize food and essentials, we'll lean into those categories. But as you heard from Christina, in a year when discretionary spending was down, our discretionary categories generated $55 billion in sales. Our guests today are responding to newness. They're celebrating seasons as we just saw with Valentine's Day. They're eager to be out in our stores and enjoying that guest experience, and we're seeing it in our traffic growth. And we know they really value affordable joy. \n So we remain fully committed to our multi-category portfolio, to essentials and to our discretionary categories. And as our guests lean back in discretionary categories over time, we'll be ready to flex into those trends, building substantially on the near-term plans we share today. \n We know that will happen. But in the meantime, we're moving forward thoughtfully. We're doubling down on retail fundamentals. We're finding fuel for further growth through efficiency. And while we're emphasizing prudence in our near-term performance, I am incredibly positive about the long-term potential and our ability to translate both into positive outcomes for all stakeholders, including shareholder returns over time. \n So I want to close by thanking our team as they tune in from around the globe, and thanking all of you for staying with us on this journey. \n And with that, I'll ask Christina, John and Michael to come back, and we'll open it up for your questions. All right. I see hands already going up. We've got paddle runners around the room. As I call on you, I might ask you just to pause, introduce yourself and ask your question. So why don't we start right here. Michael? Michael, why don't I ask you to start, and then I'll come back and answer the back half of that question. And Michael, back to lessons learned from last year. We've used the term uncertainty quite a bit today. We recognized last year that the consumer trends move very quickly. And one of the things I'm most proud of is the way this leadership team embraced the challenge, took it head on, made the adjustments in our inventory and protected the guest experience. That's why we continue to see traffic growth and unit share gains across our portfolio and why we're so well positioned today for 2023 with overall inventory down 3%, but importantly, discretionary inventory down 13%. \n So lessons learned for us, but I'm incredibly proud of the way this team dealt with that issue upfront, protected our team, protected our guests and position us for the long term. \n Why don't we go over on this side. All right. So several questions to answer there. John, I might ask you to start and explain why we're so excited about the changes we're making with returns through Drive-Up. And then Michael, we can talk about the second part of the question. Yes. John, I think one of the things we've learned over the last 3 years, and we watched it carefully as we expanded Drive-Up and Pick Up and started delivering right to your home with Shipt, we said, all right, is this going to impact the guest engagement in store? It's quite the opposite. As guests use all of our capabilities, they actually spend more dollars in-store and just reward us with more trips. So it's been an important learning that we'll build on. And I think we'll just deepen that engagement as we give them another easy solution for returns. I think I see a hand up right in this first row. In fact, quite a few. We'll start right in the middle. Yes, I'm happy to start. It's a piece of both. We've seen some structural changes in the business. We talked about shrink as being one, and that's not one that we expect to turn in a different direction quickly. But the efficiency we've been able to drive, given how efficient stores are as a fulfillment hub is a huge advantage to us when it comes to digital fulfillment. It's fast for the guest, the economics of it work for us and we build engagement like we talked about before.\n Separately, we continue to be focused, as Mike shared, on the efficiency work. And that's important work. We want fuel from efficiency, to keep investing in growth of the business. And that will also play a role in getting us to the right profit outcome that we should have as a $100-plus billion retailer. \n Go ahead, Mike. Why don't we go in the back? Okay. Christina, do you want to talk about what we're seeing as far as guest shopping behavior? Right. Moving right here. You got the mic. The power of the mic, Greg. Michael, why don't I start with the focus on traffic. And as we sit here today, and you've heard me talk about this for years and years now, we think one of the most important indicator of a retailer's health is the traffic indicator. And that's why we feel so good about the fact that we've had 23 consecutive quarters where we've seen comp store sales growth, and it's all on the back of traffic. We're getting more footsteps into our stores, more visits to our site, greater engagement. Our guests are spending more with us. They are rewarding us with more trips and they're shopping more categories. And we think that's critically important. \n To John's point, while we've seen a significant lift over the last few years in our sales per square foot, we know there's still potential to go further. And as we think about capabilities like Target Circle, our ability to connect with those guests and deepen their relationship, introduce them to newness in our assortment in other categories, we think we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us.\n But sitting here today, I continue to believe looking at trips is critically important. And in an inflationary environment that we're working in today, it's why we're so laser-focused on unit share improvement because those things are going to be really important as we move to a more normalized environment, because the guest is turning to us more frequently for all of their needs, both frequency and discretionary. They're shopping more categories. So making sure we're looking at units carefully, looking at trips to me is a key indicator of the health of our business today and why we're so excited about the potential in front of us. Okay. Why don't we go back there. Right. Well, Christina, I'll let you talk a bit about Roundel and just how important it's been for our vendor partners and deepening engagement. But the second question is something we talk about all the time. And sitting here today, you and I both know, while we have built great momentum and added over $30 billion of growth, we know we still have category opportunities all around us. Yes. I want to go back to the heart of your question. Do we have opportunities to continue to grow share? And it's something that Michael and I talked to many of you about all the time. Despite the growth we've seen over the last few years, adding well over $30 billion of top line growth, sitting here today, we represent 3% of the retail market. So as a leadership team, we see opportunities to grow across our entire multi-category portfolio, continue to leverage growth in store and from a digital standpoint. \n So while we've seen tremendous progress and we're proud of the way we've transformed the business, we still see a significant runway to take share across every one of our major categories going forward, leveraging that great in-store guest experience and the digital experience we offer, that great combination of inspiration and ease that makes Target such a great destination for guests across the country. So we see tremendous opportunities for years to come to continue to bolster our share position.\n Let's come back to the front row. I know your hands have been up for a while. Christina, you want to start and talk about Beauty? And then Michael, we can talk about '23. Yes. Ed, you and I actually walked a store recently. And I think you heard from our local team, the fact that very excited about the results we're seeing with Ulta Beauty and it's clearly driving even more traffic to Target. But at the same time, that team talked to you about the fact that our core beauty assortment continues to grow. So they're complementing each other, and we're just becoming more and more destination for that beauty shopper. Great. Let's go to this paddle right here. Christina, you want to unpack some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories? Chris, if we go back to discretionary categories. You heard us talk today, Christina highlighted the fact that in 2022, despite some of the softening trends, we still generated $55 billion of revenue in discretionary categories. One of the things I highlighted this morning during my CNBC interview is I go back to 2019. We've grown our discretionary portfolio by almost $14 billion. \n So we're going to move forward from a much bigger base and much more relevance in those categories. And to Christina's point, we know they are going to return to growth over time It's going to be led by newness and innovation in the near term. But we're in a much different position going forward than we were prepandemic. And I think we have much more relevance and credibility in the space than ever before. I'm trying to scan through the room to see hands that have been up for a while that we haven't gotten to. Let's come back over here. All right. Looks like we've got time for one more question. I see a paddle up in the back. Right. So with that, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I know we'll see many of you throughout the year, and I hope to see all of you back here at the Time Center next year. So thanks for joining us. Get home safe."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. As Brian mentioned, it was exactly a year ago that we were on this stage, talking about our 2021 financial results, a year in which our business generated double-digit growth in comparable sales and even faster growth in EPS. And as Christina discussed, we knew on that day that the environment was likely to change, but we didn't yet know how dramatic those changes would be. The rapid pace of this transition led to multiple profit pressures on our business, including markdowns and other costs related to last year's inventory actions, significantly higher shipping and domestic transportation costs and higher inventory shrink.  \n So as we focus on our business plans, both for 2023 and the longer term, it's important to consider how the environment will continue to evolve. On the one hand, many things about life and consumer behavior already look a lot like they did before the pandemic. Students are back in school, sports arenas are full, people are eating out again and consumers are embracing in-store shopping.  \n At the other extreme, certain aspects of life appear to have changed forever. Many office jobs are now hybrid, with remote work and virtual meetings playing a much more significant role. That means many of us are spending a lot more time working at home, which has implications for long-term buying patterns in multiple categories, most notably our Food business.  \n Fulfillment mix has also seen a permanent shift. Our same-day services have seen explosive growth. They now account for more than half of our digital sales and more than 10% of our total sales. And that trend shows no signs of reversing. Even as people have remixed their trips in favor of in-store shopping, guest engagement with these digital services has continued to grow on top of the huge expansion that's occurred over the last few years.  \n Most importantly, our guests' overall engagement with Target has increased significantly over the last few years, and it continues to grow. Think about it this way. In 2021, guests made about 2 billion trips to Target, which was about 300 million higher than in 2019. And last year, even as consumer spending moved away from products into services, traffic grew again. The deeper relationship we've established with our guests and our proven ability to deepen it further are some of the many reasons we're so well positioned to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.  \n Beyond the factors that have changed permanently, there are several others that are clearly still in transition. These include transportation and the global supply chain, where we've already seen remarkable improvement, but we're still facing elevated costs and variability compared to the prepandemic period. Another factor is inventory shrink, which has increased broadly across U.S. retail over the past 2 years. And finally, the most significant and important driver of uncertainty today is the fact that the broad macro economy is still in transition, leading to an inflationary period, more pronounced than we've seen in decades.  \n As Christina mentioned, rapidly rising prices have put pressure on discretionary spending as consumers make room for higher prices on necessities. In addition, higher interest rates have further pressured budgets by increasing the cost of mortgages and car loans.  \n So where does that leave us today? Despite all of the recent turmoil and the pressures facing our business, we remain in a very strong position to drive healthy growth in the coming years. Our guests are more engaged than ever, and that engagement continued to grow even during a tumultuous year. And even after a year in which we experienced unique and unexpected headwinds to both our profitability and cash flow, our business is sound, it remains strong and we're laser-focused on the path forward.  \n In 2023, we'll focus first on agility and strong execution. Most notably, we'll take a cautious stance on our inventory commitments and markdown-sensitive categories, with the flexibility to sell into our base inventory and expand receipts over time. At the same time, we'll continue investing in our long-term strategic initiatives that propel our market share and profit growth, including our remodel program, our new store pipeline and projects to add replenishment capacity and increased efficiency in our supply chain. \n We'll also focus on strengthening our balance sheet. In 2022, our business was a net user of cash for the first time in many years. This was driven by a host of unique factors, including unexpectedly low profitability, higher-than-expected CapEx driven by inflation and project costs and a rapid slowdown in inventory turns due to excess inventory and longer lead times in global shipping. \n This year, we expect each of those factors to become more favorable. More specifically, we're expecting an increase in profit dollars and a somewhat slower pace of CapEx. And given our cautious inventory positioning and rapidly improving lead times in global shipping, we're planning for faster inventory turns in 2023, driving higher payables leverage and recovery in working capital as we move through the year.  \n In the near term, until those expectations play out and our cash generation increases, we're not planning to repurchase any shares, consistent with our goal to maintain our middle A credit ratings. Over time, as our cash flow recovers and our debt metrics improve, we expect share repurchases will play a meaningful role within our broader, long-term capital deployment priorities. But as always, those repurchases will only occur after we fully invested in our business and supported our team, after we've supported our dividend goals and within the limits of our middle A ratings.  \n Now I want to share some thoughts on our 2023 outlook, and I'll start with our expectations for the first quarter. Given the current conditions we're facing, we expect our business to generate first quarter comparable sales in a wide range, from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase. This reflects our expectation for continued strength in our frequency businesses, offset by softness in discretionary categories.  \n On the operating income line, we're expecting a first quarter rate in the 4% to 5% range, higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter, but down somewhat from the 5.3% our business generated in last year's first quarter. While there are a number of factors driving this expectation, I'd note that our first quarter SG&A expense rate is expected to be about 1 percentage point higher than a year ago, reflecting continued investments in our team and guest experience, without an expected leverage benefit from higher sales. Altogether, on the bottom line, we expect our business to generate first quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS in a range from $1.50 to $1.90.  \n Now I'll turn to our full year expectations, and I'll first note that the range of potential outcomes gets wider as the year goes on, given the high degree of uncertainty regarding the strength of the economy and the consumer. Given this uncertainty, we firmly believe caution is the appropriate posture, especially when planning sales and inventory in discretionary categories.  \n On the frequency side of the business, our full year plans envision continued share gains and strong sales growth. But we're mindful that inflation in these categories may begin to moderate, pressuring dollar comps across the industry. In light of those considerations, along with our outlook for discretionary categories, we're planning for the same wide range on the top line that we're planning for the first quarter, from a low single-digit decline to a low single-digit increase in our comparable sales.  \n In terms of profitability, the range of potential outcomes is similarly wide. As I mentioned earlier, we're positioned to benefit from a number of significant tailwinds on the gross margin line, most notably as we cycle over last year's inventory actions. In addition, we're expecting hundreds of millions of dollars of additional opportunity from lapping last year's unusually high freight and transportation costs.  \n At the same time, we're also preparing for some notable headwinds on the gross margin line. These include inventory shrink, which may continue to rise before we see rates begin to moderate over time. We're also expecting some pressure from soft sales in our highest-margin discretionary categories. And finally, we see the potential for increased promotional intensity across the industry this year, given that we're competing in a constrained environment for consumer spending.  \n On the SG&A line this year, we expect continued strong discipline in managing costs across the enterprise, but we're also not backing away from investments in our team and guest experience, and we'll face potential rate deleverage given our outlook for comparable sales.\n In light of these considerations, we're planning for a wide range of potential outcomes for our full year operating income. But even at the low end of those expectations, we expect to grow our operating income by more than $1 billion this year. Altogether, our expectations translate to a full year GAAP and adjusted EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75, which represents growth of about $1.75 per share at the low end of the range.  \n On the CapEx line this year, we're expecting to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion. While this range is somewhat lower than last year's CapEx, it's quite strong relative to our history. This year's plan reflects the optimal level to invest in the current environment and our expectation that we'll continue to earn high returns on our long-term growth investments, including our remodel program and new store pipeline and our continued work to build capacity and capabilities in our supply chain.  \n As we think about the longer-term trajectory of our business, we expect that as external conditions normalize in the next several years, our operating income margin rate should reach and begin to move beyond our prepandemic rate of 6%. This return to prepandemic levels could happen as early as 2024, depending on the speed of recovery for the economy and consumer demand.  \n I want to pause and emphasize that this year's guidance does not reflect how we expect our business to perform over the longer term. Once we see a normalization of consumer demand and a resumption of growth in discretionary categories, you'll see that reflected in a stronger top line performance and a meaningful increase in our operating margin rate beyond what we're planning for this year.  \n I also want to reiterate something we've said many times. While we often talk about rates because it's helpful for analytical purposes, our goal is to find the optimal rate that maximizes profit dollar growth over time. In other words, we'll continue to focus simultaneously on top line growth and the rate we earn on it without focusing on either metric and isolation.  \n So now before I invite Brian and Mike O'Neil to join me on stage, I want to pause and thank our team for their continued optimism and resilience through a turbulent year. Last year presented a host of unexpected and unprecedented challenges that all seemed to arrive at once. Through it all, our team maintained a long-term focus, serving our guests and taking care of each other.  \n As a result, we saw continued expansion in guest traffic and engagement throughout the year and historically strong hiring and retention metrics across our team. Those are some of the most important factors in determining our long-term success and why I feel so confident about Target's potential in the years ahead.  \n Now I'd like to invite Brian and Mike O'Neil to join me on stage so we can have a brief conversation about the enterprise efficiency work we've asked Mike to lead. Mike, when you took on this role, we spent a lot of time talking about what this work's about and what it isn't. Can you share a bit about the reasons we've initiated the work and what we're looking to accomplish? Mike, I want to clarify one thing briefly. After Brian and I mentioned this effort in our last earnings call, we got some questions about whether that $2 billion to $3 billion number includes the natural recovery from the headwinds we experienced in 2022. Can you help clarify that? Mike, since we first announced this work, I've had a bunch of investors ask me where they should expect to see the results of this work show up in the P&L? Can you share your initial thoughts? Thanks, Mike. Can you also provide an example of a newer effort you're excited about? Great. Yes. So we've got a journey in front of us on the profit front, and 2023 plays an important role in stepping back to where we expect to get over time. When we guided to a wide range today, even at the low end, we expect over $1 billion in net income growth year-over-year. And we want to execute that plan, that's first and foremost. Under the right set of conditions, we think we can get to 6% in 2024. And then we'll take it from there. But we've got the next couple of years squarely in focus because we've got work to do to recover our performance from last year.\n As we think about what's optimal over time, I'll go back to what I said in remarks, we want the optimal rate that maximizes profit dollar growth over time. And I think there's still a few variables that will click into place between now and when we have that conversation in the quarters and months to come. But we want to be focused on dollars, in dollar growth, philosophically, that's the thing that we'd leave the group with today. Yes. Just -- at risk of piling on. We care about economics at the transaction level. We care about the economics at the category level. We care about the economics at the fulfillment path. But the thing that we thought differently about over time is cutting the economics by guests. When we take friction out of the process and make it easier for guests to just fall more and more in love with Target, that's the most powerful economic relationship to be focused on. I think we've learned that time and time again, and Drive-Up is a perfect example. \n On the free cash flow question, we're not guiding to free cash flow specifically, but we expect material improvement from a free cash flow basis. And I touched on some of the drivers. The first is better profitability. The second is we expect working capital recovery. I mean our turns slowed, our supply chain times were longer this year and that came with working capital investments to make sure we're getting product here early enough with a volatile supply chain. And so we were running at suboptimal working capital levels through the bulk of 2022. As we move through 2023, I would expect that to improve. Sorry, Brian. I'd add on as it relates to capacity, particularly because you brought up fulfillment, we've seen our sales productivity in the store increase by 37% over the last 3 years, Brian mentioned that. We still have -- so an average store has gone, call it from $40 million to $55 million over the last 3 years. We still have stores that do over $100 million and do well over $100 million. The top quartile does significantly more than the median store.\n So we have tons of capacity sitting out there unused in our stores and the ability to turn faster, again, back to we need to improve how we move inventory and how quickly we move inventory, which we're on the journey on, but our stores have significant capacity to continue to drive both in-store sales and our digital business. On the $2 billion to $3 billion, there's a piece of that, that shows up in 2023. But a large chunk of that is multiyear in nature. And you think about the apparel example that Mike shared, I think that's just a perfect example. That's a business that grew so fast over the last few years and our teams did an amazing job to protect the good guest experience as we grew. \n But when we step back and look end-to-end across a business like apparel, we just see how much opportunity to simplify. Make things easier for the guests. Make things easier for our team. And changing some of those core processes won't happen overnight. That's why the multiyear nature is important. But we expect those benefits to be significant. Yes. It's a good question, Karen. And I guess I'd go back to just kind of philosophically how we think about the business. We're in the maximizing dollars business. And so we'd read and react through this year to make the right choices that we think maximize profit dollars both for 2023 and position us well for beyond. \n I'd love nothing more than in the quarters to come and to say, gosh, some trends played out stronger. The consumer was stronger in the back half of the year than maybe we thought. And if that's the case, then we'd happily have that conversation and be thrilled to outperform. \n But I think the reality is, as we sit at the start of the year, it's an uncertain environment. And we want to plan cautiously in that. And that isn't just kind of on paper caution, that's making sure that we're positioning the business right. It was important to start the year clean from an inventory perspective. We feel like we've accomplished that goal. And we'd like to lean appropriately cautiously in our inventory buys in the discretionary categories with a ton of flexibility to react if things would turn out better, but we think that's prudent for the volatility that we see right now. Yes. Maybe I'll do those in reverse. The wide range of guidance that we gave today is reflective of the scenarios that we envision right now. And so we feel good about the line we've drawn in the sand with that guidance now and we'll get a lot smarter together as the year plays out. \n When it comes to margin opportunities, we've talked about a lot of them already, but maybe one I would add to the list, just as a for example, is to link some of what Christina talked about with Target Circle and how valuable it is for us to be able to interact with our guests in a more individualized way. And that translates to good news on the top line, and we can make the right offer or the right message show up for the right guest at the right time. \n It should also translate to efficiency on our markdowns as we get more efficient with personalized promotions. We've learned over time that a personalized promotion has a higher return than a mass promotion. And so Circle gives us the opportunity to do even more of that better in the years to come. \n And so there's a lot of macro puts and takes, no doubt, as we unpack margin in the years to come, but there's also some important things that we're driving within the business that you know."

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. So Brian talked about the last few years being unpredictable. To put a finer point on that, if you had told me in late 2020, during the height of the pandemic, that 2022 would be the most challenging operating environment in my career, well, I would have assumed you were joking. Yet shifting consumer preferences, supply chain volatility and rising inflation created a set of conditions that called for flexibility, responsiveness and resilience. Our environment remains volatile, and we expect 2023 will have its own unique set of challenges. But if I've learned anything over the past 3 years, it's never underestimate the power of a purpose-driven team and the culture they create.  \n 2022 offered more examples of Target teamwork than I can count, but two will stick with me for quite a while. 5 months ago when Hurricane Ian devastated communities across Florida, our team sprang into action. They didn't wait for me or Brian or anyone else on the leadership team to tell them what to do. Instead, they gathered input from those on the ground and told us what they needed. Pop-up resource centers that provided laundry, food, gas, restroom, showers and Wi-Fi-enabled laptops to 700 team members and their families. Extra inventory to stock local stores with essentials guests would need to weather the storm, and financial support, $5 million to fund local relief efforts and up to $3 million in matching donations to our team member giving fund, which provides assistance to team members affected by natural disasters.  \n It was about the same time that our inventory action plan was in full swing. You'll remember, we announced bold measures last summer to quickly take action to rightsize our inventory in response to shifting consumer demands. It was a big ask of our team, one that required them to move quickly and aggressively to reduce existing inventory and cut back on receipts for the back half of 2022. And the team responded as they always do with heart and hustle. They worked through 8 distribution centers worth of inventory in a matter of months, putting us in a strong position heading into the critical holiday season. That's our culture in action, bottom-up ingenuity centered on caring for our team and our guests. And it's that culture that fuels our strategy and growth.  \n For years now, we've shared our vision of using our stores as fulfillment hubs to get closer to our guests. It was an idea that was novel when we first introduced it, but it's been widely adopted as others expand their view of what stores can do. Now I'm an engineer to my core. So it gives me great satisfaction to see the way Target built our stores as hub strategy from the ground up and how our operating model gets stronger with each passing year. \n We don't have a rigid road map. Instead, we use a highly repeatable process to test concepts, refine them, test them again, until we can replicate them with confidence, efficiency and scale. And then and only then do we ask ourselves what's next? And how can we make this even better? And the whole process begins again.  \n Let's take Drive-Up. You can trace the origins of Drive-Up to the launch of our Store Pickup service a decade ago. It took a few years to get Store Pickup where we wanted and when we did, we were able to take it one step further with Drive-Up. We launched Drive-Up as a test in our Minneapolis market in 2017. By the following year, the service was available in more than 1,000 stores around the country, and it reached all 50 states in 2019.  \n With the foundation in place and operating at scale, we started to explore new capabilities. In 2020, we made fresh and frozen groceries available. In 2021, we added adult beverage and expanded our app to give guests a more customized experience. Last year, we began testing Starbucks at Drive-Up. And today, we're announcing the next phase of our Drive-Up services with Drive-Up Returns, which started as a pilot last year and will be available across the chain by the end of the summer.  \n Not only is this a huge win for our guests who can now do even more at Drive-Up, but it brings more efficiency to our returns process, with more resale opportunities and fewer expenses for mail-in returns. We're combining the strength of our digital self-service returns process with our industry-leading Drive-Up experience to meet our guests where they are.  \n This is what it means to be a truly omnichannel retailer, giving our guests the flexibility, ease and convenience to shop the way that works best for them and scaling capabilities across every facet of our business. Online, in-store, Drive-Up, it doesn't matter how they choose to shop with us. We're here to make their Target run better than ever.  \n Looking back, the evolution of Drive-Up may seem like it was a natural progression, easy to predict and implement. When you're bringing to market new ideas in an environment that is anything but stable, you have to be ready to adjust course and explore alternatives. Our team has gotten really good at moving in step with the needs of our guests. That flexibility and a commitment to the fundamentals that make or break a retailer, things like hiring the right people, offering the right products and delivering the right experiences to our guests, underpin our stores as hub strategy and contribute to our larger story of growth.  \n Same-day services like Drive-Up are a great example. They grew nearly 7% last year as more shoppers appreciate the convenience and speed with which they can check off everything on their list. And because we own our same-day capabilities, pickup and Drive-Up are much more economical and flexible than other forms of digital fulfillment. In fact, our average fulfillment cost per unit has come down 40% over the past 4 years as our same-day services have grown to account for over half of our digital sales.\n Again, these results don't happen overnight, and they aren't achieved in a vacuum. They are the product of steady investment and listening to our guests. Take our stores, which sit at the heart of our stores as hub strategy and play a dual role of shopping destination and fulfillment hub. Our stores are not only beautiful, with open floor design, plenty of natural light and design elements that reflect the communities they serve, they're built to keep inventory moving through our system and support Target's trajectory of growth.  \n Late last year, we introduced a new store prototype in Katy, Texas. From the front entrance to the back room, this 150,000 square foot store is a stunner. Beautiful design elements reflect the local environment and community. Features like natural refrigerants, electric vehicle charging stations and rooftop solar empower our Target Forward sustainability ambitions and get us closer to our goal of net zero emissions by 2040. And a backroom 5x bigger than our average store allows us to ramp up same-day fulfillment, while preserving a seamless experience for our guests and our team.  \n We plan to open about 20 stores this year in a mix of sizes, from the shores of the outer banks in North Carolina, to the heart of Inglewood, California. We're also planning to invest in about 175 stores throughout the year, ranging from full remodels to the addition of shop-in-shop experiences like Ulta Beauty and retrofitted fulfillment spaces to support our same-day services. Our ongoing investment in our suite of stores is just one way we're building for the future.  \n What might be less evident to our guests is how we're building facilities behind the scenes to make their experience even better. We've built upstream capacity by opening flow centers in Chicago and New Jersey, with several more slated to open over the next few years. And a new food distribution center that opened in Maryland this past October expand support for our growing food and beverage business. This additional capacity gives us more flexibility to manage inventory and keep our stores stocked with the items guests want when they want them.  \n We're also making investments downstream. Earlier this month, we announced the expansion of our sortation center network to more than 15 facilities by the end of 2026. These facilities have transformed how we move inventory with speed and precision to guests' doorsteps. We started with a prototype less than 2 years ago to see how we might bring more efficiency to how we sort, batch and route packages. Today, we have 9 sortation centers open across the country, allowing us to deliver packages to guests within 2 days. Up to 40% are delivered 1 day when using our last-mile delivery capabilities with Shipt. And because Shipt is fully integrated into our last-mile operations, we benefit from significantly lower delivery costs.  \n To give you a closer look at how these sortation centers have become core to our business, we ask leaders from Target and Shipt to give you a brief tour and talk about how our test and learn approach applies to last-mile delivery. Let's take a look. \n [Presentation] As you heard from [ Dory ], [ Saad ] and [ Kamau ], we've learned a lot over the past few years, using every opportunity to improve speed, cost and quality. And in regards, our sortation centers are just hitting their stride. We delivered more than 25 million packages through sortation centers last year, and we expect to double that amount in 2023 with the help of our local and national carriers.  \n Together, the investments we're making create a more nimble sourcing, inventory management and fulfillment capability at Target, and they continue to help us navigate tough times, prepare for the unpredictable and fuel steady growth, all thanks to our incredible team. We've made huge strides in recent years to connect with our guests through our stores. The momentum continues to build, and I look forward to sharing progress with you and our guests in the quarters to come.  \n Michael, I'll turn it over to you. Yes. The majority of returns come back to store, but a meaningful portion are still shipped back to us. So that's not insignificant. As it relates to your -- the second part of your question around attach rate, and this is the question when we started Order Pick Up and when we started Drive-Up. And to us, that's respectfully not an important consideration.\n What is important is allow the guests to interact with us how they choose. And at every step when they see us -- when we see them jump into Drive-Up, when we see them use Shipt, when they -- we see them use Pick Up, their engagement with Target increases, not just digitally, but also in-store, and that becomes a better guest for Target. The best guest set for Target are the ones that interact with all of our various ways of interacting with them.\n And so this provides them another opportunity to create ease. You've got your kid in the back. I need some milk and I got to return this, whatever, at Target. I put that in my trunk. I show up. They bring the milk, they take that away and I'm off on my day again. And then on Saturday, we'll come in and do the stock-up trip and that will be great. So our approach is just to continue to lean into where they want us to go. \n Top two feedback things on Drive-Up, why can't I get my coffee? Why can't I get a Starbucks? And why can't I return something? And so we're still working on the Starbucks, but we're ready for returns. And again, if we listen to the guests, they'll engage with us. And maybe for the second part of your question, Greg, when it comes to margin and profitability in general, it starts with what Brian did. The strength of the top line is going to matter a lot and we feel encouraged by the traffic trends that we've seen. \n In terms of the other structural buckets, you hit on a few of them. We talked about shrink. We've seen a normalization in some of the credit metrics we watch, I think consistent with what you'd see in the industry. I wouldn't put that highest on the list of factors for next year, but it's one we'll stay close to and monitor. \n We've also talked and some of what we covered earlier today, we expect a promotional environment next year. We see guests responding to promotion in the fourth quarter, and we expect that, that's something that could continue. We'll also have some tailwinds on the margin side though. I mean we're anniversary-ing a level of markdowns in salvage that was extremely typical for us, and we want to make sure we recover that. We've seen some improvement in supply chain and freight. And so as we anniversary some of the peaks from last year, that should be a good guy on the margin line. And so it's all of those variables that we factored into the guidance we gave today. Yes. I think we're both at, what, 20 years or so at Target, Christina? We've seen ebbs and flows across the categories in our assortment over that time. And to us, the long-term winners will be the ones that build engagement in the moment now. That's why we're so focused on traffic. Apparel and Home will have their time in the sun again, and we'll be well positioned when they do. \n On the first quarter versus the balance of the year, I think I'd go back to just some of the broader themes. I think the biggest variable, that's a tough one for any of us to predict right now, it's just what's the path of the consumer during the year. We planned the first quarter reflective and mindful of the discretionary trends that we saw in the fourth quarter. And we'll learn a lot, I think, together as we move through the year, and that will inform what the balance of the year plays out at. But we think an appropriately cautious approach based on the trends we've seen is the right place to start and we'll unpack it as the year progresses."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Target Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 16, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our third quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the third quarter and his perspective on the upcoming holiday season. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John. As I begin the call today, I want to highlight the proactive leadership position we will continue to take as the operating environment changes. Just as we took decisive action in the second quarter to rightsize our inventory, we're moving proactively in a period of rapidly softening demand and elevated uncertainty to successfully navigate near-term challenges alongside our team and in step with our guests. \n As we look specifically at third quarter results, they demonstrate how our business continues to serve our guests even in the face of an increasingly challenging backdrop. Because of the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests over the last several years, our top line continues to benefit from growth in guest traffic and unit share gains across all of our core categories. This is particularly notable as consumers are showing increasing signs of stress and pulling back from discretionary purchases, and it reinforces the value of having a balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to satisfy our guests' ever-changing needs. \n In today's environment, that means we continue to benefit from strong growth and market share gains in the categories our guests are leaning into most right now, including Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials. Q3 comparable sales grew 2.7% on top of 12.7% a year ago and 20.7% in the third quarter of 2020. \n As you recall, early in the second quarter, we announced we would be taking decisive inventory actions based on the rapid change in consumer buying patterns that emerged near the end of the first quarter. These actions were designed to ensure we could continue to provide what our guests know and love about Target. More specifically, the effort was designed to free up space in our stores and hours for our team to continue offering fresh inventory and a reliable, uncluttered shopping experience for our guests, setting up our business to deliver strong growth in Q3. \n Among the drivers of our comparable sales, third quarter traffic expanded 1.4% on top of 12.9% growth a year ago. In addition to traffic growth, we saw a 1.3% increase in average ticket as guests continue to rely on Target for convenient, reliable one-stop shop. Across our merchandise categories and similar to the second quarter, we saw a very strong growth in our frequency businesses, led by double-digit growth in both Beauty and Food & Beverage. That strength offset persistent softness in our discretionary categories, which worsened at the end of the quarter. Christina will provide more detail in a few minutes. \n While overall Q3 comp growth was nearly identical to our second quarter performance, we experienced dramatically different trends within the quarter. More specifically, through the first 2 months of the quarter, we had seen comp growth of well over 3%, and then saw a deceleration to just under 1% in October. \n Even within the month of October results in the back half of the month were much softer than in the first half and the mix of our sales tilted much more heavily towards promotions. This rapid change in trend is consistent with what we're seeing in syndicated data on broader industry trends and the feedback we're hearing from our guests. More specifically, consumers are feeling increasing levels of stress, driven by persistently high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and an elevated sense of uncertainty about their economic prospects. \n With high rates of inflation contouring the road, their purchasing power, many consumers this year have relied on borrowing or dipping into their savings to manage their weekly budgets. But for many consumers, those options are starting to run out. As a result, our guests are exhibiting increasing price sensitivity, becoming more focused on and responsive to promotions and more hesitant to purchase at full price. \n On the profit line, we saw an expected improvement in the third quarter as we move beyond the bulk of those costs from our second quarter inventory actions. However, Q3 profitability came in well below our expectations, driven by several factors. First and foremost, we faced an unexpected gross margin rate headwind from a higher-than-expected mix of promotional sales as guests moved away from full price purchases. \n In addition, like the rest of the industry, we're facing a growing financial headwind from shortage, which is running hundreds of millions of dollars higher than a year ago. Along with other retailers, we've seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business. As a result, we're making significant investments in training and technology that can deter that and keep our guests and store team members safe. \n Looking ahead and taking recent trends into account, our team is making adjustments in real time with agility and flexibility in light of the revised expectations for both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. It's in tough environments like these that we're most fortunate to have a durable business model and a strong balance sheet, allowing us to maintain our focus on long-term investments and market share opportunities at a time when many others will be forced to pull back. And to create additional capacity for us to continue investing in long-term growth and market share while also delivering strong bottom line performance, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to identify opportunities to simplify and enhance the efficiencies of our business. \n I want to make it clear. This effort is not about slashing resources. Instead, it's about optimizing our operations to match the scale of our business. This effort is particularly important today because of the rapid and unanticipated level of scale our business is added since 2019 as total revenues have grown from less than $80 billion in 2019 to a projection of well over $100 billion this year. \n While our team has done an excellent job of staying agile and quickly accommodating all that growth. We now have an opportunity to look from top to bottom across all of our operations to ensure they are fully optimized for the size of our business. We're still in the process of fully scoping out this effort, but we believe it presents an opportunity to save a total of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next 3 years in support of our investments in long-term growth, along with our profit goals. \n In the near term, our team is energized and laser-focused on bringing the best of Target to our guests throughout the holiday season, knowing it's critically important for Target to be there for them during the busiest time of the year. Our team is committed to offering value across our entire assortment through great everyday prices, unbeatable value on our owned brands and accessible opening price points in every category. \n In addition, we'll highlight our compelling and simple promotions, free services like Drive-Up and in-store pickup and new accessible payment options. And of course, we'll provide additional savings opportunities through our RedCard and Target Circle programs, neither of which has a membership fee. \n So as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank the entire Target team for your energy, your spirit, your care for each other and your passion for our guests and our brand. You're the reason that Target has such a positive impact on the communities where we live and work and the reason we're known as a welcoming and inclusive brand. \n Thank you, and happy holidays to all of you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The current retail environment requires tremendous levels of flexibility, resilience, stamina and focus, a balance our team continues to carry out at every guest interaction. Consumers are strained as they work to support their families' day-to-day needs while looking for the occasional affordable luxury, prepping for the changing seasons and planning for the holidays. \n It's a difficult balance to strike in getting increasingly difficult each week as more and more of their household budget goes towards the needs of the family, which limits the amount available for discretionary purchases. So it follows that of the many considerations that our guests are currently juggling, we consistently hear that value remains at the top of the list. We see our guests holding out for and expecting promotions more than ever, spending less on regularly priced items. \n When they shop our frequency categories, some guests are trading into smaller pack sizes, opening price point options or owned brands to reduce their spending on a single trip. Others are opting for larger pack sizes or stocking up when items are on promotion, knowing they will receive greater per unit value. And these trends only became more pronounced towards the end of the third quarter when spending patterns change dramatically. \n With inflationary food prices absorbing more of their spending, those costs are crowding out other categories, including spending on discretionary items, and in some cases, even household essentials. However, we also know both from our recent performance and from guest surveys that despite the pressures they're facing, our guests want to celebrate the holidays in person with loved ones, and they're looking for Target to provide them safety, ease and joy as they prepare for every celebration. \n These themes played out in the third quarter as guests responded increasingly to promotions, even as they celebrated key seasonal moments like back-to-school, college and Halloween. Among our frequency categories, Beauty continues to drive strong performance, delivering sales growth in the mid-teens. Skin care, hair care and cosmetics, all performed very well and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings nearly tripled their total sales volume when compared to this period a year ago. \n Food & Beverage continues to outperform the market with low double-digit growth and strength across the portfolio, gaining both dollar and unit share every week throughout the quarter. Comparable sales in Essentials categories grew in the low single digits, reflecting particular strength in pets and health. \n While already soft, sales trends in our discretionary categories softened even more in the last few weeks of the quarter, a trend that's persisted into the first few weeks of November. But importantly, despite this challenging environment, we still saw unit share gains in all 5 of our core merchandising categories in the quarter, a sign that when guests are looking for convenience and value on both wants and needs, they're increasingly turning to Target. \n Apparel comps were down only slightly in Q3, driven by growth in kids, men's, seasonal and new fashion forward assortments, offset by softness in swim, women's accessories and basics. In Home, sales declined in the mid-single digits despite strong performance in seasonal areas. Hardlines sales were also down mid-single digits reflecting continued softness in home electronics and sporting goods. Additionally, we saw a meaningful deceleration in toys this quarter, most notably in October. This is a trend we will continue to monitor closely as we move throughout the holiday season. \n Across the portfolio, owned brands continue to outperform their national brand counterparts, growing at double the rate of the total enterprise in the third quarter. Because of our unique industry-leading, in-house design and sourcing capabilities, Target's exclusive owned brands provide tremendous quality at incredibly competitive prices, a great combination anytime but never more so than in an inflationary environment. \n So as we turn our focus to Q4, we'll do what we always do, work tirelessly to deliver value and solutions to our guests while also delivering affordable joy at a time when they need it most. As we've outlined this morning, we're taking a prudent approach to our inventory planning and sales expectations for the fourth quarter in light of the concerning industry trends we've seen over the past several weeks. But even with this cautious stance, we're focused on providing our guests with affordability and ease at every interaction with the Target brand. \n One of the signature ways we plan to stand out this holiday season is through our focus on the combination of newness and value, which cut across all our core categories. Given that the gift-giving season is underway and our guests are turning to Target more and more for their Food & Beverage needs, it's an ideal time for our recently announced partnership with British retailer, Marks & Spencer, who has collaborated with us to offer a limited time assortment of gourmet, premium food and chocolates, that's sure to be a perfect gifting solution this holiday season. \n Despite recent trends in toys, we know they will play a critical role for our guests over the holiday season, and we have all the top toys and exclusives this year at incredible prices. Back by popular demand, our exclusive assortment from FAO Schwartz features more than 120 toys. And for all the Marvel fans out there, the first of its kind collaboration between Target and Disney will feature exclusive Black Panther merchandise and experiences, including the only-at-Target, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever War on the Water LEGO set. \n And the power of these partnerships doesn't stop there. We've added nearly 50 Disney shop-in-shop experiences this year, bringing the total to well over 200 of these shops across the country. In partnership with Apple, we've more than tripled the number of shop-in-shops since last year, and our Target Circle members have access to free trials of some incredible Apple services, including a free 4-month trial of Apple Fitness+. And with Ulta Beauty at Target, we'll have opened another 250 locations this year and now have more than 350 locations open across the chain. \n Through all our new tried-and-true and exclusive holiday offerings, we'll remain laser-focused on supporting our value proposition with key deals starting earlier than ever. Week-long Black Friday deals and our guest-favorite Deal of the Day offers are available now and feature our best plan prices for the season, with prices up to 50% off across toys and games, electronics, kitchen appliances and more. Besides industry-leading promotions, we are offering compelling, easy to shop, everyday price points on key items like $3 Christmas ornaments, $5 holiday Wondershop and candle assortments, and $10 gifting assortments across categories like Beauty, Apparel and Home. \n And to reinforce our commitment to value, we'll be offering free and easy payment and fulfillment options, including our recently launched reloadable RedCard, which provides all the benefits of our RedCard debit and credit programs, including free shipping and 5% off every purchase, all without the need for a credit check or an existing bank account. Combine this with our easy, convenient and free same-day service options like Drive-Up and order pickup, all with no membership fees and our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle, we have an unmatched combination of value-added and affordable shopping experiences to help our guests celebrate and amplify the joy of the holidays.  \n Throughout the season, we will remain nimble and respond to changes in consumer promotional and macro trends, always in service of optimizing current and long-term performance. And despite the challenges facing our business and our guests, we have a not-so-secret-weapon to help us provide joy and value for our guests, a world-class team. Like Brian, I want to pause and add my sincere gratitude for the Target team. No matter what is thrown your way, you execute with grace compassion and consistency, a combination that leads our guests to return to our stores and website time and time again. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. Across the operations team, we focus every day on delivering strong execution, even as we continue to keep our eyes on and invest in projects that will support Target's long-term profitable growth. As you know, throughout the year, our supply chain and transportation teams have been continuously navigating through an unpredictable environment, and these volatile conditions continued in the third quarter. The good news is that the lead times in global shipping has started to move in the right direction. More specifically, compared with the second quarter, lead times improved by about 15% in Q3, and we're more than 3 weeks shorter than a year ago. \n While we were really pleased to see this improvement, the acceleration was faster than we expected, causing many overseas orders to arrive earlier than needed. As a result, the team has been reducing lead times on our future orders just as they extended them during the pandemic. \n In addition, to prevent early arrivals from entering our distribution and store network before they are needed, the team has implemented multiple strategies and tactics, including new processes to efficiently segment shipping containers as they arrive at domestic ports, allowing early arriving containers to age before sending them downstream into our regional distribution centers. \n So today, even as we continue to look heavy on the balance sheet, our inventory is in a much healthier position than earlier in the year. Because the heaviness you're seeing today is due to the early arrival of fresh inventory, we are planning to sell. For example, by early November of this year, nearly 90% of our key Q4 programs had already moved into our distribution centers and stores. In contrast, last year, just over half our key programs were in the network as of the same time frame. \n Similar to our experience with lead times, we saw improvement across multiple dimensions of our transportation costs in the quarter, even as those costs remain above pre-pandemic levels. Container rates in global shipping have come down by about 1/3 in recent months, and we'll realize that benefit in 2023 as we renegotiate our staggered contracts with shipping partners. And importantly, we expect to see further reductions in those rates going forward as they remain about 3x higher than we were paying in 2019. \n Similarly, domestic transportation rates have come down since the beginning of the year, but remain higher than a year ago and double the rates we were facing in 2019. And of course, fuel costs, which are a major driver of our domestic transportation expense are still running more than double the amount we were paying in 2019 despite having moderated in recent months. \n Now I'll turn to the work of our properties team, where we're still wrapping up some projects but close to completing our supply chain and store projects for the year. On the distribution side, we're continuing our work to build replenishment capacity across the country, given the amount of growth we've delivered over the last few years. \n The other big addition to our distribution infrastructure is the build-out of our sortation center strategy. A year ago, we were operating a single sort center here in the Minneapolis market. And this year, we've opened 5 more with several more on track to open in 2023. These centers, which are typically a little bigger than a single store, increase our speed and meaningfully reduce our last-mile delivery costs in the markets where they operate. They also create backroom fulfillment capacity in the stores they serve, as they eliminate the need for each individual store to sort the boxes they've packed for delivery. \n On the store side, we are on track to complete about 200 full remodel projects this year in which we update every part of the store to reflect our latest thinking and offer a modern and inspirational shopping experience for our guests. Beyond full remodels, we're also on track to complete about 200 fulfillment retrofits this year in which we optimize their capacity and efficiency in supporting our same-day services. \n And finally, the team is on track to complete our new store program for 2022, in which we plan to add 23 new locations to the chain. The size of these new stores ranges widely from 19,000 to 145,000 square feet as we continue to open the right size store for the neighborhood we're serving. And as we've mentioned in recent calls, based on evolving conditions in the commercial real estate market, we've been finding more and more opportunities to open larger locations that can offer the full range of our assortment, along with a full suite of fulfillment options to serve our guests. \n In light of that opportunity, just over a week ago, we opened the first example of a new larger store prototype in the Houston, Texas market. At nearly 150,000 square feet, this new format incorporates our latest thinking in store design, featuring a more open layout, localized elements to inspire and serve our guests, 5x more space to support our digital fulfillment services and sustainable features in support of our Target-forward goals. While we'll continue to open new stores of all sizes in the next few years, we plan to lean into this new layout when appropriate and incorporate its features into other projects, including remodels. \n Among the many innovations we've incorporated into this new location in Houston, we've added 2 new Drive-Up services. The first is the ability for a guest to order a beverage from Starbucks on their way to pick up their Drive-Up order. We started testing this new service in the second quarter with a limited menu in a small number of stores, allowing us to collect feedback and fine-tune operations before expanding it more broadly. Based on the success of that pilot, earlier this month, we rolled it out to more than 200 additional stores across the country, just in time for the holidays. \n The other emerging capability is the ability for a guest to return a purchase through our Drive-Up service. We began testing this service only a month ago with our team members in a small number of stores, consistent with our test-and-iterate approach. Based on the operational success of that initial test, in early November, we expanded the service to our guests in that same small set of stores, and we'll look to apply any learnings from that guest-facing test before rolling out the service more broadly next year. \n So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams across the country who have worked tirelessly to ensure we are staffed and ready to serve our guests during the upcoming holiday season, our busiest time of the year. Consistent with prior years, before determining our seasonal hiring goals, we focused first on providing opportunities to our existing team to support their desired hours and backup training interests. \n And today, based on all that hard work in preparation, I'm happy to report that we're entering the holiday season in a very healthy staffing position, reflecting our success in hiring throughout the year, the significant wage investments we've made throughout the country, an increase in the number of team members who are looking to pick up extra hours and an 18% increase in applicants for seasonal positions compared with a year ago. \n As Brian mentioned, it's in times like these that we feel most fortunate to have a durable business model, which can sustain us through an ever more challenging economic and consumer backdrop and allow us to emerge with additional profitable growth and market share opportunities over time. That's why we're ensuring our teams are staying focused on our guests and taking the right actions to continue deepening our relationship with them. If we maintain that guest focus, I'm confident we'll find ourselves in an even stronger competitive position over time. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. I want to start where John just ended and reiterate how closely we're listening to our guests, ensuring we understand how they're feeling and how that is affecting their shopping behavior and moving quickly to serve their rapidly-changing needs. Obviously, if recent softening consumer trends continue through the fourth quarter, that will put some pressure on our near-term financial performance. But with a durable model and an agile team, we can navigate those challenges and emerge even stronger in the long term while continuing to deepen our relationship with guests and build long-term preference for Target. \n Once again, this quarter, I'm going to begin my remarks by covering our inventory position, given that it continues to be an important area of focus. And like last quarter, I'm going to base my discussion on comparisons to 2019, given the highly volatile conditions that have affected inventory since the onset of the pandemic. \n As you saw on our balance sheet this morning, we owned $17.1 billion of inventory at the end of the third quarter, which is $5.7 billion higher than the end of Q3 2019. In percentage terms, this year's number represents an approximate 50% increase from 3 years ago, a deceleration from 3-year growth of 68% as of the end of the second quarter. \n Of the dollar increase in our inventory since 2019, about 2/3 or $3.9 billion is aligned with our sales growth over that same 3-year period. The remaining 1/3 or about $1.8 billion is new inventory that's arrived early relative to when it would have been received in pre-pandemic years. \n This early inventory is being driven by 2 related factors. The first is our explicit decision to add cushion to our lead times this year in order to mitigate the risk we were facing a year ago when the bulk of our global shipments were arriving late. The second factor is the unexpectedly rapid acceleration in the global supply chain that we saw in Q3, which caused us to receive shipments even earlier than scheduled. \n It's also important to note that the composition of our inventory continues to evolve as we've leaned into frequency categories where we're seeing robust growth and taken an increasingly cautious position in discretionary categories. More specifically, the percent of our inventory units in discretionary categories was 8 percentage points lower than at the end of Q2 and lower than in 2019 as well. \n With that context, I'll turn to our third quarter financial performance, beginning with the top line. Total sales grew 3.3% in the third quarter, the same as in Q2, driven by a 2.7% increase in comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores. Total revenue grew 3.4% in Q3, reflecting a 9.5% increase in other revenue, which was driven by the growth in our Roundel ad business. Traffic continues to be an important driver of our growth, having expanded 1.4% in Q3 on top of nearly 13% growth a year ago. In addition, this quarter, we benefited from a 1.3% increase in average ticket. \n Among our sales channels, stores continue to drive our growth as we saw a 3.2% increase in store comparable sales in Q3 on top of nearly 10% growth a year ago. Comparable sales in our digital channel grew 0.3% in the quarter on top of nearly 30% last year. Same-day services led our digital growth, most notably through our Drive-Up service, which delivered high single-digit growth on top of more than 80% growth last year. \n As Brian mentioned, while our overall Q3 comp increase was consistent with Q2, we saw a dramatic change in the pace and composition of our business toward the end of the third quarter. More specifically, within the quarter, comparable sales grew 2.8% in August, rose to 4% in September and decelerated to 0.9% in October. Also notable, even within the October period, there was a dramatic change in the pace of our sales. \n As you'll recall, the month began with an initial round of holiday promotions from Target and some of our competitors, and in that week, we saw a high single-digit increase in comp sales compared with last year. However, for the remainder of the month, we saw a low single-digit decline in comp sales over those last 3 weeks. \n Nearly all of the slowdown was driven by our discretionary categories, Apparel, Home and Hardlines, as our guests became increasingly cautious in their spending in those categories at both Target and throughout the industry more broadly. So far in the month of November, trends have been largely consistent with what we were seeing at the end of October, in terms of our comp trends, the mix of sales between frequency and discretionary businesses and the focus on promotions by our guests. \n While our Q3 gross margin rate of 24.7% was more than 3 percentage points higher than in Q2, it came in far short of our expectations, driven by 3 factors. The primary driver was a higher-than-expected markdown impact from promotions as our guests became increasingly price-sensitive and concentrated their discretionary spending on items on promotion, most notably in the latter weeks of the quarter. While we anticipated a highly promotional environment this fall, given the excess inventory we had been seeing across retail, this enhanced focus on promotions reflects an increasing level of stress on consumers as they navigate through multiple headwinds, including persistent inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. \n A second factor that's impacting our gross margin is inventory shortage, or shrink, which is a growing problem facing all retailers. At Target year-to-date, incremental shortage has already reduced our gross margin by more than $400 million versus last year, and we expect it will reduce our gross margin by more than $600 million for the full year. \n As Brian mentioned, this is an industry-wide problem that is often driven by criminal networks, and we are collaborating with multiple stakeholders to find industry-wide solutions. For example, because stolen goods are often sold online, Target strongly supports the passage of legislation to increase accountability and prevent criminals from selling stolen goods through online marketplaces. \n A third factor that affected our Q3 gross margin was the incremental cost of managing early inventory. In the near term, these pressures should begin to recede as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year as receipt flow naturally moderates following the holiday season and we'll begin to benefit from the reduction in order lead times John mentioned earlier. \n And finally, regarding gross margin, category mix moved from being a slight headwind in Q2 to a small tailwind in Q3, contributing about 20 basis points of gross margin benefit in the quarter. This change in mix impact might seem counterintuitive given some of the category trends I highlighted earlier. However, underneath the surface of discretionary comps when compared to our second quarter results, comp sales in Apparel, a high-margin discretionary category got stronger in Q3, while comps in Hardlines, a lower-margin discretionary category saw a deceleration in the third quarter. \n Moving down to the SG&A expense line. We saw a small amount of deleverage in Q3, even as we continue to benefit from disciplined cost management across the organization. In spite of that discipline, we're facing inflationary cost pressures across multiple expense lines in the P&L. Within compensation, expenses reflect ongoing investments in hourly team member pay and benefits, partially offset by a year-over-year rate benefit from lower incentive compensation expense. \n Altogether, on the operating income line, on both a dollar and rate basis, we saw a year-over-year decline of about 50% in the third quarter. I want to emphasize that we're not happy with this performance and expect to deliver much stronger dollar and rate performance over time. \n Now I want to turn to capital deployment. And as always, I'll start by reiterating our priorities, which have been consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and build on our 50-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we devote any excess cash beyond these first 2 uses to repurchase our shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Beginning with our first priority, capital expenditures have come in at about $4.3 billion through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we're now expecting our full year CapEx will come in around $5.5 billion in light of continued inflationary pressures affecting the cost of this year's projects. We paid just under $500 million in dividends in the third quarter, up from $440 million a year ago, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in our average share count. \n And finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter, given current financial performance and the working capital investments we've made to support in-stocks and early receipts. In the near term, we will continue to take a very cautious approach to share repurchase in light of the volatility of the environment and our commitment to maintaining our middle A credit ratings. \n So now I want to close my Q3 review with a discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months of the third quarter of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 14.6% compared with 31.3% a year ago. While this is a disappointing decline, a mid-teens after-tax return on capital is still very healthy in absolute terms and a testament to the durability of our business. Importantly, we expect to see a significant recovery from this number over time as we move beyond the unusual headwinds that have been affecting our business this year. \n Now let me turn briefly to our expectations for the fourth quarter. In the current environment, we're facing an even higher degree of uncertainty than a quarter ago given the volatility we've been seeing recently. And in light of the dramatic changes in shopping patterns we've seen both at Target and across the industry, we believe it's prudent to plan for a wide range of comparable sales outcomes in the fourth quarter that's centered around a low single-digit comp decline, consistent with recent trends. \n Underlying the sales expectation, we're planning for softer discretionary category comps than we've seen in the last 2 quarters, partially offset by the benefit of continued strong growth in our frequency businesses. If these sales trends persist, we'd see far less of a benefit from leverage on fixed expenses than we've seen so far this year. \n In addition, we'd expect greater markdown pressure from Q4 promotions given the increase in price sensitivity our guests have shown recently and our commitments to end the year with a clean inventory position, especially in those categories where trends have softened. And as I mentioned, we're planning for additional pressure from inventory shrink, given the worsening trends that have emerged so far this year. \n Altogether, these expectations lead to a wide range for our expected Q4 operating margin rate centered around 3%. The single-most sensitive input to this profit projection is the level of demand for our discretionary businesses. If that demand improves from recent trends, we would expect fewer markdowns and would likely outperform our updated profit expectations; while if demand softened further, profit could see additional pressure. \n As we look beyond the holiday season, we're planning for a continued challenging environment as we move into next year. And as John and Brian already pointed out, we are fortunate to have a durable model that is well positioned to continue serving our guests even in the toughest of times. In addition, we have a significant opportunity to harness efficiencies in support of our long-term growth and profit goals. \n At the end of 2019, our operations had been built to support a business that delivered $77 billion in sales that year. And our long-term algorithm at the time was anticipating low single-digit top line growth in the years ahead. If things had played out that way, we might be looking at a total sales number in the low to mid-$80 billion range this year. Instead, even in the midst of a very challenging environment, we're positioned to deliver total sales of well over $100 million this year. \n So today, we have a compelling opportunity to look across our operations with an eye to simplifying and optimizing those operations for a more than $100 billion business. And today, as we look at the operations we have and where we think they can be, we believe there's a $2 billion to $3 billion savings opportunity over the next 3 years. \n To be clear, this isn't about slashing resources. And in particular, we're focused on continuing to invest in our team, which is our most valuable asset. As Brian said, we are in the initial stages of scoping this opportunity, and we expect to share detail on our progress at our 2023 Financial Community Meeting. In the meantime, I want to join Brian and wishing all of you a happy holiday season, and I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for making Target a great place to work and a store that's ready to bring joy to millions of our guests throughout this season and beyond. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Before we turn to your questions, I want to relay a few thoughts that I shared with our Target team earlier today. While the circumstances we're facing are difficult and certainly not what anyone would wish for, we need to embrace the moment, focus on what we can control and lean into our strengths. Because even as we face multiple challenges, all at the same time, we have an even longer list of strengths on our side. And there are quite a few headwinds, but we've shown time and time again that our strengths can overcome any challenge we face. \n We have nearly 2,000 well-located, well-maintained store locations. We have a rapidly growing set of owned brands that are already generating more than $30 billion in annual sales. And we have a unique and growing list of national brand partners, including Starbucks, CVS Health, Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. \n Our unmatched product design, development and sourcing capabilities allow us to offer an unbeatable combination of price, quality, design and fashion throughout our own brand portfolio. We have a durable operating model and a balanced portfolio of merchandise categories, which allow us to pivot quickly in a rapidly changing environment. \n Our operations are profitable, generate robust cash flow and are backed by a strong balance sheet that enables continued investment during lean times. And of course, we have a unique, amazing, passionate team that has only grown stronger over the last few years. So this morning, I've asked our team to focus on what they do best, moving with agility and responding to the environment in real time, delivering outstanding execution throughout the holiday season and beyond and doing it all as one team, aligned in support of our guests and each other. \n While we'd all prefer to be operating in a more robust environment, today, we have the opportunity and all the resources we need to continue playing offense while many others cannot. By harnessing the strength of our assets and our amazing team I'm confident we'll continue to grow guest engagement and deliver compelling growth on both the top and bottom line over time. \n With that, we can move to Q&A. Now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Can you talk about how you're -- so 2 questions. So my first question is, can you talk about how you're looking at your business from a planning perspective and how far the down-low single-digit quarter-to-date trend is relative to your internal plan? \n Said another way, we knew that holiday was pulled forward last year, given early sort of panic buying. As you think about the past month, is this 3-year trend also deteriorating? And do you think the perhaps the election exacerbated the trend? It seems like you're planning on a 1-year basis, on a 3-year basis, given comparisons into the balance of the quarter. \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure, Chris. This is Michael. I can take that one. We did see deceleration in the 3-year CAGR in the back part of October as well, and so we're factoring that into our extrapolated trends going forward. And you've heard me say, I think, other times on this call, Q4 is always its own animal, and so extrapolating trends into Q4 is tricky business in a normal year. But we think it's important to focus on the consumer changes that we saw in October and plan the business prudently and cautiously against those trends. It gives us the best position to be able to meet the consumer where we're at and continue to drive that unit share performance that we were pleased to see in the third quarter. \nBrian Cornell: Chris, did you have a second question? \nChristopher Horvers: Yes. The second question is really your views about structural margins and how it's changing. You did a 6% operating margin in '19, and you've just added $30 billion in sales. You did a $7 billion in '20 and $8 billion in '21. I guess, what's changing? How do you think about the puts and takes? There's more inflation, it seems like on the SG&A side. And yes, in the near term, there is more inventory moving costs and promotion. But I guess how do you think about the long term, especially in light of the $2 billion to $3 billion cost target? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, Chris, I'll take that one, too. We're definitely not operating at a profit level we expect to over time. And the onetime impacts we've seen this year from the volatility and the change in trend has led us to more markdowns salvage action on inventory than we've seen historically by a wide margin. And so we would expect to get a lot of that margin and that improved markdown performance back. And so that's the factor I'd start with first. \n And the second thing I'd call out is what you heard us describe in terms of the efficiency opportunities we have in the business. To your exact point, we've generated incredible scale quickly. That opens up a lot of opportunities for us to rethink process technology and create efficiencies throughout the business by taking that scale that came on us quickly, stepping back and optimizing the business against that scale. So we're excited about the efficiencies that should come with the growth that we've seen over time. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Obviously, Target performance this year has been volatile. And Michael Fiddelke, you just mentioned that you do believe you can get the margin that you lost this year to transition your inventory back. But now you're also saying that you need to cut $2 billion to $3 billion in cost to support your profitability over the next few years, which, in a way, undermines the idea that you can get the margin back that you lost. \n So, a, can you size in aggregate how much you think is recapturable? Is it $2 billion to $3 billion and you add another $2 billion to $3 billion on that. You're playing with a pool of savings that's really $4 billion to $6 billion over the next couple of years. So, a, is that right? And then I have a follow-up question. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, thanks for joining us today. And obviously, we're going to spend a lot more time at our investor conference talking about the efficiency initiative. But it might be helpful for us to share a couple of examples of the work that we think is in front of us. And I might ask John to start first and talk about some of the learning we've seen from a fulfillment standpoint and have Christina talked about some opportunities that we're already looking at from a merchandising standpoint. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes, Michael, I think this is -- I think, Michael Fiddelke characterized it well. This is work we always do. We've always done this. And when we look back at fulfillment, this is something we've done year after year. And I remember back in 2017, taking lots of questions about, will you guys have enough capacity in your stores to do all this fulfillment, and taking that question in 2018 and 2019. And here we are with a digital business that's 20% of our business now and 95%, 96% of our fulfillment is done in stores. \n And so when you look at what we've done there, it is essentially what Michael is talking about, continually going back, looking at the process, modifying the process, reinventing the process, investing some capital in some cases to support things like Drive-Up or extra-pack stations and consistently over that time, increasing our unit productivity as it relates to fulfillment in double digits every year since then. And that's created capacity for us to continue to drive our digital business and improved our economic performance in the digital business along the way. \n And so when we step back and look at all the scale we've gained, just like that scale we gained in the digital business that allowed us to continually improve fulfillment, we've gained all the scale now in our existing business, the broader business, and that allows us to take a step back look, at what we've been kind of doing in the last couple of years to meet our guest demand as we grew quickly and say, there's a lot of places for us to go back, reinvent process, add additional technology and improve the way we deliver for our guests. \nA. Hennington: And I would add on a similar note, we think that there is opportunity to do that same step back on how we create, make, buy, move and sell our Apparel business. You think about the exceptional growth that we've had in our business across the board, but certainly in a big category like Apparel and the volatility we've seen in import transportation lead times and ups and downs in the market. For us to take a step back and say, is there process flow, technology, planning decisions, sourcing decisions and opportunities to flow inventory with more efficiency is at the heart of this exercise. We actually have started it a while ago, and we'll really be able to accelerate the investment in that process work and reimagine the opportunity around our Apparel line. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, I want to make sure we're really clear. We see significant opportunities over the next 3 years, two, buying cost savings in the neighborhood of $2 billion to $3 billion as we improve process and simplify our operations. At the same time, we'll continue to be focused on growth and taking market share and meeting our guests and continue to enhance our business position. So it's not an either/or, it's an and. We'll continue to be focused on being a growth company, continuing to build market share, driving traffic to our stores and visit store sites and become a much more efficient organization that leverages the scale we've gained over the last 3 years. \nMichael Lasser: That's super helpful. Let me just clarify that and ask 1 follow-up question. Is the $2 billion to $3 billion on top of what you'll get from recouping the inventory write-downs, the cancellation fees that you paid to cancel orders this year? Or is that -- is $2 billion to $3 billion inclusive of that recapture opportunity?\n My second question is, do you need to make price investments in the business to improve the perception amongst customers during this difficult economic time, that is taking more front-stage discussion now that your big competitor talked about a good start to its fourth quarter? So there's discussion around whether Target might be losing share to its competitor that's perceived to be more value oriented. \nBrian Cornell: So Michael, there are a couple of questions there. One, we see the savings as being incremental for an operating plan; two, we do expect that the holiday season is going to be very promotional. We're seeing that as we move into the month of November. But as we've mentioned many times, one of the things that really stands out in our quarter is our ability to continue to hold and gain unit market share across all 5 of our merchandising categories. \n So we're continuing to build share. We're going to continue to see traffic driving our business, and we think it's going to be a promotional holiday season, and we're prepared to compete in this environment. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ed Yruma with Piper Sandler. \nEdward Yruma: I guess first, you called out shrink a number of times and I know it's been a persistent issue, but it seems like it's intensifying. Is this something you think you can remediate kind of tactically or process? Or is this kind of endemic of other structural issues, namely maybe the location of some of your newer stores and jurisdictions where maybe shrink is just more endemic? \n And then as a bigger picture question, as you look to '23, with the consumer being volatile, how quickly can you bend the merchandise offering to focus more on those entry price point or those value-seeking items that the consumer is demanding today? \nJohn Mulligan: Ed, this is John. I'll take the shrink question. I think, first, I'd say it started probably in some localized geographies originally, but we see those circles expanding and expanding and the impact continuing to grow. I think from a solutions perspective, we see 2 things. One, this is a nationwide problem that we need to address nationwide with other retailers. This is primarily driven by organized crime. And so there is a role for us to work as a retail group with law enforcement with the government to help find solutions.\n More specific to Target, there are things that we can do from a remediation standpoint. We have put those in place in a number of stores, and we see the impact of that. It's obviously not something we like to do. It's far less convenient for guests as they shop our stores, but we think we can manage that from a service perspective. \n And you can see us continue to do that. As we see stores that are more impacted, we'll continue to provide additional remediation factors. The biggest focus for us is keeping our team and our guests safe. And so we start there. And so that drives a lot of our behavior, and that's the goal. \n And then the third thing is to prevent theft. But we really start in a place where it is about keeping our team and our guests safe as they're in our stores. \nA. Hennington: And on your second question, Ed, on value, price perception and our offerings. I would tell you that we've had a concerted effort to make sure that we demonstrate the balanced value across our assortment for a long period of time. In fact, last quarter, I called it a maniacal focus on opening price points because we need to make sure that we appeal to the range of consumers that shop Target. And as I said in my prepared remarks, some of that is going to be opening price point value options that we can engineer into, especially in our strong owned brand offering. But some of it is actually larger sizes where people are seeking value through the per-unit equation that comes with bigger pack sizes. \n So we are absolutely focused on it. It comes through in everyday price, it comes through in our own brand assortment, it comes through in our promotions, and it comes to our accessibility with our great RedCard, our free loyalty programs and the solutions in aggregate. And that's part of the Target equation. It's all also relevant with the assortment that's fresh, seasonal and on trend. It doesn't matter what your priced at if the assortment is relevant. And that's why we need to always stay on-Target. \nOperator: The next question is from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: And you guys got into some good detail about the cost savings you have planned. I was wondering, is there any thought that 2023, we may have an extension of the challenges and thinking about CapEx, thinking about labor hours and how you might attack that in 2023 as the Fed is successful here and engineers a recession? \nBrian Cornell: Scott, as you might imagine, right now, we are laser focused on the holiday season and making sure we end 2022 in a position where we continue to hold and grow share and meet the needs of our guests. For the very early stages of looking at 2023, we'll be back after the first of the year with more details about our overall plans, including CapEx spending and our outlook for the overall consumer environment. \n So give us a few weeks, we'll be back to you after the first of the year, but obviously, we're going to spend a lot of time right now focused on executing our plan, getting through the holiday season and then assessing the consumer and the overall retail landscape as we look to 2023. \nScott Mushkin: So then another extension of the question, but I wanted to get a second view on this. Imitation is the best form of flattery. And one of the competitors, especially in Apparel and Home, has been copying you guys pretty readily and partnering with other brands. I mean how much do you think that could impact your sales or maybe is impacting your sales in those categories? Or do you think it's really not a factor? \nBrian Cornell: Scott, it's why we spend so much time looking at unit market share performance. And as we continue to perform well across our entire portfolio, we feel like we've got the right mix of great national brand partners that strengthen our own brands. We have a fabulous in-store experience and the ease and simplicity of our digital channels. So we think we're well positioned to continue to hold and grow share across our entire portfolio, not just in the holiday season but for years to come. \nOperator: The next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Maybe for Christina and maybe Brian can chime in here. I know it's early, but with the kind of shift in trends you're seeing, is there any more you can tell us maybe about the income demographic dissecting of your guests? Has there been any changes in patterns amongst that? So for example, Walmart obviously called out yesterday that they're seeing more of these $100,000-plus people trading into Walmart. Is there anything that you can tell us about your lower-income guests versus your middle or higher income that helps us understand what's going on? \nA. Hennington: Yes. Our first proof point about how we're performing is obviously the strength of our traffic as well as our market share gains. And those are broad, span across all of our categories. As we look at the guest and where the growth is coming from, it's coming from a deepening engagement with our current guests. And so they are coming more often, and they are spending across more categories. \n And there are a couple of inflection points in behavior with our Target guests that are really meaningful: One is when they become an omnichannel guests; the second is how much they use our fulfillment capabilities; and the third is the amount that they buy Food & Beverage. And all those 3 are growing at a faster rate than total Target. That gives us confidence that going forward, we'll continue to deepen the engagement with the guests that are most meaningful for our long-term business. \nRobert Ohmes: And then just maybe a quick follow-up. Anything on the digital side? Any new initiatives you guys would be thinking about maybe doing more with marketplace or things to get your digital growth a little higher again? \nJohn Mulligan: Well, I think there's a couple of things there. One, the digital team is doing a great job. And there -- to Brian's point, right now, they're very focused on delivering a great Q4 for our guests. I think a couple of things we are excited about is first, bringing -- and these are the top 2 requests from our guests, always being led by our guests as it relates to what we're going to provide from a digital perspective. \n Number one is adding Starbucks to Drive-Up. And we have seen that in the test stores, very, very popular. This has been a request for a long time from guests. \"I'm getting milk, I'm getting diapers, why can't I get my latte to go as well?\"\n I think the second one under the heading of continuing to create ease, and this is also a request from our guests, is being able to do returns through Drive-Up. That one's a little bit further behind Starbucks. We're testing that in a small number of stores. It just went guest-facing recently. And so we'll continue to test that through the fourth quarter here and look to hopefully expand that next year. \n But I think the example there -- the examples there are more important than what we're doing, that is the guest leading us to what they want us to provide from a digital perspective, whether that be on the site or in how we fulfill their services. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask on the sales backdrop for a minute. You took a lot of markdowns and some inventory was released to the market. Walmart had the same, and they've been discounting. Why couldn't this environment just be off-price having a lot of inventory and the market is just stuffed and that could be part of this weakness, and it's going to take some time for that to clear as opposed to the consumer really weakening in fundamentals? I just wanted to throw it out there. \nBrian Cornell: Simeon, I'll go back to some of the syndicated data that we've been looking at. And clearly, across all of retail, we saw a change in shopping behavior in the back half of October leading into November. The most recent information we've seen from NPD would indicate during the first week of November, general merchandise categories contracted by 14%. So a very significant change in shopping behavior. \n So I think, as Christina pointed out a number of times, we've had a consumer who has been dealing with very stubborn inflation for quarter after quarter now. They're certainly starting to look at higher prices in Food & Beverage, in many cases, prices that are up double digits. They're shopping very carefully on a budget. And I think they're looking at discretionary categories and saying, \"All right, if I'm going to buy, I'm looking for a great deal and a great value.\"\n So what we've seen overall is a change in consumer behavior over the last few weeks. We're going to watch it carefully throughout the holiday season, but I think it is a byproduct of a consumer who has been facing higher costs throughout the year, is working with their budget, shopping very carefully, looking for value and recognize they've got to start with core staples before they spend dollars in discretionary categories. \nSimeon Gutman: Yes. That makes sense. And my follow-up is the $2 billion to $3 billion, it sounds like it's process oriented. But some of the things you mentioned in terms of flowing inventory, it seems like that will require CapEx. And again, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but to be able to drive these efficiencies, is it pure process? Or does CapEx need to step up to make investments in order to realize the savings? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. It's a fair question, Simeon. And sometimes it involves CapEx, and we're happy to invest that CapEx when the return is there. And so if we can put capital into the business that can drive efficiency for the team, I think you've seen us do that with technology in stores and supply chain, so that's a path we've been on, and we certainly aren't shy about making that investment when the return is there. But it won't all require capital. There's a lot of process reengineering and optimization that we can do that shouldn't have a capital price tag associated with it. \n And again, back to the examples John and Christina provided, so much of that is about the scale we've gained. There's a path of simplifying and taking costs out of the business when you don't have growth. We've got the fortunate position to be looking at the business on the heels of just exceptional growth and that creates a lot of opportunity for us to rebuild process against the business that's substantially bigger than it was a few years ago. \nBrian Cornell: Operator, we got time for one last question today. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on the inventory position, just if there was any inventory left over from the issues that you experienced in the spring. And now that it sounds like maybe Q4 is going to be a little bit weaker, but I think the inventories you probably bought was for more of a low single-digit comp scenario, is the goal to be clean with regards to holiday inventory coming out of Q4 and into 2023? \nMichael Fiddelke: I will answer that with where you ended your question, Kate, and that is we are committed to being clean at the end of the holiday season. And you're also right in the first half of your question. We accomplished what we wanted to in the first half of the year. We feel good about that work. And you heard me quote some versus 2019 benchmarks. If you were to just look versus last year, you'll see that Q2, out inventory was up 36% year-on-year; in Q3, it's about 14%. And so we made good progress on the plans we had in place. Obviously, we're looking at the change in the trends closely. If that trend we see persists, it will come with more markdowns to make sure we accomplish exactly that goal of ending the season clean. \nBrian Cornell: Operator, that concludes our third quarter call. We wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season and look forward to seeing you in person in 2023. So thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. Across the operations team, we focus every day on delivering strong execution, even as we continue to keep our eyes on and invest in projects that will support Target's long-term profitable growth. As you know, throughout the year, our supply chain and transportation teams have been continuously navigating through an unpredictable environment, and these volatile conditions continued in the third quarter. The good news is that the lead times in global shipping has started to move in the right direction. More specifically, compared with the second quarter, lead times improved by about 15% in Q3, and we're more than 3 weeks shorter than a year ago. \n While we were really pleased to see this improvement, the acceleration was faster than we expected, causing many overseas orders to arrive earlier than needed. As a result, the team has been reducing lead times on our future orders just as they extended them during the pandemic. \n In addition, to prevent early arrivals from entering our distribution and store network before they are needed, the team has implemented multiple strategies and tactics, including new processes to efficiently segment shipping containers as they arrive at domestic ports, allowing early arriving containers to age before sending them downstream into our regional distribution centers. \n So today, even as we continue to look heavy on the balance sheet, our inventory is in a much healthier position than earlier in the year. Because the heaviness you're seeing today is due to the early arrival of fresh inventory, we are planning to sell. For example, by early November of this year, nearly 90% of our key Q4 programs had already moved into our distribution centers and stores. In contrast, last year, just over half our key programs were in the network as of the same time frame. \n Similar to our experience with lead times, we saw improvement across multiple dimensions of our transportation costs in the quarter, even as those costs remain above pre-pandemic levels. Container rates in global shipping have come down by about 1/3 in recent months, and we'll realize that benefit in 2023 as we renegotiate our staggered contracts with shipping partners. And importantly, we expect to see further reductions in those rates going forward as they remain about 3x higher than we were paying in 2019. \n Similarly, domestic transportation rates have come down since the beginning of the year, but remain higher than a year ago and double the rates we were facing in 2019. And of course, fuel costs, which are a major driver of our domestic transportation expense are still running more than double the amount we were paying in 2019 despite having moderated in recent months. \n Now I'll turn to the work of our properties team, where we're still wrapping up some projects but close to completing our supply chain and store projects for the year. On the distribution side, we're continuing our work to build replenishment capacity across the country, given the amount of growth we've delivered over the last few years. \n The other big addition to our distribution infrastructure is the build-out of our sortation center strategy. A year ago, we were operating a single sort center here in the Minneapolis market. And this year, we've opened 5 more with several more on track to open in 2023. These centers, which are typically a little bigger than a single store, increase our speed and meaningfully reduce our last-mile delivery costs in the markets where they operate. They also create backroom fulfillment capacity in the stores they serve, as they eliminate the need for each individual store to sort the boxes they've packed for delivery. \n On the store side, we are on track to complete about 200 full remodel projects this year in which we update every part of the store to reflect our latest thinking and offer a modern and inspirational shopping experience for our guests. Beyond full remodels, we're also on track to complete about 200 fulfillment retrofits this year in which we optimize their capacity and efficiency in supporting our same-day services. \n And finally, the team is on track to complete our new store program for 2022, in which we plan to add 23 new locations to the chain. The size of these new stores ranges widely from 19,000 to 145,000 square feet as we continue to open the right size store for the neighborhood we're serving. And as we've mentioned in recent calls, based on evolving conditions in the commercial real estate market, we've been finding more and more opportunities to open larger locations that can offer the full range of our assortment, along with a full suite of fulfillment options to serve our guests. \n In light of that opportunity, just over a week ago, we opened the first example of a new larger store prototype in the Houston, Texas market. At nearly 150,000 square feet, this new format incorporates our latest thinking in store design, featuring a more open layout, localized elements to inspire and serve our guests, 5x more space to support our digital fulfillment services and sustainable features in support of our Target-forward goals. While we'll continue to open new stores of all sizes in the next few years, we plan to lean into this new layout when appropriate and incorporate its features into other projects, including remodels. \n Among the many innovations we've incorporated into this new location in Houston, we've added 2 new Drive-Up services. The first is the ability for a guest to order a beverage from Starbucks on their way to pick up their Drive-Up order. We started testing this new service in the second quarter with a limited menu in a small number of stores, allowing us to collect feedback and fine-tune operations before expanding it more broadly. Based on the success of that pilot, earlier this month, we rolled it out to more than 200 additional stores across the country, just in time for the holidays. \n The other emerging capability is the ability for a guest to return a purchase through our Drive-Up service. We began testing this service only a month ago with our team members in a small number of stores, consistent with our test-and-iterate approach. Based on the operational success of that initial test, in early November, we expanded the service to our guests in that same small set of stores, and we'll look to apply any learnings from that guest-facing test before rolling out the service more broadly next year. \n So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams across the country who have worked tirelessly to ensure we are staffed and ready to serve our guests during the upcoming holiday season, our busiest time of the year. Consistent with prior years, before determining our seasonal hiring goals, we focused first on providing opportunities to our existing team to support their desired hours and backup training interests. \n And today, based on all that hard work in preparation, I'm happy to report that we're entering the holiday season in a very healthy staffing position, reflecting our success in hiring throughout the year, the significant wage investments we've made throughout the country, an increase in the number of team members who are looking to pick up extra hours and an 18% increase in applicants for seasonal positions compared with a year ago. \n As Brian mentioned, it's in times like these that we feel most fortunate to have a durable business model, which can sustain us through an ever more challenging economic and consumer backdrop and allow us to emerge with additional profitable growth and market share opportunities over time. That's why we're ensuring our teams are staying focused on our guests and taking the right actions to continue deepening our relationship with them. If we maintain that guest focus, I'm confident we'll find ourselves in an even stronger competitive position over time. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Yes, Michael, I think this is -- I think, Michael Fiddelke characterized it well. This is work we always do. We've always done this. And when we look back at fulfillment, this is something we've done year after year. And I remember back in 2017, taking lots of questions about, will you guys have enough capacity in your stores to do all this fulfillment, and taking that question in 2018 and 2019. And here we are with a digital business that's 20% of our business now and 95%, 96% of our fulfillment is done in stores. \n And so when you look at what we've done there, it is essentially what Michael is talking about, continually going back, looking at the process, modifying the process, reinventing the process, investing some capital in some cases to support things like Drive-Up or extra-pack stations and consistently over that time, increasing our unit productivity as it relates to fulfillment in double digits every year since then. And that's created capacity for us to continue to drive our digital business and improved our economic performance in the digital business along the way. \n And so when we step back and look at all the scale we've gained, just like that scale we gained in the digital business that allowed us to continually improve fulfillment, we've gained all the scale now in our existing business, the broader business, and that allows us to take a step back look, at what we've been kind of doing in the last couple of years to meet our guest demand as we grew quickly and say, there's a lot of places for us to go back, reinvent process, add additional technology and improve the way we deliver for our guests. Ed, this is John. I'll take the shrink question. I think, first, I'd say it started probably in some localized geographies originally, but we see those circles expanding and expanding and the impact continuing to grow. I think from a solutions perspective, we see 2 things. One, this is a nationwide problem that we need to address nationwide with other retailers. This is primarily driven by organized crime. And so there is a role for us to work as a retail group with law enforcement with the government to help find solutions.\n More specific to Target, there are things that we can do from a remediation standpoint. We have put those in place in a number of stores, and we see the impact of that. It's obviously not something we like to do. It's far less convenient for guests as they shop our stores, but we think we can manage that from a service perspective. \n And you can see us continue to do that. As we see stores that are more impacted, we'll continue to provide additional remediation factors. The biggest focus for us is keeping our team and our guests safe. And so we start there. And so that drives a lot of our behavior, and that's the goal. \n And then the third thing is to prevent theft. But we really start in a place where it is about keeping our team and our guests safe as they're in our stores. Well, I think there's a couple of things there. One, the digital team is doing a great job. And there -- to Brian's point, right now, they're very focused on delivering a great Q4 for our guests. I think a couple of things we are excited about is first, bringing -- and these are the top 2 requests from our guests, always being led by our guests as it relates to what we're going to provide from a digital perspective. \n Number one is adding Starbucks to Drive-Up. And we have seen that in the test stores, very, very popular. This has been a request for a long time from guests. \"I'm getting milk, I'm getting diapers, why can't I get my latte to go as well?\"\n I think the second one under the heading of continuing to create ease, and this is also a request from our guests, is being able to do returns through Drive-Up. That one's a little bit further behind Starbucks. We're testing that in a small number of stores. It just went guest-facing recently. And so we'll continue to test that through the fourth quarter here and look to hopefully expand that next year. \n But I think the example there -- the examples there are more important than what we're doing, that is the guest leading us to what they want us to provide from a digital perspective, whether that be on the site or in how we fulfill their services."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John. As I begin the call today, I want to highlight the proactive leadership position we will continue to take as the operating environment changes. Just as we took decisive action in the second quarter to rightsize our inventory, we're moving proactively in a period of rapidly softening demand and elevated uncertainty to successfully navigate near-term challenges alongside our team and in step with our guests. \n As we look specifically at third quarter results, they demonstrate how our business continues to serve our guests even in the face of an increasingly challenging backdrop. Because of the deepening level of trust we've established with our guests over the last several years, our top line continues to benefit from growth in guest traffic and unit share gains across all of our core categories. This is particularly notable as consumers are showing increasing signs of stress and pulling back from discretionary purchases, and it reinforces the value of having a balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to satisfy our guests' ever-changing needs. \n In today's environment, that means we continue to benefit from strong growth and market share gains in the categories our guests are leaning into most right now, including Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials. Q3 comparable sales grew 2.7% on top of 12.7% a year ago and 20.7% in the third quarter of 2020. \n As you recall, early in the second quarter, we announced we would be taking decisive inventory actions based on the rapid change in consumer buying patterns that emerged near the end of the first quarter. These actions were designed to ensure we could continue to provide what our guests know and love about Target. More specifically, the effort was designed to free up space in our stores and hours for our team to continue offering fresh inventory and a reliable, uncluttered shopping experience for our guests, setting up our business to deliver strong growth in Q3. \n Among the drivers of our comparable sales, third quarter traffic expanded 1.4% on top of 12.9% growth a year ago. In addition to traffic growth, we saw a 1.3% increase in average ticket as guests continue to rely on Target for convenient, reliable one-stop shop. Across our merchandise categories and similar to the second quarter, we saw a very strong growth in our frequency businesses, led by double-digit growth in both Beauty and Food & Beverage. That strength offset persistent softness in our discretionary categories, which worsened at the end of the quarter. Christina will provide more detail in a few minutes. \n While overall Q3 comp growth was nearly identical to our second quarter performance, we experienced dramatically different trends within the quarter. More specifically, through the first 2 months of the quarter, we had seen comp growth of well over 3%, and then saw a deceleration to just under 1% in October. \n Even within the month of October results in the back half of the month were much softer than in the first half and the mix of our sales tilted much more heavily towards promotions. This rapid change in trend is consistent with what we're seeing in syndicated data on broader industry trends and the feedback we're hearing from our guests. More specifically, consumers are feeling increasing levels of stress, driven by persistently high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and an elevated sense of uncertainty about their economic prospects. \n With high rates of inflation contouring the road, their purchasing power, many consumers this year have relied on borrowing or dipping into their savings to manage their weekly budgets. But for many consumers, those options are starting to run out. As a result, our guests are exhibiting increasing price sensitivity, becoming more focused on and responsive to promotions and more hesitant to purchase at full price. \n On the profit line, we saw an expected improvement in the third quarter as we move beyond the bulk of those costs from our second quarter inventory actions. However, Q3 profitability came in well below our expectations, driven by several factors. First and foremost, we faced an unexpected gross margin rate headwind from a higher-than-expected mix of promotional sales as guests moved away from full price purchases. \n In addition, like the rest of the industry, we're facing a growing financial headwind from shortage, which is running hundreds of millions of dollars higher than a year ago. Along with other retailers, we've seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business. As a result, we're making significant investments in training and technology that can deter that and keep our guests and store team members safe. \n Looking ahead and taking recent trends into account, our team is making adjustments in real time with agility and flexibility in light of the revised expectations for both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. It's in tough environments like these that we're most fortunate to have a durable business model and a strong balance sheet, allowing us to maintain our focus on long-term investments and market share opportunities at a time when many others will be forced to pull back. And to create additional capacity for us to continue investing in long-term growth and market share while also delivering strong bottom line performance, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to identify opportunities to simplify and enhance the efficiencies of our business. \n I want to make it clear. This effort is not about slashing resources. Instead, it's about optimizing our operations to match the scale of our business. This effort is particularly important today because of the rapid and unanticipated level of scale our business is added since 2019 as total revenues have grown from less than $80 billion in 2019 to a projection of well over $100 billion this year. \n While our team has done an excellent job of staying agile and quickly accommodating all that growth. We now have an opportunity to look from top to bottom across all of our operations to ensure they are fully optimized for the size of our business. We're still in the process of fully scoping out this effort, but we believe it presents an opportunity to save a total of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next 3 years in support of our investments in long-term growth, along with our profit goals. \n In the near term, our team is energized and laser-focused on bringing the best of Target to our guests throughout the holiday season, knowing it's critically important for Target to be there for them during the busiest time of the year. Our team is committed to offering value across our entire assortment through great everyday prices, unbeatable value on our owned brands and accessible opening price points in every category. \n In addition, we'll highlight our compelling and simple promotions, free services like Drive-Up and in-store pickup and new accessible payment options. And of course, we'll provide additional savings opportunities through our RedCard and Target Circle programs, neither of which has a membership fee. \n So as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank the entire Target team for your energy, your spirit, your care for each other and your passion for our guests and our brand. You're the reason that Target has such a positive impact on the communities where we live and work and the reason we're known as a welcoming and inclusive brand. \n Thank you, and happy holidays to all of you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. Before we turn to your questions, I want to relay a few thoughts that I shared with our Target team earlier today. While the circumstances we're facing are difficult and certainly not what anyone would wish for, we need to embrace the moment, focus on what we can control and lean into our strengths. Because even as we face multiple challenges, all at the same time, we have an even longer list of strengths on our side. And there are quite a few headwinds, but we've shown time and time again that our strengths can overcome any challenge we face. \n We have nearly 2,000 well-located, well-maintained store locations. We have a rapidly growing set of owned brands that are already generating more than $30 billion in annual sales. And we have a unique and growing list of national brand partners, including Starbucks, CVS Health, Levi's, Apple, Disney and Ulta Beauty. \n Our unmatched product design, development and sourcing capabilities allow us to offer an unbeatable combination of price, quality, design and fashion throughout our own brand portfolio. We have a durable operating model and a balanced portfolio of merchandise categories, which allow us to pivot quickly in a rapidly changing environment. \n Our operations are profitable, generate robust cash flow and are backed by a strong balance sheet that enables continued investment during lean times. And of course, we have a unique, amazing, passionate team that has only grown stronger over the last few years. So this morning, I've asked our team to focus on what they do best, moving with agility and responding to the environment in real time, delivering outstanding execution throughout the holiday season and beyond and doing it all as one team, aligned in support of our guests and each other. \n While we'd all prefer to be operating in a more robust environment, today, we have the opportunity and all the resources we need to continue playing offense while many others cannot. By harnessing the strength of our assets and our amazing team I'm confident we'll continue to grow guest engagement and deliver compelling growth on both the top and bottom line over time. \n With that, we can move to Q&A. Now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Chris, did you have a second question? Michael, thanks for joining us today. And obviously, we're going to spend a lot more time at our investor conference talking about the efficiency initiative. But it might be helpful for us to share a couple of examples of the work that we think is in front of us. And I might ask John to start first and talk about some of the learning we've seen from a fulfillment standpoint and have Christina talked about some opportunities that we're already looking at from a merchandising standpoint. Michael, I want to make sure we're really clear. We see significant opportunities over the next 3 years, two, buying cost savings in the neighborhood of $2 billion to $3 billion as we improve process and simplify our operations. At the same time, we'll continue to be focused on growth and taking market share and meeting our guests and continue to enhance our business position. So it's not an either/or, it's an and. We'll continue to be focused on being a growth company, continuing to build market share, driving traffic to our stores and visit store sites and become a much more efficient organization that leverages the scale we've gained over the last 3 years. So Michael, there are a couple of questions there. One, we see the savings as being incremental for an operating plan; two, we do expect that the holiday season is going to be very promotional. We're seeing that as we move into the month of November. But as we've mentioned many times, one of the things that really stands out in our quarter is our ability to continue to hold and gain unit market share across all 5 of our merchandising categories. \n So we're continuing to build share. We're going to continue to see traffic driving our business, and we think it's going to be a promotional holiday season, and we're prepared to compete in this environment. Scott, as you might imagine, right now, we are laser focused on the holiday season and making sure we end 2022 in a position where we continue to hold and grow share and meet the needs of our guests. For the very early stages of looking at 2023, we'll be back after the first of the year with more details about our overall plans, including CapEx spending and our outlook for the overall consumer environment. \n So give us a few weeks, we'll be back to you after the first of the year, but obviously, we're going to spend a lot of time right now focused on executing our plan, getting through the holiday season and then assessing the consumer and the overall retail landscape as we look to 2023. Scott, it's why we spend so much time looking at unit market share performance. And as we continue to perform well across our entire portfolio, we feel like we've got the right mix of great national brand partners that strengthen our own brands. We have a fabulous in-store experience and the ease and simplicity of our digital channels. So we think we're well positioned to continue to hold and grow share across our entire portfolio, not just in the holiday season but for years to come. Simeon, I'll go back to some of the syndicated data that we've been looking at. And clearly, across all of retail, we saw a change in shopping behavior in the back half of October leading into November. The most recent information we've seen from NPD would indicate during the first week of November, general merchandise categories contracted by 14%. So a very significant change in shopping behavior. \n So I think, as Christina pointed out a number of times, we've had a consumer who has been dealing with very stubborn inflation for quarter after quarter now. They're certainly starting to look at higher prices in Food & Beverage, in many cases, prices that are up double digits. They're shopping very carefully on a budget. And I think they're looking at discretionary categories and saying, \"All right, if I'm going to buy, I'm looking for a great deal and a great value.\"\n So what we've seen overall is a change in consumer behavior over the last few weeks. We're going to watch it carefully throughout the holiday season, but I think it is a byproduct of a consumer who has been facing higher costs throughout the year, is working with their budget, shopping very carefully, looking for value and recognize they've got to start with core staples before they spend dollars in discretionary categories. Operator, we got time for one last question today. Operator, that concludes our third quarter call. We wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season and look forward to seeing you in person in 2023. So thank you."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The current retail environment requires tremendous levels of flexibility, resilience, stamina and focus, a balance our team continues to carry out at every guest interaction. Consumers are strained as they work to support their families' day-to-day needs while looking for the occasional affordable luxury, prepping for the changing seasons and planning for the holidays. \n It's a difficult balance to strike in getting increasingly difficult each week as more and more of their household budget goes towards the needs of the family, which limits the amount available for discretionary purchases. So it follows that of the many considerations that our guests are currently juggling, we consistently hear that value remains at the top of the list. We see our guests holding out for and expecting promotions more than ever, spending less on regularly priced items. \n When they shop our frequency categories, some guests are trading into smaller pack sizes, opening price point options or owned brands to reduce their spending on a single trip. Others are opting for larger pack sizes or stocking up when items are on promotion, knowing they will receive greater per unit value. And these trends only became more pronounced towards the end of the third quarter when spending patterns change dramatically. \n With inflationary food prices absorbing more of their spending, those costs are crowding out other categories, including spending on discretionary items, and in some cases, even household essentials. However, we also know both from our recent performance and from guest surveys that despite the pressures they're facing, our guests want to celebrate the holidays in person with loved ones, and they're looking for Target to provide them safety, ease and joy as they prepare for every celebration. \n These themes played out in the third quarter as guests responded increasingly to promotions, even as they celebrated key seasonal moments like back-to-school, college and Halloween. Among our frequency categories, Beauty continues to drive strong performance, delivering sales growth in the mid-teens. Skin care, hair care and cosmetics, all performed very well and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings nearly tripled their total sales volume when compared to this period a year ago. \n Food & Beverage continues to outperform the market with low double-digit growth and strength across the portfolio, gaining both dollar and unit share every week throughout the quarter. Comparable sales in Essentials categories grew in the low single digits, reflecting particular strength in pets and health. \n While already soft, sales trends in our discretionary categories softened even more in the last few weeks of the quarter, a trend that's persisted into the first few weeks of November. But importantly, despite this challenging environment, we still saw unit share gains in all 5 of our core merchandising categories in the quarter, a sign that when guests are looking for convenience and value on both wants and needs, they're increasingly turning to Target. \n Apparel comps were down only slightly in Q3, driven by growth in kids, men's, seasonal and new fashion forward assortments, offset by softness in swim, women's accessories and basics. In Home, sales declined in the mid-single digits despite strong performance in seasonal areas. Hardlines sales were also down mid-single digits reflecting continued softness in home electronics and sporting goods. Additionally, we saw a meaningful deceleration in toys this quarter, most notably in October. This is a trend we will continue to monitor closely as we move throughout the holiday season. \n Across the portfolio, owned brands continue to outperform their national brand counterparts, growing at double the rate of the total enterprise in the third quarter. Because of our unique industry-leading, in-house design and sourcing capabilities, Target's exclusive owned brands provide tremendous quality at incredibly competitive prices, a great combination anytime but never more so than in an inflationary environment. \n So as we turn our focus to Q4, we'll do what we always do, work tirelessly to deliver value and solutions to our guests while also delivering affordable joy at a time when they need it most. As we've outlined this morning, we're taking a prudent approach to our inventory planning and sales expectations for the fourth quarter in light of the concerning industry trends we've seen over the past several weeks. But even with this cautious stance, we're focused on providing our guests with affordability and ease at every interaction with the Target brand. \n One of the signature ways we plan to stand out this holiday season is through our focus on the combination of newness and value, which cut across all our core categories. Given that the gift-giving season is underway and our guests are turning to Target more and more for their Food & Beverage needs, it's an ideal time for our recently announced partnership with British retailer, Marks & Spencer, who has collaborated with us to offer a limited time assortment of gourmet, premium food and chocolates, that's sure to be a perfect gifting solution this holiday season. \n Despite recent trends in toys, we know they will play a critical role for our guests over the holiday season, and we have all the top toys and exclusives this year at incredible prices. Back by popular demand, our exclusive assortment from FAO Schwartz features more than 120 toys. And for all the Marvel fans out there, the first of its kind collaboration between Target and Disney will feature exclusive Black Panther merchandise and experiences, including the only-at-Target, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever War on the Water LEGO set. \n And the power of these partnerships doesn't stop there. We've added nearly 50 Disney shop-in-shop experiences this year, bringing the total to well over 200 of these shops across the country. In partnership with Apple, we've more than tripled the number of shop-in-shops since last year, and our Target Circle members have access to free trials of some incredible Apple services, including a free 4-month trial of Apple Fitness+. And with Ulta Beauty at Target, we'll have opened another 250 locations this year and now have more than 350 locations open across the chain. \n Through all our new tried-and-true and exclusive holiday offerings, we'll remain laser-focused on supporting our value proposition with key deals starting earlier than ever. Week-long Black Friday deals and our guest-favorite Deal of the Day offers are available now and feature our best plan prices for the season, with prices up to 50% off across toys and games, electronics, kitchen appliances and more. Besides industry-leading promotions, we are offering compelling, easy to shop, everyday price points on key items like $3 Christmas ornaments, $5 holiday Wondershop and candle assortments, and $10 gifting assortments across categories like Beauty, Apparel and Home. \n And to reinforce our commitment to value, we'll be offering free and easy payment and fulfillment options, including our recently launched reloadable RedCard, which provides all the benefits of our RedCard debit and credit programs, including free shipping and 5% off every purchase, all without the need for a credit check or an existing bank account. Combine this with our easy, convenient and free same-day service options like Drive-Up and order pickup, all with no membership fees and our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle, we have an unmatched combination of value-added and affordable shopping experiences to help our guests celebrate and amplify the joy of the holidays.  \n Throughout the season, we will remain nimble and respond to changes in consumer promotional and macro trends, always in service of optimizing current and long-term performance. And despite the challenges facing our business and our guests, we have a not-so-secret-weapon to help us provide joy and value for our guests, a world-class team. Like Brian, I want to pause and add my sincere gratitude for the Target team. No matter what is thrown your way, you execute with grace compassion and consistency, a combination that leads our guests to return to our stores and website time and time again. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. And I would add on a similar note, we think that there is opportunity to do that same step back on how we create, make, buy, move and sell our Apparel business. You think about the exceptional growth that we've had in our business across the board, but certainly in a big category like Apparel and the volatility we've seen in import transportation lead times and ups and downs in the market. For us to take a step back and say, is there process flow, technology, planning decisions, sourcing decisions and opportunities to flow inventory with more efficiency is at the heart of this exercise. We actually have started it a while ago, and we'll really be able to accelerate the investment in that process work and reimagine the opportunity around our Apparel line. And on your second question, Ed, on value, price perception and our offerings. I would tell you that we've had a concerted effort to make sure that we demonstrate the balanced value across our assortment for a long period of time. In fact, last quarter, I called it a maniacal focus on opening price points because we need to make sure that we appeal to the range of consumers that shop Target. And as I said in my prepared remarks, some of that is going to be opening price point value options that we can engineer into, especially in our strong owned brand offering. But some of it is actually larger sizes where people are seeking value through the per-unit equation that comes with bigger pack sizes. \n So we are absolutely focused on it. It comes through in everyday price, it comes through in our own brand assortment, it comes through in our promotions, and it comes to our accessibility with our great RedCard, our free loyalty programs and the solutions in aggregate. And that's part of the Target equation. It's all also relevant with the assortment that's fresh, seasonal and on trend. It doesn't matter what your priced at if the assortment is relevant. And that's why we need to always stay on-Target. Yes. Our first proof point about how we're performing is obviously the strength of our traffic as well as our market share gains. And those are broad, span across all of our categories. As we look at the guest and where the growth is coming from, it's coming from a deepening engagement with our current guests. And so they are coming more often, and they are spending across more categories. \n And there are a couple of inflection points in behavior with our Target guests that are really meaningful: One is when they become an omnichannel guests; the second is how much they use our fulfillment capabilities; and the third is the amount that they buy Food & Beverage. And all those 3 are growing at a faster rate than total Target. That gives us confidence that going forward, we'll continue to deepen the engagement with the guests that are most meaningful for our long-term business."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I want to start where John just ended and reiterate how closely we're listening to our guests, ensuring we understand how they're feeling and how that is affecting their shopping behavior and moving quickly to serve their rapidly-changing needs. Obviously, if recent softening consumer trends continue through the fourth quarter, that will put some pressure on our near-term financial performance. But with a durable model and an agile team, we can navigate those challenges and emerge even stronger in the long term while continuing to deepen our relationship with guests and build long-term preference for Target. \n Once again, this quarter, I'm going to begin my remarks by covering our inventory position, given that it continues to be an important area of focus. And like last quarter, I'm going to base my discussion on comparisons to 2019, given the highly volatile conditions that have affected inventory since the onset of the pandemic. \n As you saw on our balance sheet this morning, we owned $17.1 billion of inventory at the end of the third quarter, which is $5.7 billion higher than the end of Q3 2019. In percentage terms, this year's number represents an approximate 50% increase from 3 years ago, a deceleration from 3-year growth of 68% as of the end of the second quarter. \n Of the dollar increase in our inventory since 2019, about 2/3 or $3.9 billion is aligned with our sales growth over that same 3-year period. The remaining 1/3 or about $1.8 billion is new inventory that's arrived early relative to when it would have been received in pre-pandemic years. \n This early inventory is being driven by 2 related factors. The first is our explicit decision to add cushion to our lead times this year in order to mitigate the risk we were facing a year ago when the bulk of our global shipments were arriving late. The second factor is the unexpectedly rapid acceleration in the global supply chain that we saw in Q3, which caused us to receive shipments even earlier than scheduled. \n It's also important to note that the composition of our inventory continues to evolve as we've leaned into frequency categories where we're seeing robust growth and taken an increasingly cautious position in discretionary categories. More specifically, the percent of our inventory units in discretionary categories was 8 percentage points lower than at the end of Q2 and lower than in 2019 as well. \n With that context, I'll turn to our third quarter financial performance, beginning with the top line. Total sales grew 3.3% in the third quarter, the same as in Q2, driven by a 2.7% increase in comparable sales, combined with the benefit of new stores. Total revenue grew 3.4% in Q3, reflecting a 9.5% increase in other revenue, which was driven by the growth in our Roundel ad business. Traffic continues to be an important driver of our growth, having expanded 1.4% in Q3 on top of nearly 13% growth a year ago. In addition, this quarter, we benefited from a 1.3% increase in average ticket. \n Among our sales channels, stores continue to drive our growth as we saw a 3.2% increase in store comparable sales in Q3 on top of nearly 10% growth a year ago. Comparable sales in our digital channel grew 0.3% in the quarter on top of nearly 30% last year. Same-day services led our digital growth, most notably through our Drive-Up service, which delivered high single-digit growth on top of more than 80% growth last year. \n As Brian mentioned, while our overall Q3 comp increase was consistent with Q2, we saw a dramatic change in the pace and composition of our business toward the end of the third quarter. More specifically, within the quarter, comparable sales grew 2.8% in August, rose to 4% in September and decelerated to 0.9% in October. Also notable, even within the October period, there was a dramatic change in the pace of our sales. \n As you'll recall, the month began with an initial round of holiday promotions from Target and some of our competitors, and in that week, we saw a high single-digit increase in comp sales compared with last year. However, for the remainder of the month, we saw a low single-digit decline in comp sales over those last 3 weeks. \n Nearly all of the slowdown was driven by our discretionary categories, Apparel, Home and Hardlines, as our guests became increasingly cautious in their spending in those categories at both Target and throughout the industry more broadly. So far in the month of November, trends have been largely consistent with what we were seeing at the end of October, in terms of our comp trends, the mix of sales between frequency and discretionary businesses and the focus on promotions by our guests. \n While our Q3 gross margin rate of 24.7% was more than 3 percentage points higher than in Q2, it came in far short of our expectations, driven by 3 factors. The primary driver was a higher-than-expected markdown impact from promotions as our guests became increasingly price-sensitive and concentrated their discretionary spending on items on promotion, most notably in the latter weeks of the quarter. While we anticipated a highly promotional environment this fall, given the excess inventory we had been seeing across retail, this enhanced focus on promotions reflects an increasing level of stress on consumers as they navigate through multiple headwinds, including persistent inflation and rapidly rising interest rates. \n A second factor that's impacting our gross margin is inventory shortage, or shrink, which is a growing problem facing all retailers. At Target year-to-date, incremental shortage has already reduced our gross margin by more than $400 million versus last year, and we expect it will reduce our gross margin by more than $600 million for the full year. \n As Brian mentioned, this is an industry-wide problem that is often driven by criminal networks, and we are collaborating with multiple stakeholders to find industry-wide solutions. For example, because stolen goods are often sold online, Target strongly supports the passage of legislation to increase accountability and prevent criminals from selling stolen goods through online marketplaces. \n A third factor that affected our Q3 gross margin was the incremental cost of managing early inventory. In the near term, these pressures should begin to recede as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year as receipt flow naturally moderates following the holiday season and we'll begin to benefit from the reduction in order lead times John mentioned earlier. \n And finally, regarding gross margin, category mix moved from being a slight headwind in Q2 to a small tailwind in Q3, contributing about 20 basis points of gross margin benefit in the quarter. This change in mix impact might seem counterintuitive given some of the category trends I highlighted earlier. However, underneath the surface of discretionary comps when compared to our second quarter results, comp sales in Apparel, a high-margin discretionary category got stronger in Q3, while comps in Hardlines, a lower-margin discretionary category saw a deceleration in the third quarter. \n Moving down to the SG&A expense line. We saw a small amount of deleverage in Q3, even as we continue to benefit from disciplined cost management across the organization. In spite of that discipline, we're facing inflationary cost pressures across multiple expense lines in the P&L. Within compensation, expenses reflect ongoing investments in hourly team member pay and benefits, partially offset by a year-over-year rate benefit from lower incentive compensation expense. \n Altogether, on the operating income line, on both a dollar and rate basis, we saw a year-over-year decline of about 50% in the third quarter. I want to emphasize that we're not happy with this performance and expect to deliver much stronger dollar and rate performance over time. \n Now I want to turn to capital deployment. And as always, I'll start by reiterating our priorities, which have been consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support our dividend and build on our 50-year record of annual dividend increases. And finally, we devote any excess cash beyond these first 2 uses to repurchase our shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Beginning with our first priority, capital expenditures have come in at about $4.3 billion through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we're now expecting our full year CapEx will come in around $5.5 billion in light of continued inflationary pressures affecting the cost of this year's projects. We paid just under $500 million in dividends in the third quarter, up from $440 million a year ago, reflecting a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in our average share count. \n And finally, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter, given current financial performance and the working capital investments we've made to support in-stocks and early receipts. In the near term, we will continue to take a very cautious approach to share repurchase in light of the volatility of the environment and our commitment to maintaining our middle A credit ratings. \n So now I want to close my Q3 review with a discussion of our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months of the third quarter of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 14.6% compared with 31.3% a year ago. While this is a disappointing decline, a mid-teens after-tax return on capital is still very healthy in absolute terms and a testament to the durability of our business. Importantly, we expect to see a significant recovery from this number over time as we move beyond the unusual headwinds that have been affecting our business this year. \n Now let me turn briefly to our expectations for the fourth quarter. In the current environment, we're facing an even higher degree of uncertainty than a quarter ago given the volatility we've been seeing recently. And in light of the dramatic changes in shopping patterns we've seen both at Target and across the industry, we believe it's prudent to plan for a wide range of comparable sales outcomes in the fourth quarter that's centered around a low single-digit comp decline, consistent with recent trends. \n Underlying the sales expectation, we're planning for softer discretionary category comps than we've seen in the last 2 quarters, partially offset by the benefit of continued strong growth in our frequency businesses. If these sales trends persist, we'd see far less of a benefit from leverage on fixed expenses than we've seen so far this year. \n In addition, we'd expect greater markdown pressure from Q4 promotions given the increase in price sensitivity our guests have shown recently and our commitments to end the year with a clean inventory position, especially in those categories where trends have softened. And as I mentioned, we're planning for additional pressure from inventory shrink, given the worsening trends that have emerged so far this year. \n Altogether, these expectations lead to a wide range for our expected Q4 operating margin rate centered around 3%. The single-most sensitive input to this profit projection is the level of demand for our discretionary businesses. If that demand improves from recent trends, we would expect fewer markdowns and would likely outperform our updated profit expectations; while if demand softened further, profit could see additional pressure. \n As we look beyond the holiday season, we're planning for a continued challenging environment as we move into next year. And as John and Brian already pointed out, we are fortunate to have a durable model that is well positioned to continue serving our guests even in the toughest of times. In addition, we have a significant opportunity to harness efficiencies in support of our long-term growth and profit goals. \n At the end of 2019, our operations had been built to support a business that delivered $77 billion in sales that year. And our long-term algorithm at the time was anticipating low single-digit top line growth in the years ahead. If things had played out that way, we might be looking at a total sales number in the low to mid-$80 billion range this year. Instead, even in the midst of a very challenging environment, we're positioned to deliver total sales of well over $100 million this year. \n So today, we have a compelling opportunity to look across our operations with an eye to simplifying and optimizing those operations for a more than $100 billion business. And today, as we look at the operations we have and where we think they can be, we believe there's a $2 billion to $3 billion savings opportunity over the next 3 years. \n To be clear, this isn't about slashing resources. And in particular, we're focused on continuing to invest in our team, which is our most valuable asset. As Brian said, we are in the initial stages of scoping this opportunity, and we expect to share detail on our progress at our 2023 Financial Community Meeting. In the meantime, I want to join Brian and wishing all of you a happy holiday season, and I want to pause and thank the entire Target team for making Target a great place to work and a store that's ready to bring joy to millions of our guests throughout this season and beyond. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Sure, Chris. This is Michael. I can take that one. We did see deceleration in the 3-year CAGR in the back part of October as well, and so we're factoring that into our extrapolated trends going forward. And you've heard me say, I think, other times on this call, Q4 is always its own animal, and so extrapolating trends into Q4 is tricky business in a normal year. But we think it's important to focus on the consumer changes that we saw in October and plan the business prudently and cautiously against those trends. It gives us the best position to be able to meet the consumer where we're at and continue to drive that unit share performance that we were pleased to see in the third quarter. Yes, Chris, I'll take that one, too. We're definitely not operating at a profit level we expect to over time. And the onetime impacts we've seen this year from the volatility and the change in trend has led us to more markdowns salvage action on inventory than we've seen historically by a wide margin. And so we would expect to get a lot of that margin and that improved markdown performance back. And so that's the factor I'd start with first. \n And the second thing I'd call out is what you heard us describe in terms of the efficiency opportunities we have in the business. To your exact point, we've generated incredible scale quickly. That opens up a lot of opportunities for us to rethink process technology and create efficiencies throughout the business by taking that scale that came on us quickly, stepping back and optimizing the business against that scale. So we're excited about the efficiencies that should come with the growth that we've seen over time. Yes. It's a fair question, Simeon. And sometimes it involves CapEx, and we're happy to invest that CapEx when the return is there. And so if we can put capital into the business that can drive efficiency for the team, I think you've seen us do that with technology in stores and supply chain, so that's a path we've been on, and we certainly aren't shy about making that investment when the return is there. But it won't all require capital. There's a lot of process reengineering and optimization that we can do that shouldn't have a capital price tag associated with it. \n And again, back to the examples John and Christina provided, so much of that is about the scale we've gained. There's a path of simplifying and taking costs out of the business when you don't have growth. We've got the fortunate position to be looking at the business on the heels of just exceptional growth and that creates a lot of opportunity for us to rebuild process against the business that's substantially bigger than it was a few years ago. I will answer that with where you ended your question, Kate, and that is we are committed to being clean at the end of the holiday season. And you're also right in the first half of your question. We accomplished what we wanted to in the first half of the year. We feel good about that work. And you heard me quote some versus 2019 benchmarks. If you were to just look versus last year, you'll see that Q2, out inventory was up 36% year-on-year; in Q3, it's about 14%. And so we made good progress on the plans we had in place. Obviously, we're looking at the change in the trends closely. If that trend we see persists, it will come with more markdowns to make sure we accomplish exactly that goal of ending the season clean."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Target Corporation's second quarter earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 17, 2022.  \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. \n On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Brian Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our second quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.  \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.  \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his perspective on the back half of the year. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Back in June, we announced that our team would be undertaking a bold effort to rightsize our inventory position in the categories through which demand patterns have rapidly changed.  \n While this decision had a meaningful short-term impact on our financial results, we strongly believe it was the best path forward. Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly, over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact, it would have held back our business over time. Of course, this decision would have driven incremental costs to store and manage the excess inventory over a longer period. But much more importantly, it would have degraded the guest experience. It would have cluttered our sales force and hampered our ability to present new, fresh and fashionable items, the ones our guests expect from Target.  \n Just as importantly, the extra inventory would have presented an ongoing burden to our supply chain and store teams, as they face the distraction of working around it day after day. Instead of taking that passive position, our team chose a more decisive path, aggressively reducing the inventory we already owned and cutting back on receipts for the back half of the year. And today, with those decisions behind us, we're in a much better position as we head into the fall season.  \n As you'll hear in more detail, we've meaningfully reduced our ownership and commitments in categories where we've seen softening demand. This has allowed us to strengthen our inventory position and in-stock position in the categories that are driving our growth, most notably in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials.  \n Regarding the financial impact of those decisions, Michael will provide more details in a few minutes. But the high-level story is, the vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us. This positions our business to deliver a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season. However, beyond financial and operational outcomes, I'm focused on how our inventory actions will benefit our guests and our team. Regarding our guests, we're now positioned to continue driving engagement and growing traffic with a clean, safe and uncluttered store experience and an assortment that highlights newness and supports growth. For our team, this quarter's inventory actions will enable them to focus on doing what they do best: providing a great guest experience while reducing the strengths and distraction from overly crowded store backrooms and distribution facilities.  \n After we announced the rightsizing effort at the beginning of June, I have heard from countless leaders across the company, who wanted to relay their gratitude for the decision to move quickly and face the issue head-on.  \n In the same spirit, I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of the entire Target team during a very challenging time for the economy, for our industry and our business. Our success in reducing inventory was a result of unprecedented effort, coordination and collaboration across multiple teams, from our U.S. headquarters to our Target India headquarters, to our stores, distribution centers, transportation team and sourcing offices around the world. And today, in the face of a very challenging backdrop, I'm proud of how our team and business model continue to serve our guests' evolving needs. Everything we do, from the design of our operating model to the way we train our team, is done with a focus on better serving our guests.  \n It's reflected in how we choose our assortment, where we curate a broad range of items, both in-store and online, from the stylish to the functional, incorporating quality and value throughout. It's also evident in how we design our store and the digital shopping experience that make them easy, convenient and inspirational, inviting guests to choose the right option every time they shop.  All of these decisions make our business model more durable, allowing us to drive deeper guest engagement and grow traffic in every environment.  \n Consistent with the shopping trends we've seen for more than a year, our second quarter comp increase of 2.6% was driven entirely by traffic, which expanded 2.7% this year, on top of double-digit growth a year ago. With this increase, second quarter traffic has expanded by well over 20% since 2019. In raw numbers, that means in the second quarter alone, we've added more than 90 million guest visits over the last 3 years.  \n These visits are a vivid demonstration of a deepening level of guest engagement resulting from multiple investments throughout our business. These investments include dozens of new stores and hundreds of remodels every year. They also include investments in our industry-leading same-day services, which have transformed our business in a short time. More specifically, 3 years ago, in the second quarter of 2019, digital fulfillment accounted for just over 7% of total sales. In contrast, by the second quarter of this year, the same-day portion of our digital sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. This drove our total digital penetration up to almost 18%, more than doubling in only 3 years.  \n Beyond our stores and fulfillment services, guests continue to respond to our investments in our own brand portfolio. This portfolio delivers more than $30 billion in annual sales, and includes 12 brands that generate more than $1 billion each. At the same time, we're investing in new spaces and presentation for key national brand partners like Apple, Disney and Levi's. And of course, we've been rapidly expanding the number of stores that feature an Ulta Beauty at Target given the incremental traffic and sales they deliver. But nothing has been more important than the investments we made in our team. These investments include the move to a starting hourly wage range of $15 to $24 across the country, enhanced health care and wellness benefits for a larger percentage of our team, the rollout of an industry-leading debt-free college educational plan and our work to enhance the growth and development opportunities available to all of our team members, and the team members of color in particular.  \n As we look ahead to the back half of the year, the team is laser-focused on delivering convenience, value and joy at a time when our guests are facing multiple challenges. And while we've taken a cautious stance on our inventory commitments, we'll continue to lean into frequency categories where guest demand has been strong and where the markdown risks are very low.  \n In addition, given the ongoing pressure our guests are facing from inflation, we're leaning into value. This means we're focused on providing great everyday pricing and strong opening price points across every category, including in our own brands. At the same time, we hear from our guests that they're focused on celebrating the seasonal moments they missed over the last 2 years. As a result, we'll lean into those seasonal moments, helping our guests find ways to come together and celebrate with family and friends.  \n So we still have a lot of business ahead of us. We've seen an encouraging start to the back-to-school and back-to-college season, and our teams are already deep into their planning for the upcoming Halloween season, a time when we expect our guests will fully embrace trick-or-treating and scheduling parties to celebrate with family, friends and neighbors.  \n Given continued volatility in the external environment, we built our fall plans with a priority on flexibility and agility, and that's where our business model shines. More specifically, our multi-category portfolio stays relevant and drive strips across a wide range of wants and needs.  \n In today's environment, that means our Food & Beverage category is front and center, having grown more than 50%, or $1.8 billion since the second quarter of 2019. But regardless of whether a Target Run begins with a need for an item in food and beverage or household essentials, to see what's new in our beauty assortment, the pick of a toy for a birthday party or a piece of luggage for an upcoming trip, our safe one-stop shopping experience provides an opportunity to sell items in every one of our categories on every guest visit.  \n Beyond our assortment, our unique stores-as-hubs operating model offers unmatched flexibility in how we can fulfill guest demand. Whether a guest wants to make a conventional in-store shopping trip, place a drive-up order, arrange a Shipt delivery or simply have a box delivered to their front door, stores can fulfill every one of those needs quickly and reliably, allowing our guests to choose what works best for them in that moment.  \n And as Michael will outline in more detail, our strong balance sheet and robust cash generation support continued investments during tough times like these, investments in our long-term growth and market share.  \n At a time when many others will be struggling just to survive, the ability to play offense and focus on the long term makes us well positioned to emerge from the current downturn even stronger than before.  \n So as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank our team for their continued passion for serving our guests and each other. While the environment remains challenging, I'm inspired by the new and unique merchandise, seasonal offerings and partnerships our team has planned for the back half of the year. And as I've traveled across the country to visit our stores and distribution centers, I've been inspired to hear how our team is energized and eager to serve our guests with energy, empathy and care, bringing some daily joy at a time when our guests are dealing with multiple headwinds. This unshakable guest focus is one of the many reasons our unique team makes Target a great company, and I am privileged and grateful to serve with them.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the tough environment we are facing today, I continue to be pleased with both our top line performance and the underlying market share we're seeing across our business: namely, across all 5 of our core merchandising categories. We saw unit share gains in the second quarter, providing clear evidence that our guests are finding more and more ways to satisfy their wants and needs with every Target Run.  \n As Brian mentioned earlier, the inventory actions we announced in June involved incredible collaboration across teams at headquarters, stores and throughout our supply chain network. And I'm proud to say that together as one team, we accomplished what we set out to do. By moving through excess units, we were able to realign our broader inventory portfolio to those categories our guests are most focused on, including frequency categories like Food & Beverage, Everyday Essentials and Beauty as well as all things new, seasonal and fashion-forward.  \n To accomplish that goal, teams analyzed and built action plans to aggressively work through excess inventory at every point along the product journey, from vendor to guests. This included rigorously reforecasting expectations for the balance of the year and beyond and determining where to reduce future receipts and orders. In some cases, they meant working with vendor partners to reduce our fall receipts in light of our updated expectations. It also meant quickly building compelling promotional plans to drive unit velocity for product we already owned, all with a focus on providing great value and generating excitement for our guests. And throughout the execution of these action plans, our teams remain steadfast in their guests-first focus, refusing to compromise the shopping experience in our stores or online.  \n As you heard from Brian, the short-term profit implications of these decisions were meaningful, but we're confident they're the right long-term decisions for our business, for our teams and for our guests.  As we formed and revisited our plans for the third quarter and beyond, we spent a lot of time listening to the wants, needs, hopes and concerns of our guests. What we're seeing in our results and hearing from our guests is that they still have spending power, but they're increasingly feeling the impact of inflation. And while the recent reduction in prices at the gas pump has been encouraging, guest confidence in their personal finances continues to wane.  \n Against that backdrop, we've seen our guests shop our owned brands in bigger ways and more frequently, knowing they are choosing great quality products with incredible value. We've also seen guest behavior evolve as they focus on optimizing their personal budgets through a heightened response to promotions as well as greater trip consolidation.  \n At the same time, guests continue to experience difficult news headlines, COVID surges and continued political volatility, leading them to seek more ways to celebrate, connect and find opportunities to bring joy to their families. This is one of the reasons we continue to see such strength in our seasonal categories, which we expect will continue in the back half of the year.  \n Now let me turn to some of the category highlights from the second quarter, in which overall comparable sales grew 2.6%, on top of 8.9% a year ago, reflecting continued strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials.  \n Food & Beverage led the way in the quarter with growth in the low double digits, reflecting broad strength across multiple subcategories. Beauty grew in the high single digits, reflecting notable strength in Ulta Beauty at Target, along with the skincare and bath categories. Essentials grew in the mid-single digits with performance led by pets and health care. Overall, across our discretionary categories, sales were softer than a year ago, but remained nearly $3.5 billion or more than 35% higher than the second quarter of 2019.  \n In Hardlines, overall comp sales were down slightly to last year. Within Hardlines, softness in electronics was partially offset by strength in entertainment, which grew in the high single digits, along with high single-digit comp growth in toys, an encouraging sign as we plan for the fourth quarter holiday season.  \n Overall, the Home category saw a low single-digit decline compared to last year despite affinity for our seasonal assortments and encouraging early results in back-to-school and back-to-college.  \n Apparel also saw a low single-digit decline in the second quarter but saw meaningful growth in women's fashion-forward categories, along with performance apparel, on top of strong sales growth in the category over the past 2 years.  \n As I mentioned earlier, while overall sales growth is one key indicator of the health of our business, market share is an equally important measure that we use to understand how we're performing. And notably, during inflationary times like these, we heavily focus on unit share, specifically to better understand our relevance as compared to our competitive set, given that growth in both traffic and units is a strong proxy for the guests' overall engagement with Target. Time and time again, these metrics have proven to be a better barometer for lasting success as compared to growth solely through average retail prices. That's why I'm so encouraged that across all 5 of our core merchandising categories, we grew unit share in the second quarter.  \n So now let's turn our sights to all that is to come for the balance of the fiscal year. Having celebrated holidays in a big way in the second quarter, guests already have their sights set on upcoming holidays and seasonal moments in Q3 and beyond. Preparing for the upcoming school year is top of mind for families right now. And to help with the transition, we're providing budget-friendly options for students, parents and teachers alike. Beyond our assortment of value-priced owned brands and leading national brands, we're offering a onetime 20% off Target Circle deal for college students to get those dorm rooms prepped and ready. And we've also extended our teacher prep event to nearly 8 weeks of discounts on supplies and more.  \n And today, while we still have several weeks of the season left to go, we've been encouraged by early results in both our back-to-school and back-to-college programs. Shortly after school begins, we'll turn our attention to celebrating Latino Heritage Month, which begins in the middle of September. We're excited to help celebrate this important cultural moment with our guests through the presentation of a compelling assortment, 99% of which was created by members of the Hispanic/Latino community. Then before we know it, Halloween celebrations will be underway, with all the tricks and treats the season has to offer. Our guest research indicates that more families plan to participate in Halloween festivities compared with last year, and we're ready with a wide array of gender and size inclusive costumes, new owned brand trick-or-treating candy and accessories, haunted house cookie building sets and so much more.  \n And for those that want to celebrate the broader fall and harvest season in general, rest assured that there will be no shortage of new offerings from Good & Gather to create perfect meal, snacking and entertaining solutions, including delicious new flavors of the season like maple, cinnamon, apple and, of course, all things pumpkin spice.  \n Outside of specific holidays, we are focused on helping our guests experience Everyday Joy, and our ability to cut across brands and categories is part of what makes us uniquely Target. For an example, look no further than our upcoming collaboration this fall with Marvel to bring a unique assortment to our guests across the Avengers and Spider-Man franchises. One standout will be lots of Marvel Studios' Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Black Panther Legacy exclusives within toys, Apparel, Home and more. We'll have more details to share in the coming months.  \n And in an exciting collaboration with long-time partner, The LEGO Group, we are bringing their popular LEGO Ideas contest to Target, in which LEGO superfans submit ideas for a themed LEGO building set. After a public submission phase, a handful of finalists will be selected for guests and fans to choose their favorite idea to be produced as an exclusive set at Target and LEGO brand retail stores. \n But Target Joy goes well beyond key holidays or exclusive launches. It's about how we continue to iterate and improve upon what our guests already know and love from their regular Target Run. This next quarter, you'll see us elevate our fashion assortment with several new collections and updated brands. We'll introduce new well-known national brands in cookware and kitchen. We'll also continue to expand our leading national brand partnerships, including opening more Disney stores and, of course, Ulta Beauty at Target. \n In fact, we're only a year into this new partnership, and there's plenty of room to grow ahead. With the introduction of new designer fragrance brands, including Coach, Clinique, Kate Spade and more as well as additional skin and hair care products, we continue to evolve the assortment to bring more joy to our Beauty guests. We remain on track to open at least 250 of these unique spaces this year. Plus, we've already seen more than 1.5 million guests link their Target Circle and Ultamate Rewards accounts, a number that's sure to continue to grow in the months and years ahead.  \n So now before I pass things over to John, I'd like to take a moment and echo Brian's gratitude for the team. While we have demonstrated time and time again that our durable, flexible model can quickly pivot with changing consumer demands and a host of retail and economic conditions, none of that can happen without an incredible team. Their talent, dedication, passion and expertise allows us to continue putting the Target guests at the center of every decision we make. As a result, we continue to benefit from deeper guest loyalty and preference for our brand. \n I have been at Target 19 years, and I continue to be inspired every day by the talent around me. Thank you for your commitment and care to all our stakeholders.  \n With that, I'll pass things over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. In past calls, I've described how our operations team is always focused on two things at the same time. Of course, they're always focused on short-term execution and problem-solving to ensure we provide a convenient, consistent and inspiring experience for our guests. In addition, our team works every day to deliver on our long-term vision and aspirations, ensuring our operations are ready to support our future plans. While this dual focus on both near-term and long-term priorities has always been present, it's been especially notable this year, given that we've been operating in a very unique environment. \n In terms of the short term, and as Brian and Christina mentioned earlier, our work to quickly rightsize inventory require determination, commitment and coordination between multiple teams across the company. And given the need to protect the guest experience, there was no higher priority than delivering against this near-term plan. At the same time, our team remains passionately focused on the long-term investments we're making in our future. These investments include our work to modernize and expand our store footprint, increase upstream capacity in our supply chain, automate distribution center processes to reduce store workload and enhance our last-mile fulfillment capabilities by opening sortation centers and integrating them into our Shipt network.  And fortunately, as Brian highlighted, the strength of our business allows us to continue funding these long-term investments even in the face of the challenging external backdrop we're facing today.  \n I want to first turn to our work on inventory. And I'm happy to report that our team has made remarkable progress over the last few months, causing conditions in our supply chain to improve significantly. More specifically, and to provide some helpful context, over time, we want to keep our DC network operating at or below 85% of its maximum capacity, given that operational difficulties and costs rise significantly when we move beyond that level. So it's important to note that back in June, inventory in our DC network peaked at well over 90% of our capacity. Also notable, by the end of the second quarter, less than 2 months later, our team had quickly reduced DC capacity utilization to below 80%.  \n Put another way, by the end of the second quarter, the physical space occupied by our distribution center inventory was more than 20% lower than the peak we reached in June. So today, while we still have some individual sites where we need to make more progress, the team has accomplished a remarkable improvement in a very short time, which will allow our end-to-end operations to function more efficiently and effectively in the back half of the year.  \n As Christina mentioned, beyond addressing the inventory we already owned, the team also took a hard look at sales trends and determined ideal inventory levels across every category for the remainder of the year. As a result, we've meaningfully reduced our fall season receipt commitments in many discretionary categories. With these reductions, we're projecting our DCs will remain at or below 85% capacity through the remainder of the year, even after the seasonal increase in holiday inventory that is set to occur over the next 2 months.  In other words, for the first time I am aware of, our fall season inventory is projected to peak at a lower level than in spring, providing another vivid illustration of the unique dynamics we've encountered so far this year.  \n While this inventory rightsizing process hasn't been easy and our teams have devoted an amazing amount of effort in a small amount of time, this work has allowed our teams to strengthen ongoing communication mechanisms and build new processes. Going forward, these improvements will enable our merchandising and supply chain teams to maintain enhanced real-time communication, particularly with respect to categories where we face the highest inventory risk, allowing us to respond to changes with more speed and agility.  \n While pressure from excess inventory has presented the biggest challenge to our team this year, dealing with high costs and volatility in the external supply chain has run a close second. And today, while conditions remain far from what we would have considered normal in the years before the pandemic, there are early signs that both costs and volatility may have peaked. More specifically, lead times in global shipping have begun to decline. Spot rates to move shipping containers have fallen somewhat. And in light of the reduction in petroleum prices we've all seen recently, fuel surcharges have been easing somewhat compared with the peak rates we saw earlier in the second quarter.  \n That said, conditions remain highly unfavorable when compared to the years before the pandemic, and we're mindful of the continued risks in the months ahead, including potential slowdowns at the West Coast ports, a reversal of the recent decline in energy costs and the possibility of additional COVID lockdowns in China.  \n In addition, we continue to encounter far too many delays affecting overseas shipping which require us to pay spot rates to move containers, rates that are well above our prenegotiated shipping rates. As such, we're maintaining our practice of moving receipt dates earlier than we would have in the past, which allows us to mitigate the business risk from receiving shipments later than expected.  \n You'll recall that at this time a year ago, when the external supply chain began slowing down and shipments were arriving late, we began relying on air freight much more than usual to ensure we receive key seasonal merchandise on time for the holiday season. While that was the right decision at the time given the circumstances we were facing, this year, we expect to meaningfully reduce our reliance on air freight by moving to early receipt dates for seasonal inventory. To accommodate these early receipts without adding further color to our supply chain in stores, we secured temporary capacity to store and stage shipping containers near the ports where we receive them. When needed, this allows us to quickly clear the containers from the port area and hold them until the ideal time to begin moving inventory into our supply chain network.  While we don't expect to need this additional capacity over the long term, we believe it's clearly the most efficient approach in today's environment, given the volatility we continue to face.  \n I also want to highlight the critical role that our stores have played in our work to improve conditions in our supply chain. During the second quarter, our store teams engaged in a host of activities to support the effort, including the execution of countless promotions and markdown programs to move the excess merchandise quickly and the development of innovative presentation strategies to highlight the deals we were offering our guests. This included repurposing the seasonal presentation space in our stores to highlight deals and create meaningful statements, including key item promotions. It also included the early wind down of our outdoor living assortment, which allowed us to bring in our back-to-school set earlier than usual, ensuring we are back in stock and reliable on key items parents needed to fill their back-to-school shopping list.  \n More specifically, at the end of the second quarter, about 3/4 of our back-to-school and back-to-college receipts were already downstream in our stores, a number that was closer to 50% at the end of Q2 a year ago.  \n So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to turn my focus to our longer-term priorities and the multiple ways we're investing in our future growth. As you know, the majority of our CapEx is going into our store network, both to extend our footprint and invest in existing locations. These store investments fall into 3 major buckets. The first and largest investment is in our store remodel program, where we completely transform the space in an existing location, modernizing the shopping experience while enhancing the productivity of our team. At this point in the year, well over 100 remodels are currently in flight across the country, keeping us on track to complete nearly 200 remodels this year.  \n In addition to these complete transformations, we're also making smaller investments in hundreds of other locations. This includes the hundreds of fulfillment remodels we'll accomplish this year, in which we reconfigure portions of the store to enhance the efficiency, safety and capacity of our drive-up, in-store pickup and ship-from-store services. In addition, this year, we're investing in several hundred locations to add an Ulta Beauty at Target, a co-branded Apple shopping space or a Disney store presentation to the sales floor. And finally, we're on track to add about 24 new store locations in 2022. So far this year, we've opened 12 new locations across the country, in neighborhoods as diverse as SoHo in New York and Jackson Hole in Wyoming.  \n Beyond this work in stores, we're also making significant investments in our supply chain focused on 3 main priorities. The first is to build additional upstream capacity to our network, given that we continue to grow sales on top of the $27 billion we added in 2020 and 2021.  In support of this goal, we opened 2 upstream DCs near the end of 2021 and plan to open 6 new upstream facilities over the next several years, including 2 on track to open in 2023. \n In addition to the space we're adding to the network, we're continuing to modernize how our existing distribution centers serve our stores by developing and automating processes that reduce the amount of store workload devoted to receiving inventory and restocking store sales floors. And finally, we're rapidly expanding the number of sortation centers operating around the country. We have 6 of these facilities operating today, including 3 that have opened in the last few months, and we have plans to add 5 more by early next year. These small facilities expand ship-from-store capacity in the locations they serve while significantly reducing last-mile delivery costs, particularly as we integrate our Shipt drivers into the process.  \n Given the package delivery density we've achieved across many markets over the last few years, we see continued opportunities to add more sortation centers over the next few years, which adds speed and significantly reduce last-mile costs in markets where they operate.  \n As I mentioned last quarter, this year's capital projects are being impacted by the cost increases, material shortages and supply chain pressures that are affecting other parts of our business. And I'm really proud of how our construction team is managing through these headwinds. More specifically, while cost increases are raising the cost of many of these projects, the team has done an excellent job in keeping the vast majority of projects on track and on time despite the significant headwinds they are facing. \n So as I conclude my remarks, I have to pause and add my thanks to the entire team for their resilience and perseverance during a period of incredibly rapid change, which caused this quarter to be as challenging as any I've seen in my career. In the face of that challenge, what's been amazing is how our team members have stayed positive, how they've worked to find collaborative solutions across multiple teams and never strayed from their commitment to our guests and our company purpose. With the progress they have made, our operations are now in much better shape, and the team is energized and ready to play offense in the back half of the year.  \n While we are all mindful of the near-term volatility in the environment, it's times like these that often present the biggest opportunity to gain long-term market share as others face the distraction of trying to stay afloat while we continue to invest and improve our operations. That's one of many reasons that I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in the years ahead.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. As John mentioned, we often ask our team to be mindful of both short-term and long-term considerations when making decisions. And given the unique circumstances we've been facing, this quarter, we faced a decision with meaningful implications for both. As Brian outlined earlier, if we had decided not to deal with our excess inventory head-on, we could have avoided some short-term pain on the profit line, but that would have hampered our longer-term potential. Instead, because of the path we took, our quarterly profit took a meaningful step-down, but our future path is brighter. Our operations are healthy, our store and DC teams have more flexibility to maneuver and we're ready to feature both the fresh assortment and uncluttered shopping experience our guests expect and deserve. That passionate commitment to the guest experience is one of the many reasons we've now seen 21 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth. \n While normally our income statement gets the most attention, I want to start my remarks today with the balance sheet and specifically, our inventory position. And as I dig into the detail, I want to acknowledge upfront that this kind of analysis is a relatively complex exercise because of the growth and volatility we've experienced over the last couple of years, because of the broad and diverse assortment that we sell and the fact that our business is seasonal from quarter-to-quarter. \n More specifically, given that our inventory position throughout the pandemic was far from optimal, focusing on year-over-year growth numbers isn't very helpful right now. As a result, we often base our inventory analysis on growth trends compared with 2019, a pre-pandemic year when our inventory and sales trends were much more in sync.\n With that as context, I want to zero in on one of the questions I'm sure you have, which is why our inventory on the balance sheet remained roughly constant at around $15 billion between the first and second quarters. The simple answer is that while that single number didn't change much, we accomplished exactly what we intended to do during the quarter, which helped change conditions significantly below the surface. \n More specifically, because of the inventory actions we executed, unit growth compared with 2019 in our discretionary categories decelerated by more than 15 percentage points between the first and second quarter, a change we estimate would have reduced our inventory position by more than $1 billion if taken in isolation. \n However, a couple of offsetting changes moved our quarter-end inventory in the other direction. First among them, we leaned into our frequency categories during the quarter, accelerating 3-year unit growth versus Q1 at a double-digit rate, resulting in stronger in-stock metrics compared with 90 days ago. Another factor that drove inventory dollars higher is the continued increase in unit costs we've been seeing across all of our categories, which caused the dollar value of our inventory to grow faster than unit growth in the second quarter.\n So where do we stand today? At the end of the second quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was about $6 billion higher than we reported 3 years ago. Of that dollar growth, about $3 billion or approximately half of that total growth is the result of higher unit costs across our assortment. Of the remaining $3 billion, our analysis indicates another $1 billion to $2 billion is related to our decision to move receipt timing earlier, given the volatility we continue to expect in the supply chain. And also importantly, beyond reshaping the inventory we already have, our Q2 inventory actions also included the removal of more than $1.5 billion of fall receipts in our discretionary categories, reflecting our continued focus on reducing risk in the current environment. That's why we feel good about our inventory position as we head into the back half of the year. \n So now I'll turn to a review of our second quarter financial results. Total sales increased 3.3% in the quarter, driven by a 2.6% increase in comparable sales, combined with the impact of new stores. Total revenue increased 3.5%, reflecting sales growth along with the benefit of nearly 15% growth on the other revenue line, driven by continued strength in our Roundel ad business. \n Just as Christina pointed out, that unit share is a key measure of Target's relevance versus competitors, traffic growth is another important indicator of the relevance of our brand. Our continued traffic growth in the second quarter clearly demonstrates the ability of our balanced multi-category assortment to deliver continued relevance in a rapidly changing environment like we're seeing today. So that even as our guests' preference for individual categories has been changing dramatically so far this year, that hasn't affected their preference for Target. As a result, traffic accounted for 100% of our comparable sales growth in the second quarter, increasing 2.7%, on top of 12.7% a year ago. Average ticket remained essentially flat in the quarter, as low single-digit increase in average retail was offset by a similar reduction in the number of items per transaction. \n Across our sales channels, store comps grew 1.3%, on top of 8.7% a year ago, while digital comps grew 9%, on top of 9.9% last year. Digital growth continues to be led by our same-day services, which saw double-digit growth overall and mid-teens growth in drive-up. \n On the gross margin line, we saw a nearly 9 percentage point decline compared with last year. Merchandising accounted for more than 7 points of this pressure, driven primarily by our inventory reduction efforts, along with the impact of higher fuel and transportation costs, product cost increases and higher shrink, partially offset by the benefit of retail price increases. \n In addition, digital fulfillment and supply chain drove about 1.5 points of pressure, reflecting increased compensation and headcount in our distribution centers, combined with the cost of managing excess inventory and higher last-mile shipping costs. Consistent with the first quarter, mix accounted for approximately 10 basis points of pressure. The softness in higher-margin categories like Apparel and Home was largely offset by softness in lower-margin discretionary categories, most notably electronics. \n On the SG&A line, we continue to benefit from fixed cost leverage and efficiency gains across our operations, which helped to offset the impact of cost inflation across multiple expense lines. Within overall compensation, lower incentive compensation more than offset continued investments in pay and benefits for our hourly team members. \n Altogether, our second quarter operating margin rate was 1.2%, down from an unusually high 9.8% a year ago, driven entirely by the decline in our gross margin rate. This operating margin performance was below the midpoint of our most recent guidance, as the cost of our inventory actions was somewhat higher than expected. \n While an operating margin rate of just over 1% is well below anything I've seen in my career and something I never expect to see again, I have no doubt that it was the right outcome given the unusual circumstances we've been facing this year. Our focus throughout the second quarter was to ensure that we took care of the excess inventory of our network and adjust future receipts to reflect the rapid change in sales trends we've seen so far this year. We accomplished this goal to the benefit of our operations, our team and our guests. \n Finally, one note on our tax rate. In a period like this year, when our operating profit is unusually low, tax benefits have a larger-than-normal impact on our tax rate, which helps to explain why our year-to-date tax rate has been lower than expected. Looking forward, given that we anticipate a meaningful improvement in our operating performance in the back half of the year, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate will be in a range around 21%.\n Now I'm going to turn to capital deployment and begin where I always do by articulating our priorities, which we've supported consistently for decades. Our first priority is always to invest fully in our business, in projects that support our strategic and financial criteria. Once we've met this first priority, we support our dividend and look to extend our 50-year record of annual increases. And finally, once we've supported the first 2 priorities, we return any remaining excess cash by repurchasing our shares over time, within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Regarding the first priority, second quarter CapEx was approximately $1.5 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to just over $2.5 billion. As you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, we guided to an expected full year CapEx range of $4 billion to $5 billion. And at the time, I indicated my hope that we'd reach the high end of that range, with the outcome depending on how many capital projects could stay on schedule. \n So I'm happy that, as John mentioned, the team is doing a great job of keeping projects on track despite facing multiple headwinds, all while inflation in the cost of equipment, materials and labor is driving project spending above initial projections. As such, we now expect our full year CapEx will be $5 billion or more for the year, reflecting both the number of projects that remain on track and the expected impact of cost inflation.\n Of course, while we prefer not to face the cost pressure on these projects, I'm encouraged that so many value-creating projects remain on track to be completed this year, projects that will benefit our operations and our P&L for years to come. \n Turning to our second capital deployment priority. We returned $417 million in dividends to our shareholders in the second quarter, up from $336 million a year ago, driven by a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in average share count. \n And finally, in June, we reached the final settlement for the accelerated share repurchase agreement we initiated last March. Under this ASR, we invested $2.6 billion to retire 12.5 million shares of our stock. Looking forward, just as our inventory commitments reflect continued caution for the remainder of the year, we're taking a similar cautious stance in terms of our share repurchase activity. And of course, any repurchase activity will be consistent with our long-term goal to maintain our middle A credit ratings. \n So now I want to close my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures both our near-term profitability and the efficiency of our CapEx decisions over time. In the second quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 18.4% compared with 31.7% a year ago. And it's notable, while the current number is well below where we expect to operate over time, an after-tax number in the high teens would have been considered aspirational for our business only a few years ago. So for us to temporarily move down to this level in an environment as challenging as we're facing is a vivid confirmation of the underlying strength and resilience of our business model, and the reason we continue to be incredibly optimistic about our future prospects. \n And that confidence starts and ends with our team, so I want to pause and express my gratitude to the best team in retail. Without your efforts, we couldn't have achieved the remarkable growth in traffic and sales that we've seen over the last few years and why even in a tough year, our business remains strong. \n Now let's turn to our guidance. And based on the hard work of our team in the second quarter, we feel really good about how we're positioned going into the back half of the year. At the same time, given that we've been experiencing volatile economic conditions so far this year and that volatility appears likely to continue in the months ahead, we're maintaining a cautious stance as we plan our business given the potential macro and consumer risks that might emerge. That's why, as you've heard throughout our remarks today, our second quarter inventory actions were specifically designed to reduce our level of risk in discretionary categories. And in terms of our operations, the team has focused on building flexibility into our plans, placing a premium on staying nimble and adjusting quickly in the face of any potential change in macro trends. \n Regarding the top line, our expectations have remained consistent so far this year, with guidance for full year total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. With the front half of the year behind us, both our Q1 and Q2 results have put us squarely in the middle of that range. And today, based on our current performance and plans for the back half of the year, we remain positioned to deliver full year revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. \n On the operating margin line, our most recent guidance anticipated a fall season operating margin rate and a range centered around 6%. This expectation is nearly double our spring result. And notably, if we hit that rate in the fall, it would exceed the fall season rates we were delivering prior to the pandemic. And today, similar to my commentary on the top line, based on the success of our Q2 inventory actions and our current performance, we remain positioned to deliver an operating margin rate in a range around 6% in the fall season. \n Between the last 2 quarters of the year, we expect our third quarter rate will be well below our Q3 performance over the last couple of years, while our fourth quarter rate should be much more in line with our recent Q4 experience. Most notably, in the third quarter, we'll continue to experience some spillover impact from our inventory actions in the range of $200 million. In contrast, in Q4, we'll be annualizing meaningful cost headwinds that surfaced a year ago, which will make the year-over-year comparison more favorable despite the current headwinds we're facing. \n All that said, while we typically anticipate something closer to a balance of upside and downside potential when we make any forecast, the macro and consumer risks in the back half of this year feel skewed to the downside. That's why even in the face of consistent business trends in recent months, we've undertaken the significant cost and effort to remove risk from our inventory commitments. It's why we're stubbornly focused on real-time monitoring and communication of evolving conditions, and why we've asked our team to build flexibility and agility into their plans. With that mindset, if trends move away from what we're seeing today, we're ready to quickly adjust. \n So now before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to emphasize why we're so confident in our long-term potential, even as we navigate a very challenging environment in a year of multiple challenges, including rapidly changing consumer preferences, inflation at 40-year highs, volatile supply chain conditions and rising fuel and transportation rates that are expected to add well over $1 billion of cost this year. Our business continues to generate historically strong traffic increases, low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and unit share gains across all of our core merchandising categories. \n And even in the face of unprecedented profit rate pressure driven by the host of factors I just listed, we remain profitable with an after-tax ROIC in the mid-teens. In fact, if our performance in the fall is consistent with the revenue growth and operating margin rates I outlined earlier, we remain positioned in 2022 to generate higher operating margin dollars than we did in 2019. That's what we mean when we say we have built a durable model. \n And today, while we expect conditions to remain challenging in the near term, the operating margin rate improvement we're projecting in the back half of the year should serve as an early indicator of the continued rate improvement we should deliver in the years ahead. With the potential for additional rate expansion and continued growth in traffic and revenue in the years ahead, we're facing a compelling financial picture as the economy and consumer eventually recover.  That's why I've never been more confident in our long-term prospects than I am today. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. I often tell my team that leadership and performance are tightly linked over time, but that leadership often appears first. That's why I'm extremely proud of the leadership our team showed in the second quarter. After they took a hard look at our owned inventory position and the amount that was building up across our industry, they opted to make the hard choice: get in front of the problem and address it head-on. \n They made that decision with the full knowledge it would have a profound impact on our near-term profitability. They also knew there was another path. We could have avoided attacking the problem and avoid some of the pain in the short run. But instead, our team chose to lead. They knew the best path for our guests and for our teams in our stores and distribution centers was to take action and improve the condition of our inventory and operations quickly. That path would allow the entire Target team to move ahead without facing the ongoing burden of excess inventory holding us back. \n So the team quickly developed the [ bolder ] plan, which we announced in early June, just over 2 months ago. And in the intervening weeks, teams across the company worked tirelessly to take the plan and make it a reality. That's the reason we're positioned to deliver a strong improvement in our profitability this fall despite an environment that's far from ideal. Because of our team's leadership, our business today is much better positioned to perform, and I couldn't be more proud and grateful for the courage they have shown. \n So with that, I want to thank you for listening into our call today. And now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We're now ready with our first question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: You talked about an encouraging start to back-to-school. Can you talk about what you've seen in July and August? A lot of retailers like you have talked about improving trends. So what does that mean for how you're thinking about the back half comps? And does that reflect the current trend in the business, as you said in the guidance? Because I guess the question we have is, is the risk -- how did you incorporate the risk that the bounce in trend that you're seeing now is just that episodic event-type spending that you've been highlighting all year? \nBrian Cornell: Chris, thanks for joining us this morning. I'll let Christina talk about some of the back-to-school and back-to-college trends and Michael to build on guidance. But before we start, based on the length of our prepared comments, we are going to ask for some additional time for Q&A. So operator, we're going to extend the time for this call to make sure we cover as many questions as possible. \n Christina, do you want to start by talking about some of the back-to-school and back-to-college trends we're seeing? \nA. Hennington: Yes. As I shared earlier in my prepared remarks, we're optimistic about what back-to-school and back-to-college mean. This -- during seasonal times is when Target really shines, the reason being that our multi-category portfolio makes us even more relevant, the opportunity to buy kids uniform, backpacks, the school -- the lunch kit and everything that goes in it and, of course, all the supplies. And so they've always -- seasonal moments have always been a good proxy for the strength of the total portfolio. And so as we're seeing good early trends, albeit there's a lot of business left to be done, we believe that, that is a good indicator of the strength of the potential for the fall. The other thing to look at, of course, is how we have performed to date, and our traffic and unit share growth that we've seen across the portfolio holistically gives us confidence in the guest choice of Target as their retailer of preference. \nBrian Cornell: Chris, I'll let Michael talk about guidance. But one of the things that really stands out for me as I look at our position today, is that continued strength in traffic and the growth we're seeing in units across our entire portfolio. I'd also recognize, based on the actions we've taken with our inventory position, if you walk our stores today, it is clear that we are prepared for back-to-school and back-to-college, and we're really standing tall in those categories. \n Mike, do we want to talk about the guidance? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. And I'll build off the comment you just made, Brian. When we look at the quarter, Chris, a lot of the trends we see in Q2 are informing our view of the back half of the year. And I think Q2 is a pretty good proxy for some of those top line assumptions that we have in the back part of the year. The consistency of traffic for the year across the months of the quarter, I think that's the thing that we look at really closely that gives us a lot of evidence that even as shopping habits have changed and category trends have changed, we've seen a consistent draw to more and more shoppers shop in our stores and shopping us online. And that consistency of traffic is the thing that gives me lot of optimism as I look to the back half of the year even if we can't sit here today and predict every twist and turn. \nBrian Cornell: Chris, I'll add one final point. As we talk to our guests, when we talk to consumers, while there's certainly a cautionary environment in front of us, but one thing that seems to be very consistent is a guest and consumer who says they want to celebrate the holiday seasons. So we certainly expect that they are going to be celebrating Halloween this year and actively trick-or-treating and hosting parties with friends and family. We know they're looking forward to Thanksgiving, and they're going to look forward to celebrating the Christmas holidays. And that comes out each and every week as we survey consumers and talk to our guests. So that gives us great optimism for our ability to perform during these key holiday seasons. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And so my follow-up is just, Michael, you talked about the phasing of the operating margin. So the interpretation is that the fourth quarter is going to look a lot more consistent with what you did last year, maybe a little bit below. So the third quarter comes in well below that 6% -- around 6%. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. You -- as I said in my remarks, I expect to -- we sit here today, expecting a fourth quarter, it looks more like the fourth quarter we've seen in the last couple of years. And so I think that's a 6.8% last year and a 6.5% the year before that. That's the right range around which we set our expectations for the fourth quarter. And obviously, to get to a 6% in total, that implies a lower number in the third quarter. And the driver there is, like I talked about in remarks, some of the costs of our inventory actions do spill over into the third quarter. And we'll continue to manage the elevated fuel and freight costs and kind of how those net against pricing action and things like that over the balance of the year. But we feel good about that range, around 6%, and we'll continue to watch the macro environment really closely. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. \nEdward Yruma: Two from me. I guess first, on the variance relative to your previous expectations in terms of the inventory actions, were there specific areas where you had to cut deeper or cost more to get out of inventory positions? And then as a broader question, one of your peers talked about some changes they're seeing in their customer base. I guess are there any noteworthy changes that you're seeing? Are there customers trading down or trading into Target? \nBrian Cornell: And I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the inventory actions, but I really want to start by recognizing our team. I think as we sit here today, over the last few weeks since our announcement in June, this has been a collaborative effort, and the team has accomplished so much to put us in the right place as we get ready for the back half of the year. So based on the work that the teams have done across our supply chain system, in merchandising, in finance and supply chain, in stores, the team has accomplished more than we expected in a short period of time and put us in a better position from an inventory standpoint than we might have expected back in June. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. Ed, I'll just add on it. I think largely, we're on track with what we thought at the -- when we came out with the announcement earlier in Q2. A little bit of it cost us a little bit more in promos or clearance to move some inventory. But I think the work the team did in a very short amount of time to size what we needed to take care of is largely in line with where we are today, and we feel really good about where we're at. \n As Michael said, a little bit spilled over into Q3, and that's really just timing more than anything else. We just didn't get to it. But the work that's been done, we're really proud of. And I would say, from my position, we did exactly what we set out to do. We got rid of the inventory we needed to, the operations are in a much better place. There's a little bit more to do here in Q3 that will clean up. \n And I think the one thing I'd add on that I don't want to get lost is the amount of receipts that were cut from discretionary categories in Q3 and Q4, and that is just huge for us, again, because of the uncertainty in those particular categories. And if sales end up a little bit higher, we'll have a little bit higher sell-through, and that will be a great day. But that really derisks those categories going forward. So we feel great about the work that's been done over the past few months. \nA. Hennington: And Ed, maybe I can add a little bit to the question about the customer. As I shared in my prepared remarks, our guest is still demonstrating that they have spending power. The choices that they're making to balance their budget is what we're watching. And so obviously, we're moderating our investment in some of those discretionary businesses, and we're leaning very much into Food & Beverage, Essentials, Beauty, but also select portions of the portfolio and discretionary that have stayed resilient, whether it's toys, luggage, seasonal moments, fashion-forward apparel. And so it's really about reading the guests listening to them and continuing to support a level of agility in the business model. And in terms of other choices that they're making, I think traffic and unit share are the best barometer for their investment in Target. We're still growing traffic, and we're growing unit share in every major category, which to me says that our relevance is high with the guests right now and they're managing their budgets as best fit and they're finding options at Target. \nOperator: Our next question is from Steph Wissink with Jefferies. \nStephanie Schiller Wissink: Just wanted to ask a follow-up question on pricing for the back half. Just give us some sense of how you're thinking about promotionality. I think you've mentioned in your prepared remarks that consumers were responding to some of the promotions you were putting out. So just give us a sense of what you factored into the guidance in terms of heightened levels of promotions. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks for the question, Steph. I mean we always know as we get to the back half of the year, it's a promotional environment. The holidays always are, and so we factored that in accordingly. And we see a consumer in the current inflationary environment that's focused on value. And like we've said many times in these calls, we think about pricing first through the lens of our guests. We want to make sure the guests can find great value on shelf, online and the way that we're priced and we feel good about where we've struck that value equation. And I think the traffic we're seeing speaks to the fact that guests see it, too. \nBrian Cornell: And Steph, I'd only add that Christina and her team have done a wonderful job as we plan for the back half of the year, of ensuring that we have great value for our guests but also that we have exciting newness. And I think that combination is a winning formula for us as we think about the back half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: My first question is how much did the clearance and promotional activity contribute to the C-store sales growth in the first -- in the second quarter? And if you do see more downside than upside risk to the guidance for the back half of the year, why didn't you just moderate the guidance a little lower for the back half? \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure, Michael. Thanks for the question. While the kind of counterfactual with every elasticity of where Q2 would have landed, it is a little bit of more art than science. We think that the net dollar impact of our markdowns is probably negligible all in, in the second quarter. And of course, we took some markdowns to move through some product, but we think that probably net-net, that didn't move our top line comp a lot. \n As we think about the back half of the year, we're informing the back half based on the trends that we're seeing now in the business. And as we've talked about, some of those trends that we saw change at the end of Q1, we've seen persist into Q2, and we factored that in to our thinking for the back half of the year. We'll continue to be mindful of what's clearly in an uncertain environment for the economy and the consumer. And to the point Christina made earlier in Q&A, we'll stay close to those trends, and we'll adjust accordingly. And that's why taking the inventory actions we did to give us some room to operate and to give us some flexibility in the system will be important in an uncertain environment. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is there's obviously a lot of moving pieces with what's happening at Target right now. But isn't a lot of this just transitional and setting the set stage to grow better 2023 really somewhat independent of the macro environment? So with that being said, could you size the impact to your margins from all the inventory actions that you're taking this quarter, next quarter that are temporary and will be isolated to this year and won't repeat next year? Can you give us a better sense of what the ongoing profitability of the business is? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, I'll start by saying, I think your summary really captures the actions we've been taking today really to make sure that we continue to build on the traffic we're seeing in our stores and the visits to our site, the strength we're seeing in unit market share gains; but importantly, the investments we made to ensure we have a great guest experience in the back half of the year and going into 2023. So the bold, decisive actions were really to make sure we continue to build on our current momentum, the great relationship we have with our guests, the momentum we're building from a market share standpoint and providing our guests with a great Target experience every time they shop. That will continue and set us up well for 2023. \n As far as sizing it, we'll certainly come back to all of you as we think about guidance for next year, but we certainly expect to see a more normalized environment from an operating profit standpoint as we move into 2023 and continue to build on the momentum and the investments we've been making in our business for years. \nOperator: The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Following up on actually Michael's question, is there any way you can quantify some of the structurally higher costs in labor in the DC? Just as a way to back out, that might be the one driver that stays in gross margin. But then in theory, you should recapture most of what's happened this year. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I mean there's probably a piece in each bucket, Simeon. As we've grown the business, obviously, we invest more labor in moving the product to support that growth, and that's a piece of some of that growth there. And then it also costs us more when we're full. And our supply chain was full in the second quarter. And so there's a piece of that, that will result in improved productivity over time as we get some of that inventory out of the system. To Brian's point, we'll come back and unpack next year when the time is right to do that. But I expect to see both of those drivers present as we do so. \nSimeon Gutman: And maybe just a quick follow-up. You mentioned Q4 profitability should look more Target-esque. Does that mean -- like what's the assumption for mix in that fourth quarter relative to where we are today? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. We aren't breaking out a specific assumption for mix. But I think if you look over the last couple of quarters, you see mix isn't a big driver of our margin results. And so I wouldn't think about it markedly any differently as we project ahead. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. \nKelly Bania: Curious if you could just help us dissect the gross margin a little bit between the promotional activity, the inventory impairment versus the cost of storing and moving this excess inventory. Because I think it would just be a little helpful for investors to interpret that comp and traffic number and just how you're thinking about that traffic and comp as the promotions moderate into Q3. And it sounds like Q4, you're planning for very little promotional activity. So I was just wondering if you could kind of parse some of that out to help us think about that. \nMichael Fiddelke: I'll maybe start at the end of your question. We expect Q4 to be promotional.  It always is. And our plans plan for promotions that will provide great value to our guests and those seasonal moments that matter. That's been true in every Q4 in my 18 years here, and I expect it not to be any different this time around. \n With respect to unpacking the margin, I'll go back to some of what I said in my comments. And we were, year-over-year, 9 percentage points down,  7 of that is mostly driven by inventory actions and you see incremental markdowns as a piece of that. You also see the cost of some of those receipt cancellations that John talked about earlier. And then you see about 1.5 points of pressure from supply chain and digital. And a piece of that is related to us being heavier in the system and that drives some costs. A piece of that is the elevated freight and transportation rates that we've talked about previously, that will continue to kind of maybe move up and move down based on the day, are definitely elevated versus any historical measure. And you can see over that --  see that is a piece of that year-over-year pressure, too. \nOperator: Our next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: My question was on inflation in food and consumables. And can you give us any number on how much inflation you guys saw in the second quarter, but also the 2 half guide you guys have given us. What's the inflation tailwind you guys are expecting in food and consumables? And also related to that, you guys talked about the focus on everyday pricing. Is there any incremental margin pressure from the frequency items or the focus on everyday pricing being sharp? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I mean we've seen persistent cost inflation in food. And I think across the industry, you've seen price move with that. That's been no different here at Target. We are really mindful of making sure that we feel good about our price gaps, definitely do today in food. \n And if you zoom out from the food-specific piece of that, again, I'll come back to traffic. If you look at what drove our growth in the second quarter, there were some puts and takes within basket between ASP and units. But the story was traffic. And so again, that gives us evidence that we're getting that value equation right for our guests. \nRobert Ohmes: And is the inflation component within same-store sales in food and consumables? Is that similar to sort of the numbers we're seeing in the CPI for food at home? \nMichael Fiddelke: I think that's generally in the right ballpark. Obviously, there's some mix implications there if you're comparing retailer to retailer. But we've seen persistently high inflation in food. And I think that's a trend that's been with us for a while, and we don't expect it to change anytime soon. \nRobert Ohmes: And sorry, just to clarify, the pricing, folks, are you -- would you say you guys are investing in price in food and consumables? So maybe taking a lower margin in the grocery part of your business than maybe historically you would have. \nA. Hennington: No. Maybe I'll add a little context here. We're consistently evaluating our complete value proposition to the consumer. And so part of that is price. And in the consumables categories, we've had a little bit more flexibility to move with the market because it's domestically replenished and bought every single day. And so we have absolutely moved up in some retail. But the way we counterbalance total value proposition is by looking at, of course, what else produces value, compelling promotion, an incredible owned brand portfolio that allows the guests to opt-in to whatever price point is right for them and a maniacal focus on balancing our good, better, best and opening price point options. And that, the combination of those things, are yielding more unit share growth at Target, which means the guest is actively engaged in the offering that we're providing and, of course, that traffic that Michael pointed to. \nBrian Cornell: And Robby, as Christina noted, the strength of our owned brand portfolio in this environment is a really important element of how we deliver value to our guests each and every day. And in Food & Beverage, our Good & Gather brand now is a $2 billion brand that continues to see very strong growth. So that's just one way we deliver value to our guests each and every day at Target. \nOperator: Our final question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen. \nOliver Chen: On the topic of back-to-school, what would you speak to as factors that are most different this year versus last year as you get ready for that? And secondly, on the inventory actions, as they relate to third quarter, what's left to do there? And might you have to take deeper promotions than you thought previously? The consumer is requiring a lot of discounts to respond to promotions more than other retailers thought in many cases. Would love any thoughts there. \nBrian Cornell: Oliver, I'll start, and I'll let Michael finish up, but I think the one big difference today, as we sit here today and think about back-to-school and back-to-college is certainty. I think we know across the country, children are going back to school. They'll be in classrooms. They're going to be back on campus. So I think that element of certainty is very different from what we've faced over the last couple of years. And again, we expect to see a very solid back-to-school and back-to-college season because we know children are going to be in classrooms and will be back in campus, and Target's a place they go during this important back-to-school and back-to-college season. \nMichael Fiddelke: And then, Oliver, kind of what's in some of the Q4 actions we still have to take, just to provide kind of an example there. If there's seasonal product, it's a natural time to leave our store within Q3, and we'll continue to work through some of that inventory then. And so that's an example of some of the work still to be done. But kind of in where we started, we feel really good about our inventory position as we exit the second quarter. And we accomplished what we set out to do from an inventory perspective. \nJohn Hulbert: So operator, that concludes our second quarter call. We look forward to talking to many of you over the next few weeks and seeing you later this year, so thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. In past calls, I've described how our operations team is always focused on two things at the same time. Of course, they're always focused on short-term execution and problem-solving to ensure we provide a convenient, consistent and inspiring experience for our guests. In addition, our team works every day to deliver on our long-term vision and aspirations, ensuring our operations are ready to support our future plans. While this dual focus on both near-term and long-term priorities has always been present, it's been especially notable this year, given that we've been operating in a very unique environment. \n In terms of the short term, and as Brian and Christina mentioned earlier, our work to quickly rightsize inventory require determination, commitment and coordination between multiple teams across the company. And given the need to protect the guest experience, there was no higher priority than delivering against this near-term plan. At the same time, our team remains passionately focused on the long-term investments we're making in our future. These investments include our work to modernize and expand our store footprint, increase upstream capacity in our supply chain, automate distribution center processes to reduce store workload and enhance our last-mile fulfillment capabilities by opening sortation centers and integrating them into our Shipt network.  And fortunately, as Brian highlighted, the strength of our business allows us to continue funding these long-term investments even in the face of the challenging external backdrop we're facing today.  \n I want to first turn to our work on inventory. And I'm happy to report that our team has made remarkable progress over the last few months, causing conditions in our supply chain to improve significantly. More specifically, and to provide some helpful context, over time, we want to keep our DC network operating at or below 85% of its maximum capacity, given that operational difficulties and costs rise significantly when we move beyond that level. So it's important to note that back in June, inventory in our DC network peaked at well over 90% of our capacity. Also notable, by the end of the second quarter, less than 2 months later, our team had quickly reduced DC capacity utilization to below 80%.  \n Put another way, by the end of the second quarter, the physical space occupied by our distribution center inventory was more than 20% lower than the peak we reached in June. So today, while we still have some individual sites where we need to make more progress, the team has accomplished a remarkable improvement in a very short time, which will allow our end-to-end operations to function more efficiently and effectively in the back half of the year.  \n As Christina mentioned, beyond addressing the inventory we already owned, the team also took a hard look at sales trends and determined ideal inventory levels across every category for the remainder of the year. As a result, we've meaningfully reduced our fall season receipt commitments in many discretionary categories. With these reductions, we're projecting our DCs will remain at or below 85% capacity through the remainder of the year, even after the seasonal increase in holiday inventory that is set to occur over the next 2 months.  In other words, for the first time I am aware of, our fall season inventory is projected to peak at a lower level than in spring, providing another vivid illustration of the unique dynamics we've encountered so far this year.  \n While this inventory rightsizing process hasn't been easy and our teams have devoted an amazing amount of effort in a small amount of time, this work has allowed our teams to strengthen ongoing communication mechanisms and build new processes. Going forward, these improvements will enable our merchandising and supply chain teams to maintain enhanced real-time communication, particularly with respect to categories where we face the highest inventory risk, allowing us to respond to changes with more speed and agility.  \n While pressure from excess inventory has presented the biggest challenge to our team this year, dealing with high costs and volatility in the external supply chain has run a close second. And today, while conditions remain far from what we would have considered normal in the years before the pandemic, there are early signs that both costs and volatility may have peaked. More specifically, lead times in global shipping have begun to decline. Spot rates to move shipping containers have fallen somewhat. And in light of the reduction in petroleum prices we've all seen recently, fuel surcharges have been easing somewhat compared with the peak rates we saw earlier in the second quarter.  \n That said, conditions remain highly unfavorable when compared to the years before the pandemic, and we're mindful of the continued risks in the months ahead, including potential slowdowns at the West Coast ports, a reversal of the recent decline in energy costs and the possibility of additional COVID lockdowns in China.  \n In addition, we continue to encounter far too many delays affecting overseas shipping which require us to pay spot rates to move containers, rates that are well above our prenegotiated shipping rates. As such, we're maintaining our practice of moving receipt dates earlier than we would have in the past, which allows us to mitigate the business risk from receiving shipments later than expected.  \n You'll recall that at this time a year ago, when the external supply chain began slowing down and shipments were arriving late, we began relying on air freight much more than usual to ensure we receive key seasonal merchandise on time for the holiday season. While that was the right decision at the time given the circumstances we were facing, this year, we expect to meaningfully reduce our reliance on air freight by moving to early receipt dates for seasonal inventory. To accommodate these early receipts without adding further color to our supply chain in stores, we secured temporary capacity to store and stage shipping containers near the ports where we receive them. When needed, this allows us to quickly clear the containers from the port area and hold them until the ideal time to begin moving inventory into our supply chain network.  While we don't expect to need this additional capacity over the long term, we believe it's clearly the most efficient approach in today's environment, given the volatility we continue to face.  \n I also want to highlight the critical role that our stores have played in our work to improve conditions in our supply chain. During the second quarter, our store teams engaged in a host of activities to support the effort, including the execution of countless promotions and markdown programs to move the excess merchandise quickly and the development of innovative presentation strategies to highlight the deals we were offering our guests. This included repurposing the seasonal presentation space in our stores to highlight deals and create meaningful statements, including key item promotions. It also included the early wind down of our outdoor living assortment, which allowed us to bring in our back-to-school set earlier than usual, ensuring we are back in stock and reliable on key items parents needed to fill their back-to-school shopping list.  \n More specifically, at the end of the second quarter, about 3/4 of our back-to-school and back-to-college receipts were already downstream in our stores, a number that was closer to 50% at the end of Q2 a year ago.  \n So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to turn my focus to our longer-term priorities and the multiple ways we're investing in our future growth. As you know, the majority of our CapEx is going into our store network, both to extend our footprint and invest in existing locations. These store investments fall into 3 major buckets. The first and largest investment is in our store remodel program, where we completely transform the space in an existing location, modernizing the shopping experience while enhancing the productivity of our team. At this point in the year, well over 100 remodels are currently in flight across the country, keeping us on track to complete nearly 200 remodels this year.  \n In addition to these complete transformations, we're also making smaller investments in hundreds of other locations. This includes the hundreds of fulfillment remodels we'll accomplish this year, in which we reconfigure portions of the store to enhance the efficiency, safety and capacity of our drive-up, in-store pickup and ship-from-store services. In addition, this year, we're investing in several hundred locations to add an Ulta Beauty at Target, a co-branded Apple shopping space or a Disney store presentation to the sales floor. And finally, we're on track to add about 24 new store locations in 2022. So far this year, we've opened 12 new locations across the country, in neighborhoods as diverse as SoHo in New York and Jackson Hole in Wyoming.  \n Beyond this work in stores, we're also making significant investments in our supply chain focused on 3 main priorities. The first is to build additional upstream capacity to our network, given that we continue to grow sales on top of the $27 billion we added in 2020 and 2021.  In support of this goal, we opened 2 upstream DCs near the end of 2021 and plan to open 6 new upstream facilities over the next several years, including 2 on track to open in 2023. \n In addition to the space we're adding to the network, we're continuing to modernize how our existing distribution centers serve our stores by developing and automating processes that reduce the amount of store workload devoted to receiving inventory and restocking store sales floors. And finally, we're rapidly expanding the number of sortation centers operating around the country. We have 6 of these facilities operating today, including 3 that have opened in the last few months, and we have plans to add 5 more by early next year. These small facilities expand ship-from-store capacity in the locations they serve while significantly reducing last-mile delivery costs, particularly as we integrate our Shipt drivers into the process.  \n Given the package delivery density we've achieved across many markets over the last few years, we see continued opportunities to add more sortation centers over the next few years, which adds speed and significantly reduce last-mile costs in markets where they operate.  \n As I mentioned last quarter, this year's capital projects are being impacted by the cost increases, material shortages and supply chain pressures that are affecting other parts of our business. And I'm really proud of how our construction team is managing through these headwinds. More specifically, while cost increases are raising the cost of many of these projects, the team has done an excellent job in keeping the vast majority of projects on track and on time despite the significant headwinds they are facing. \n So as I conclude my remarks, I have to pause and add my thanks to the entire team for their resilience and perseverance during a period of incredibly rapid change, which caused this quarter to be as challenging as any I've seen in my career. In the face of that challenge, what's been amazing is how our team members have stayed positive, how they've worked to find collaborative solutions across multiple teams and never strayed from their commitment to our guests and our company purpose. With the progress they have made, our operations are now in much better shape, and the team is energized and ready to play offense in the back half of the year.  \n While we are all mindful of the near-term volatility in the environment, it's times like these that often present the biggest opportunity to gain long-term market share as others face the distraction of trying to stay afloat while we continue to invest and improve our operations. That's one of many reasons that I've never been more optimistic about our prospects in the years ahead.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Yes. Ed, I'll just add on it. I think largely, we're on track with what we thought at the -- when we came out with the announcement earlier in Q2. A little bit of it cost us a little bit more in promos or clearance to move some inventory. But I think the work the team did in a very short amount of time to size what we needed to take care of is largely in line with where we are today, and we feel really good about where we're at. \n As Michael said, a little bit spilled over into Q3, and that's really just timing more than anything else. We just didn't get to it. But the work that's been done, we're really proud of. And I would say, from my position, we did exactly what we set out to do. We got rid of the inventory we needed to, the operations are in a much better place. There's a little bit more to do here in Q3 that will clean up. \n And I think the one thing I'd add on that I don't want to get lost is the amount of receipts that were cut from discretionary categories in Q3 and Q4, and that is just huge for us, again, because of the uncertainty in those particular categories. And if sales end up a little bit higher, we'll have a little bit higher sell-through, and that will be a great day. But that really derisks those categories going forward. So we feel great about the work that's been done over the past few months."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Back in June, we announced that our team would be undertaking a bold effort to rightsize our inventory position in the categories through which demand patterns have rapidly changed.  \n While this decision had a meaningful short-term impact on our financial results, we strongly believe it was the best path forward. Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly, over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact, it would have held back our business over time. Of course, this decision would have driven incremental costs to store and manage the excess inventory over a longer period. But much more importantly, it would have degraded the guest experience. It would have cluttered our sales force and hampered our ability to present new, fresh and fashionable items, the ones our guests expect from Target.  \n Just as importantly, the extra inventory would have presented an ongoing burden to our supply chain and store teams, as they face the distraction of working around it day after day. Instead of taking that passive position, our team chose a more decisive path, aggressively reducing the inventory we already owned and cutting back on receipts for the back half of the year. And today, with those decisions behind us, we're in a much better position as we head into the fall season.  \n As you'll hear in more detail, we've meaningfully reduced our ownership and commitments in categories where we've seen softening demand. This has allowed us to strengthen our inventory position and in-stock position in the categories that are driving our growth, most notably in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials.  \n Regarding the financial impact of those decisions, Michael will provide more details in a few minutes. But the high-level story is, the vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us. This positions our business to deliver a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season. However, beyond financial and operational outcomes, I'm focused on how our inventory actions will benefit our guests and our team. Regarding our guests, we're now positioned to continue driving engagement and growing traffic with a clean, safe and uncluttered store experience and an assortment that highlights newness and supports growth. For our team, this quarter's inventory actions will enable them to focus on doing what they do best: providing a great guest experience while reducing the strengths and distraction from overly crowded store backrooms and distribution facilities.  \n After we announced the rightsizing effort at the beginning of June, I have heard from countless leaders across the company, who wanted to relay their gratitude for the decision to move quickly and face the issue head-on.  \n In the same spirit, I want to pause and acknowledge the incredible effort of the entire Target team during a very challenging time for the economy, for our industry and our business. Our success in reducing inventory was a result of unprecedented effort, coordination and collaboration across multiple teams, from our U.S. headquarters to our Target India headquarters, to our stores, distribution centers, transportation team and sourcing offices around the world. And today, in the face of a very challenging backdrop, I'm proud of how our team and business model continue to serve our guests' evolving needs. Everything we do, from the design of our operating model to the way we train our team, is done with a focus on better serving our guests.  \n It's reflected in how we choose our assortment, where we curate a broad range of items, both in-store and online, from the stylish to the functional, incorporating quality and value throughout. It's also evident in how we design our store and the digital shopping experience that make them easy, convenient and inspirational, inviting guests to choose the right option every time they shop.  All of these decisions make our business model more durable, allowing us to drive deeper guest engagement and grow traffic in every environment.  \n Consistent with the shopping trends we've seen for more than a year, our second quarter comp increase of 2.6% was driven entirely by traffic, which expanded 2.7% this year, on top of double-digit growth a year ago. With this increase, second quarter traffic has expanded by well over 20% since 2019. In raw numbers, that means in the second quarter alone, we've added more than 90 million guest visits over the last 3 years.  \n These visits are a vivid demonstration of a deepening level of guest engagement resulting from multiple investments throughout our business. These investments include dozens of new stores and hundreds of remodels every year. They also include investments in our industry-leading same-day services, which have transformed our business in a short time. More specifically, 3 years ago, in the second quarter of 2019, digital fulfillment accounted for just over 7% of total sales. In contrast, by the second quarter of this year, the same-day portion of our digital sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales. This drove our total digital penetration up to almost 18%, more than doubling in only 3 years.  \n Beyond our stores and fulfillment services, guests continue to respond to our investments in our own brand portfolio. This portfolio delivers more than $30 billion in annual sales, and includes 12 brands that generate more than $1 billion each. At the same time, we're investing in new spaces and presentation for key national brand partners like Apple, Disney and Levi's. And of course, we've been rapidly expanding the number of stores that feature an Ulta Beauty at Target given the incremental traffic and sales they deliver. But nothing has been more important than the investments we made in our team. These investments include the move to a starting hourly wage range of $15 to $24 across the country, enhanced health care and wellness benefits for a larger percentage of our team, the rollout of an industry-leading debt-free college educational plan and our work to enhance the growth and development opportunities available to all of our team members, and the team members of color in particular.  \n As we look ahead to the back half of the year, the team is laser-focused on delivering convenience, value and joy at a time when our guests are facing multiple challenges. And while we've taken a cautious stance on our inventory commitments, we'll continue to lean into frequency categories where guest demand has been strong and where the markdown risks are very low.  \n In addition, given the ongoing pressure our guests are facing from inflation, we're leaning into value. This means we're focused on providing great everyday pricing and strong opening price points across every category, including in our own brands. At the same time, we hear from our guests that they're focused on celebrating the seasonal moments they missed over the last 2 years. As a result, we'll lean into those seasonal moments, helping our guests find ways to come together and celebrate with family and friends.  \n So we still have a lot of business ahead of us. We've seen an encouraging start to the back-to-school and back-to-college season, and our teams are already deep into their planning for the upcoming Halloween season, a time when we expect our guests will fully embrace trick-or-treating and scheduling parties to celebrate with family, friends and neighbors.  \n Given continued volatility in the external environment, we built our fall plans with a priority on flexibility and agility, and that's where our business model shines. More specifically, our multi-category portfolio stays relevant and drive strips across a wide range of wants and needs.  \n In today's environment, that means our Food & Beverage category is front and center, having grown more than 50%, or $1.8 billion since the second quarter of 2019. But regardless of whether a Target Run begins with a need for an item in food and beverage or household essentials, to see what's new in our beauty assortment, the pick of a toy for a birthday party or a piece of luggage for an upcoming trip, our safe one-stop shopping experience provides an opportunity to sell items in every one of our categories on every guest visit.  \n Beyond our assortment, our unique stores-as-hubs operating model offers unmatched flexibility in how we can fulfill guest demand. Whether a guest wants to make a conventional in-store shopping trip, place a drive-up order, arrange a Shipt delivery or simply have a box delivered to their front door, stores can fulfill every one of those needs quickly and reliably, allowing our guests to choose what works best for them in that moment.  \n And as Michael will outline in more detail, our strong balance sheet and robust cash generation support continued investments during tough times like these, investments in our long-term growth and market share.  \n At a time when many others will be struggling just to survive, the ability to play offense and focus on the long term makes us well positioned to emerge from the current downturn even stronger than before.  \n So as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to thank our team for their continued passion for serving our guests and each other. While the environment remains challenging, I'm inspired by the new and unique merchandise, seasonal offerings and partnerships our team has planned for the back half of the year. And as I've traveled across the country to visit our stores and distribution centers, I've been inspired to hear how our team is energized and eager to serve our guests with energy, empathy and care, bringing some daily joy at a time when our guests are dealing with multiple headwinds. This unshakable guest focus is one of the many reasons our unique team makes Target a great company, and I am privileged and grateful to serve with them.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. Thanks, Michael. I often tell my team that leadership and performance are tightly linked over time, but that leadership often appears first. That's why I'm extremely proud of the leadership our team showed in the second quarter. After they took a hard look at our owned inventory position and the amount that was building up across our industry, they opted to make the hard choice: get in front of the problem and address it head-on. \n They made that decision with the full knowledge it would have a profound impact on our near-term profitability. They also knew there was another path. We could have avoided attacking the problem and avoid some of the pain in the short run. But instead, our team chose to lead. They knew the best path for our guests and for our teams in our stores and distribution centers was to take action and improve the condition of our inventory and operations quickly. That path would allow the entire Target team to move ahead without facing the ongoing burden of excess inventory holding us back. \n So the team quickly developed the [ bolder ] plan, which we announced in early June, just over 2 months ago. And in the intervening weeks, teams across the company worked tirelessly to take the plan and make it a reality. That's the reason we're positioned to deliver a strong improvement in our profitability this fall despite an environment that's far from ideal. Because of our team's leadership, our business today is much better positioned to perform, and I couldn't be more proud and grateful for the courage they have shown. \n So with that, I want to thank you for listening into our call today. And now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Chris, thanks for joining us this morning. I'll let Christina talk about some of the back-to-school and back-to-college trends and Michael to build on guidance. But before we start, based on the length of our prepared comments, we are going to ask for some additional time for Q&A. So operator, we're going to extend the time for this call to make sure we cover as many questions as possible. \n Christina, do you want to start by talking about some of the back-to-school and back-to-college trends we're seeing? Chris, I'll let Michael talk about guidance. But one of the things that really stands out for me as I look at our position today, is that continued strength in traffic and the growth we're seeing in units across our entire portfolio. I'd also recognize, based on the actions we've taken with our inventory position, if you walk our stores today, it is clear that we are prepared for back-to-school and back-to-college, and we're really standing tall in those categories. \n Mike, do we want to talk about the guidance? Chris, I'll add one final point. As we talk to our guests, when we talk to consumers, while there's certainly a cautionary environment in front of us, but one thing that seems to be very consistent is a guest and consumer who says they want to celebrate the holiday seasons. So we certainly expect that they are going to be celebrating Halloween this year and actively trick-or-treating and hosting parties with friends and family. We know they're looking forward to Thanksgiving, and they're going to look forward to celebrating the Christmas holidays. And that comes out each and every week as we survey consumers and talk to our guests. So that gives us great optimism for our ability to perform during these key holiday seasons. And I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the inventory actions, but I really want to start by recognizing our team. I think as we sit here today, over the last few weeks since our announcement in June, this has been a collaborative effort, and the team has accomplished so much to put us in the right place as we get ready for the back half of the year. So based on the work that the teams have done across our supply chain system, in merchandising, in finance and supply chain, in stores, the team has accomplished more than we expected in a short period of time and put us in a better position from an inventory standpoint than we might have expected back in June. And Steph, I'd only add that Christina and her team have done a wonderful job as we plan for the back half of the year, of ensuring that we have great value for our guests but also that we have exciting newness. And I think that combination is a winning formula for us as we think about the back half of the year. Michael, I'll start by saying, I think your summary really captures the actions we've been taking today really to make sure that we continue to build on the traffic we're seeing in our stores and the visits to our site, the strength we're seeing in unit market share gains; but importantly, the investments we made to ensure we have a great guest experience in the back half of the year and going into 2023. So the bold, decisive actions were really to make sure we continue to build on our current momentum, the great relationship we have with our guests, the momentum we're building from a market share standpoint and providing our guests with a great Target experience every time they shop. That will continue and set us up well for 2023. \n As far as sizing it, we'll certainly come back to all of you as we think about guidance for next year, but we certainly expect to see a more normalized environment from an operating profit standpoint as we move into 2023 and continue to build on the momentum and the investments we've been making in our business for years. And Robby, as Christina noted, the strength of our owned brand portfolio in this environment is a really important element of how we deliver value to our guests each and every day. And in Food & Beverage, our Good & Gather brand now is a $2 billion brand that continues to see very strong growth. So that's just one way we deliver value to our guests each and every day at Target. Oliver, I'll start, and I'll let Michael finish up, but I think the one big difference today, as we sit here today and think about back-to-school and back-to-college is certainty. I think we know across the country, children are going back to school. They'll be in classrooms. They're going to be back on campus. So I think that element of certainty is very different from what we've faced over the last couple of years. And again, we expect to see a very solid back-to-school and back-to-college season because we know children are going to be in classrooms and will be back in campus, and Target's a place they go during this important back-to-school and back-to-college season."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the tough environment we are facing today, I continue to be pleased with both our top line performance and the underlying market share we're seeing across our business: namely, across all 5 of our core merchandising categories. We saw unit share gains in the second quarter, providing clear evidence that our guests are finding more and more ways to satisfy their wants and needs with every Target Run.  \n As Brian mentioned earlier, the inventory actions we announced in June involved incredible collaboration across teams at headquarters, stores and throughout our supply chain network. And I'm proud to say that together as one team, we accomplished what we set out to do. By moving through excess units, we were able to realign our broader inventory portfolio to those categories our guests are most focused on, including frequency categories like Food & Beverage, Everyday Essentials and Beauty as well as all things new, seasonal and fashion-forward.  \n To accomplish that goal, teams analyzed and built action plans to aggressively work through excess inventory at every point along the product journey, from vendor to guests. This included rigorously reforecasting expectations for the balance of the year and beyond and determining where to reduce future receipts and orders. In some cases, they meant working with vendor partners to reduce our fall receipts in light of our updated expectations. It also meant quickly building compelling promotional plans to drive unit velocity for product we already owned, all with a focus on providing great value and generating excitement for our guests. And throughout the execution of these action plans, our teams remain steadfast in their guests-first focus, refusing to compromise the shopping experience in our stores or online.  \n As you heard from Brian, the short-term profit implications of these decisions were meaningful, but we're confident they're the right long-term decisions for our business, for our teams and for our guests.  As we formed and revisited our plans for the third quarter and beyond, we spent a lot of time listening to the wants, needs, hopes and concerns of our guests. What we're seeing in our results and hearing from our guests is that they still have spending power, but they're increasingly feeling the impact of inflation. And while the recent reduction in prices at the gas pump has been encouraging, guest confidence in their personal finances continues to wane.  \n Against that backdrop, we've seen our guests shop our owned brands in bigger ways and more frequently, knowing they are choosing great quality products with incredible value. We've also seen guest behavior evolve as they focus on optimizing their personal budgets through a heightened response to promotions as well as greater trip consolidation.  \n At the same time, guests continue to experience difficult news headlines, COVID surges and continued political volatility, leading them to seek more ways to celebrate, connect and find opportunities to bring joy to their families. This is one of the reasons we continue to see such strength in our seasonal categories, which we expect will continue in the back half of the year.  \n Now let me turn to some of the category highlights from the second quarter, in which overall comparable sales grew 2.6%, on top of 8.9% a year ago, reflecting continued strength in Food & Beverage, Beauty and Household Essentials.  \n Food & Beverage led the way in the quarter with growth in the low double digits, reflecting broad strength across multiple subcategories. Beauty grew in the high single digits, reflecting notable strength in Ulta Beauty at Target, along with the skincare and bath categories. Essentials grew in the mid-single digits with performance led by pets and health care. Overall, across our discretionary categories, sales were softer than a year ago, but remained nearly $3.5 billion or more than 35% higher than the second quarter of 2019.  \n In Hardlines, overall comp sales were down slightly to last year. Within Hardlines, softness in electronics was partially offset by strength in entertainment, which grew in the high single digits, along with high single-digit comp growth in toys, an encouraging sign as we plan for the fourth quarter holiday season.  \n Overall, the Home category saw a low single-digit decline compared to last year despite affinity for our seasonal assortments and encouraging early results in back-to-school and back-to-college.  \n Apparel also saw a low single-digit decline in the second quarter but saw meaningful growth in women's fashion-forward categories, along with performance apparel, on top of strong sales growth in the category over the past 2 years.  \n As I mentioned earlier, while overall sales growth is one key indicator of the health of our business, market share is an equally important measure that we use to understand how we're performing. And notably, during inflationary times like these, we heavily focus on unit share, specifically to better understand our relevance as compared to our competitive set, given that growth in both traffic and units is a strong proxy for the guests' overall engagement with Target. Time and time again, these metrics have proven to be a better barometer for lasting success as compared to growth solely through average retail prices. That's why I'm so encouraged that across all 5 of our core merchandising categories, we grew unit share in the second quarter.  \n So now let's turn our sights to all that is to come for the balance of the fiscal year. Having celebrated holidays in a big way in the second quarter, guests already have their sights set on upcoming holidays and seasonal moments in Q3 and beyond. Preparing for the upcoming school year is top of mind for families right now. And to help with the transition, we're providing budget-friendly options for students, parents and teachers alike. Beyond our assortment of value-priced owned brands and leading national brands, we're offering a onetime 20% off Target Circle deal for college students to get those dorm rooms prepped and ready. And we've also extended our teacher prep event to nearly 8 weeks of discounts on supplies and more.  \n And today, while we still have several weeks of the season left to go, we've been encouraged by early results in both our back-to-school and back-to-college programs. Shortly after school begins, we'll turn our attention to celebrating Latino Heritage Month, which begins in the middle of September. We're excited to help celebrate this important cultural moment with our guests through the presentation of a compelling assortment, 99% of which was created by members of the Hispanic/Latino community. Then before we know it, Halloween celebrations will be underway, with all the tricks and treats the season has to offer. Our guest research indicates that more families plan to participate in Halloween festivities compared with last year, and we're ready with a wide array of gender and size inclusive costumes, new owned brand trick-or-treating candy and accessories, haunted house cookie building sets and so much more.  \n And for those that want to celebrate the broader fall and harvest season in general, rest assured that there will be no shortage of new offerings from Good & Gather to create perfect meal, snacking and entertaining solutions, including delicious new flavors of the season like maple, cinnamon, apple and, of course, all things pumpkin spice.  \n Outside of specific holidays, we are focused on helping our guests experience Everyday Joy, and our ability to cut across brands and categories is part of what makes us uniquely Target. For an example, look no further than our upcoming collaboration this fall with Marvel to bring a unique assortment to our guests across the Avengers and Spider-Man franchises. One standout will be lots of Marvel Studios' Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Black Panther Legacy exclusives within toys, Apparel, Home and more. We'll have more details to share in the coming months.  \n And in an exciting collaboration with long-time partner, The LEGO Group, we are bringing their popular LEGO Ideas contest to Target, in which LEGO superfans submit ideas for a themed LEGO building set. After a public submission phase, a handful of finalists will be selected for guests and fans to choose their favorite idea to be produced as an exclusive set at Target and LEGO brand retail stores. \n But Target Joy goes well beyond key holidays or exclusive launches. It's about how we continue to iterate and improve upon what our guests already know and love from their regular Target Run. This next quarter, you'll see us elevate our fashion assortment with several new collections and updated brands. We'll introduce new well-known national brands in cookware and kitchen. We'll also continue to expand our leading national brand partnerships, including opening more Disney stores and, of course, Ulta Beauty at Target. \n In fact, we're only a year into this new partnership, and there's plenty of room to grow ahead. With the introduction of new designer fragrance brands, including Coach, Clinique, Kate Spade and more as well as additional skin and hair care products, we continue to evolve the assortment to bring more joy to our Beauty guests. We remain on track to open at least 250 of these unique spaces this year. Plus, we've already seen more than 1.5 million guests link their Target Circle and Ultamate Rewards accounts, a number that's sure to continue to grow in the months and years ahead.  \n So now before I pass things over to John, I'd like to take a moment and echo Brian's gratitude for the team. While we have demonstrated time and time again that our durable, flexible model can quickly pivot with changing consumer demands and a host of retail and economic conditions, none of that can happen without an incredible team. Their talent, dedication, passion and expertise allows us to continue putting the Target guests at the center of every decision we make. As a result, we continue to benefit from deeper guest loyalty and preference for our brand. \n I have been at Target 19 years, and I continue to be inspired every day by the talent around me. Thank you for your commitment and care to all our stakeholders.  \n With that, I'll pass things over to John. Yes. As I shared earlier in my prepared remarks, we're optimistic about what back-to-school and back-to-college mean. This -- during seasonal times is when Target really shines, the reason being that our multi-category portfolio makes us even more relevant, the opportunity to buy kids uniform, backpacks, the school -- the lunch kit and everything that goes in it and, of course, all the supplies. And so they've always -- seasonal moments have always been a good proxy for the strength of the total portfolio. And so as we're seeing good early trends, albeit there's a lot of business left to be done, we believe that, that is a good indicator of the strength of the potential for the fall. The other thing to look at, of course, is how we have performed to date, and our traffic and unit share growth that we've seen across the portfolio holistically gives us confidence in the guest choice of Target as their retailer of preference. And Ed, maybe I can add a little bit to the question about the customer. As I shared in my prepared remarks, our guest is still demonstrating that they have spending power. The choices that they're making to balance their budget is what we're watching. And so obviously, we're moderating our investment in some of those discretionary businesses, and we're leaning very much into Food & Beverage, Essentials, Beauty, but also select portions of the portfolio and discretionary that have stayed resilient, whether it's toys, luggage, seasonal moments, fashion-forward apparel. And so it's really about reading the guests listening to them and continuing to support a level of agility in the business model. And in terms of other choices that they're making, I think traffic and unit share are the best barometer for their investment in Target. We're still growing traffic, and we're growing unit share in every major category, which to me says that our relevance is high with the guests right now and they're managing their budgets as best fit and they're finding options at Target. No. Maybe I'll add a little context here. We're consistently evaluating our complete value proposition to the consumer. And so part of that is price. And in the consumables categories, we've had a little bit more flexibility to move with the market because it's domestically replenished and bought every single day. And so we have absolutely moved up in some retail. But the way we counterbalance total value proposition is by looking at, of course, what else produces value, compelling promotion, an incredible owned brand portfolio that allows the guests to opt-in to whatever price point is right for them and a maniacal focus on balancing our good, better, best and opening price point options. And that, the combination of those things, are yielding more unit share growth at Target, which means the guest is actively engaged in the offering that we're providing and, of course, that traffic that Michael pointed to."

            "content": "Thanks, John. As John mentioned, we often ask our team to be mindful of both short-term and long-term considerations when making decisions. And given the unique circumstances we've been facing, this quarter, we faced a decision with meaningful implications for both. As Brian outlined earlier, if we had decided not to deal with our excess inventory head-on, we could have avoided some short-term pain on the profit line, but that would have hampered our longer-term potential. Instead, because of the path we took, our quarterly profit took a meaningful step-down, but our future path is brighter. Our operations are healthy, our store and DC teams have more flexibility to maneuver and we're ready to feature both the fresh assortment and uncluttered shopping experience our guests expect and deserve. That passionate commitment to the guest experience is one of the many reasons we've now seen 21 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth. \n While normally our income statement gets the most attention, I want to start my remarks today with the balance sheet and specifically, our inventory position. And as I dig into the detail, I want to acknowledge upfront that this kind of analysis is a relatively complex exercise because of the growth and volatility we've experienced over the last couple of years, because of the broad and diverse assortment that we sell and the fact that our business is seasonal from quarter-to-quarter. \n More specifically, given that our inventory position throughout the pandemic was far from optimal, focusing on year-over-year growth numbers isn't very helpful right now. As a result, we often base our inventory analysis on growth trends compared with 2019, a pre-pandemic year when our inventory and sales trends were much more in sync.\n With that as context, I want to zero in on one of the questions I'm sure you have, which is why our inventory on the balance sheet remained roughly constant at around $15 billion between the first and second quarters. The simple answer is that while that single number didn't change much, we accomplished exactly what we intended to do during the quarter, which helped change conditions significantly below the surface. \n More specifically, because of the inventory actions we executed, unit growth compared with 2019 in our discretionary categories decelerated by more than 15 percentage points between the first and second quarter, a change we estimate would have reduced our inventory position by more than $1 billion if taken in isolation. \n However, a couple of offsetting changes moved our quarter-end inventory in the other direction. First among them, we leaned into our frequency categories during the quarter, accelerating 3-year unit growth versus Q1 at a double-digit rate, resulting in stronger in-stock metrics compared with 90 days ago. Another factor that drove inventory dollars higher is the continued increase in unit costs we've been seeing across all of our categories, which caused the dollar value of our inventory to grow faster than unit growth in the second quarter.\n So where do we stand today? At the end of the second quarter, inventory on the balance sheet was about $6 billion higher than we reported 3 years ago. Of that dollar growth, about $3 billion or approximately half of that total growth is the result of higher unit costs across our assortment. Of the remaining $3 billion, our analysis indicates another $1 billion to $2 billion is related to our decision to move receipt timing earlier, given the volatility we continue to expect in the supply chain. And also importantly, beyond reshaping the inventory we already have, our Q2 inventory actions also included the removal of more than $1.5 billion of fall receipts in our discretionary categories, reflecting our continued focus on reducing risk in the current environment. That's why we feel good about our inventory position as we head into the back half of the year. \n So now I'll turn to a review of our second quarter financial results. Total sales increased 3.3% in the quarter, driven by a 2.6% increase in comparable sales, combined with the impact of new stores. Total revenue increased 3.5%, reflecting sales growth along with the benefit of nearly 15% growth on the other revenue line, driven by continued strength in our Roundel ad business. \n Just as Christina pointed out, that unit share is a key measure of Target's relevance versus competitors, traffic growth is another important indicator of the relevance of our brand. Our continued traffic growth in the second quarter clearly demonstrates the ability of our balanced multi-category assortment to deliver continued relevance in a rapidly changing environment like we're seeing today. So that even as our guests' preference for individual categories has been changing dramatically so far this year, that hasn't affected their preference for Target. As a result, traffic accounted for 100% of our comparable sales growth in the second quarter, increasing 2.7%, on top of 12.7% a year ago. Average ticket remained essentially flat in the quarter, as low single-digit increase in average retail was offset by a similar reduction in the number of items per transaction. \n Across our sales channels, store comps grew 1.3%, on top of 8.7% a year ago, while digital comps grew 9%, on top of 9.9% last year. Digital growth continues to be led by our same-day services, which saw double-digit growth overall and mid-teens growth in drive-up. \n On the gross margin line, we saw a nearly 9 percentage point decline compared with last year. Merchandising accounted for more than 7 points of this pressure, driven primarily by our inventory reduction efforts, along with the impact of higher fuel and transportation costs, product cost increases and higher shrink, partially offset by the benefit of retail price increases. \n In addition, digital fulfillment and supply chain drove about 1.5 points of pressure, reflecting increased compensation and headcount in our distribution centers, combined with the cost of managing excess inventory and higher last-mile shipping costs. Consistent with the first quarter, mix accounted for approximately 10 basis points of pressure. The softness in higher-margin categories like Apparel and Home was largely offset by softness in lower-margin discretionary categories, most notably electronics. \n On the SG&A line, we continue to benefit from fixed cost leverage and efficiency gains across our operations, which helped to offset the impact of cost inflation across multiple expense lines. Within overall compensation, lower incentive compensation more than offset continued investments in pay and benefits for our hourly team members. \n Altogether, our second quarter operating margin rate was 1.2%, down from an unusually high 9.8% a year ago, driven entirely by the decline in our gross margin rate. This operating margin performance was below the midpoint of our most recent guidance, as the cost of our inventory actions was somewhat higher than expected. \n While an operating margin rate of just over 1% is well below anything I've seen in my career and something I never expect to see again, I have no doubt that it was the right outcome given the unusual circumstances we've been facing this year. Our focus throughout the second quarter was to ensure that we took care of the excess inventory of our network and adjust future receipts to reflect the rapid change in sales trends we've seen so far this year. We accomplished this goal to the benefit of our operations, our team and our guests. \n Finally, one note on our tax rate. In a period like this year, when our operating profit is unusually low, tax benefits have a larger-than-normal impact on our tax rate, which helps to explain why our year-to-date tax rate has been lower than expected. Looking forward, given that we anticipate a meaningful improvement in our operating performance in the back half of the year, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate will be in a range around 21%.\n Now I'm going to turn to capital deployment and begin where I always do by articulating our priorities, which we've supported consistently for decades. Our first priority is always to invest fully in our business, in projects that support our strategic and financial criteria. Once we've met this first priority, we support our dividend and look to extend our 50-year record of annual increases. And finally, once we've supported the first 2 priorities, we return any remaining excess cash by repurchasing our shares over time, within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Regarding the first priority, second quarter CapEx was approximately $1.5 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to just over $2.5 billion. As you'll recall, at the beginning of the year, we guided to an expected full year CapEx range of $4 billion to $5 billion. And at the time, I indicated my hope that we'd reach the high end of that range, with the outcome depending on how many capital projects could stay on schedule. \n So I'm happy that, as John mentioned, the team is doing a great job of keeping projects on track despite facing multiple headwinds, all while inflation in the cost of equipment, materials and labor is driving project spending above initial projections. As such, we now expect our full year CapEx will be $5 billion or more for the year, reflecting both the number of projects that remain on track and the expected impact of cost inflation.\n Of course, while we prefer not to face the cost pressure on these projects, I'm encouraged that so many value-creating projects remain on track to be completed this year, projects that will benefit our operations and our P&L for years to come. \n Turning to our second capital deployment priority. We returned $417 million in dividends to our shareholders in the second quarter, up from $336 million a year ago, driven by a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in average share count. \n And finally, in June, we reached the final settlement for the accelerated share repurchase agreement we initiated last March. Under this ASR, we invested $2.6 billion to retire 12.5 million shares of our stock. Looking forward, just as our inventory commitments reflect continued caution for the remainder of the year, we're taking a similar cautious stance in terms of our share repurchase activity. And of course, any repurchase activity will be consistent with our long-term goal to maintain our middle A credit ratings. \n So now I want to close my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures both our near-term profitability and the efficiency of our CapEx decisions over time. In the second quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 18.4% compared with 31.7% a year ago. And it's notable, while the current number is well below where we expect to operate over time, an after-tax number in the high teens would have been considered aspirational for our business only a few years ago. So for us to temporarily move down to this level in an environment as challenging as we're facing is a vivid confirmation of the underlying strength and resilience of our business model, and the reason we continue to be incredibly optimistic about our future prospects. \n And that confidence starts and ends with our team, so I want to pause and express my gratitude to the best team in retail. Without your efforts, we couldn't have achieved the remarkable growth in traffic and sales that we've seen over the last few years and why even in a tough year, our business remains strong. \n Now let's turn to our guidance. And based on the hard work of our team in the second quarter, we feel really good about how we're positioned going into the back half of the year. At the same time, given that we've been experiencing volatile economic conditions so far this year and that volatility appears likely to continue in the months ahead, we're maintaining a cautious stance as we plan our business given the potential macro and consumer risks that might emerge. That's why, as you've heard throughout our remarks today, our second quarter inventory actions were specifically designed to reduce our level of risk in discretionary categories. And in terms of our operations, the team has focused on building flexibility into our plans, placing a premium on staying nimble and adjusting quickly in the face of any potential change in macro trends. \n Regarding the top line, our expectations have remained consistent so far this year, with guidance for full year total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. With the front half of the year behind us, both our Q1 and Q2 results have put us squarely in the middle of that range. And today, based on our current performance and plans for the back half of the year, we remain positioned to deliver full year revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. \n On the operating margin line, our most recent guidance anticipated a fall season operating margin rate and a range centered around 6%. This expectation is nearly double our spring result. And notably, if we hit that rate in the fall, it would exceed the fall season rates we were delivering prior to the pandemic. And today, similar to my commentary on the top line, based on the success of our Q2 inventory actions and our current performance, we remain positioned to deliver an operating margin rate in a range around 6% in the fall season. \n Between the last 2 quarters of the year, we expect our third quarter rate will be well below our Q3 performance over the last couple of years, while our fourth quarter rate should be much more in line with our recent Q4 experience. Most notably, in the third quarter, we'll continue to experience some spillover impact from our inventory actions in the range of $200 million. In contrast, in Q4, we'll be annualizing meaningful cost headwinds that surfaced a year ago, which will make the year-over-year comparison more favorable despite the current headwinds we're facing. \n All that said, while we typically anticipate something closer to a balance of upside and downside potential when we make any forecast, the macro and consumer risks in the back half of this year feel skewed to the downside. That's why even in the face of consistent business trends in recent months, we've undertaken the significant cost and effort to remove risk from our inventory commitments. It's why we're stubbornly focused on real-time monitoring and communication of evolving conditions, and why we've asked our team to build flexibility and agility into their plans. With that mindset, if trends move away from what we're seeing today, we're ready to quickly adjust. \n So now before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to emphasize why we're so confident in our long-term potential, even as we navigate a very challenging environment in a year of multiple challenges, including rapidly changing consumer preferences, inflation at 40-year highs, volatile supply chain conditions and rising fuel and transportation rates that are expected to add well over $1 billion of cost this year. Our business continues to generate historically strong traffic increases, low to mid-single-digit revenue growth and unit share gains across all of our core merchandising categories. \n And even in the face of unprecedented profit rate pressure driven by the host of factors I just listed, we remain profitable with an after-tax ROIC in the mid-teens. In fact, if our performance in the fall is consistent with the revenue growth and operating margin rates I outlined earlier, we remain positioned in 2022 to generate higher operating margin dollars than we did in 2019. That's what we mean when we say we have built a durable model. \n And today, while we expect conditions to remain challenging in the near term, the operating margin rate improvement we're projecting in the back half of the year should serve as an early indicator of the continued rate improvement we should deliver in the years ahead. With the potential for additional rate expansion and continued growth in traffic and revenue in the years ahead, we're facing a compelling financial picture as the economy and consumer eventually recover.  That's why I've never been more confident in our long-term prospects than I am today. \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Yes. And I'll build off the comment you just made, Brian. When we look at the quarter, Chris, a lot of the trends we see in Q2 are informing our view of the back half of the year. And I think Q2 is a pretty good proxy for some of those top line assumptions that we have in the back part of the year. The consistency of traffic for the year across the months of the quarter, I think that's the thing that we look at really closely that gives us a lot of evidence that even as shopping habits have changed and category trends have changed, we've seen a consistent draw to more and more shoppers shop in our stores and shopping us online. And that consistency of traffic is the thing that gives me lot of optimism as I look to the back half of the year even if we can't sit here today and predict every twist and turn. Yes. You -- as I said in my remarks, I expect to -- we sit here today, expecting a fourth quarter, it looks more like the fourth quarter we've seen in the last couple of years. And so I think that's a 6.8% last year and a 6.5% the year before that. That's the right range around which we set our expectations for the fourth quarter. And obviously, to get to a 6% in total, that implies a lower number in the third quarter. And the driver there is, like I talked about in remarks, some of the costs of our inventory actions do spill over into the third quarter. And we'll continue to manage the elevated fuel and freight costs and kind of how those net against pricing action and things like that over the balance of the year. But we feel good about that range, around 6%, and we'll continue to watch the macro environment really closely. Thanks for the question, Steph. I mean we always know as we get to the back half of the year, it's a promotional environment. The holidays always are, and so we factored that in accordingly. And we see a consumer in the current inflationary environment that's focused on value. And like we've said many times in these calls, we think about pricing first through the lens of our guests. We want to make sure the guests can find great value on shelf, online and the way that we're priced and we feel good about where we've struck that value equation. And I think the traffic we're seeing speaks to the fact that guests see it, too. Sure, Michael. Thanks for the question. While the kind of counterfactual with every elasticity of where Q2 would have landed, it is a little bit of more art than science. We think that the net dollar impact of our markdowns is probably negligible all in, in the second quarter. And of course, we took some markdowns to move through some product, but we think that probably net-net, that didn't move our top line comp a lot. \n As we think about the back half of the year, we're informing the back half based on the trends that we're seeing now in the business. And as we've talked about, some of those trends that we saw change at the end of Q1, we've seen persist into Q2, and we factored that in to our thinking for the back half of the year. We'll continue to be mindful of what's clearly in an uncertain environment for the economy and the consumer. And to the point Christina made earlier in Q&A, we'll stay close to those trends, and we'll adjust accordingly. And that's why taking the inventory actions we did to give us some room to operate and to give us some flexibility in the system will be important in an uncertain environment. Yes. I mean there's probably a piece in each bucket, Simeon. As we've grown the business, obviously, we invest more labor in moving the product to support that growth, and that's a piece of some of that growth there. And then it also costs us more when we're full. And our supply chain was full in the second quarter. And so there's a piece of that, that will result in improved productivity over time as we get some of that inventory out of the system. To Brian's point, we'll come back and unpack next year when the time is right to do that. But I expect to see both of those drivers present as we do so. Yes. We aren't breaking out a specific assumption for mix. But I think if you look over the last couple of quarters, you see mix isn't a big driver of our margin results. And so I wouldn't think about it markedly any differently as we project ahead. I'll maybe start at the end of your question. We expect Q4 to be promotional.  It always is. And our plans plan for promotions that will provide great value to our guests and those seasonal moments that matter. That's been true in every Q4 in my 18 years here, and I expect it not to be any different this time around. \n With respect to unpacking the margin, I'll go back to some of what I said in my comments. And we were, year-over-year, 9 percentage points down,  7 of that is mostly driven by inventory actions and you see incremental markdowns as a piece of that. You also see the cost of some of those receipt cancellations that John talked about earlier. And then you see about 1.5 points of pressure from supply chain and digital. And a piece of that is related to us being heavier in the system and that drives some costs. A piece of that is the elevated freight and transportation rates that we've talked about previously, that will continue to kind of maybe move up and move down based on the day, are definitely elevated versus any historical measure. And you can see over that --  see that is a piece of that year-over-year pressure, too. Yes. I mean we've seen persistent cost inflation in food. And I think across the industry, you've seen price move with that. That's been no different here at Target. We are really mindful of making sure that we feel good about our price gaps, definitely do today in food. \n And if you zoom out from the food-specific piece of that, again, I'll come back to traffic. If you look at what drove our growth in the second quarter, there were some puts and takes within basket between ASP and units. But the story was traffic. And so again, that gives us evidence that we're getting that value equation right for our guests. I think that's generally in the right ballpark. Obviously, there's some mix implications there if you're comparing retailer to retailer. But we've seen persistently high inflation in food. And I think that's a trend that's been with us for a while, and we don't expect it to change anytime soon. And then, Oliver, kind of what's in some of the Q4 actions we still have to take, just to provide kind of an example there. If there's seasonal product, it's a natural time to leave our store within Q3, and we'll continue to work through some of that inventory then. And so that's an example of some of the work still to be done. But kind of in where we started, we feel really good about our inventory position as we exit the second quarter. And we accomplished what we set out to do from an inventory perspective."

[Operator Instructions] \n As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 18, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. \n On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our first quarter performance and our outlook and priorities for the second quarter and beyond. Following the remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his perspective on our outlook. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the underlying strength of the relationship we've built with our guests at a time when our team is working through multiple cost pressures affecting our business. As expected, our business continued to grow in the first quarter, on top of huge gains a year ago, underlying the resilience of both the consumer and the ability of our team to serve them. However, due to a host of factors, this growth was challenged by unusually high costs, resulting in profitability well below what we expected to be and where we expect to operate over time. \n First quarter comparable sales grew by 3.3%, on top of 23% growth a year ago. This marked our 20th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases. 11 of those quarters were before the pandemic, followed by the rapid acceleration we saw in 2020. We're also encouraged that traffic continues to fuel our growth, increasing nearly 4% in the quarter, on top of 17% growth a year ago. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate was well below our expectations, reflecting a combination of factors that prove to be very different than expected, driven by a rapidly shifting macro backdrop and changing consumer behavior. More specifically, we saw much higher-than-expected rate and transportation costs and a more dramatic change in our sales mix than we anticipated. This resulted in excess inventory, much of it in bulky categories, which put additional strain on an already stretched supply chain. Christina, John and Michael will share more details shortly. \n And while we have a lot of work ahead of us to restore profitability to the level where we expect to operate over time, I want to thank the team for maintaining their laser focus on the guest experience. We've spent years growing Target's relationship with our guests, which is fueling the traffic and sales growth we're seeing today. In sustaining that guest focus, we're confident we'll see deeper loyalty and profitable sales growth in the years ahead. \n On our sales channels, first quarter comps were balanced between store and digital as each increased a little more than 3%. Within our digital channel, growth continues to be led by our same-day services and Drive-Up in particular which delivered growth in the mid-teens this year on top of more than 100% growth a year ago. \n Since Q1 of 2019, prior to the pandemic, first quarter sales have grown more than 40% or just over $7.4 billion. Broken down by channel, store sales accounted for about $4.1 billion of this increase, while digital sales grew another $3.3 billion, having expanded by more than 250% over that time. \n From a category perspective, we continue to benefit from our balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to flexibly serve our guests as their wants and needs change. More specifically, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong growth and market share gains in food and beverage and essential categories. We also benefited from double-digit comp growth in Beauty, reflecting our ongoing work to enhance presentation, assortment and service, including our new and expanding partnership with Ulta Beauty. The result of this partnership have exceeded our initial expectations, driving higher productivity and sales in both Beauty [ area ], and adjacent categories in the store, where we've added an Ulta Beauty experience. \n In our other 3 core merchandise categories: Apparel, Home and Hardlines, we saw a rapid slowdown in the year-over-year sales trend beginning of March, when we began to annualize the impact of last year's stimulus payments. While we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown in these categories and we expect the consumer to continue refocusing their spending away from goods and into services, we didn't anticipate the magnitude of that shift. \n As I mentioned earlier, this led us to carry too much inventory, particularly in bulky categories, including kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture. And with very little slack capacity after 2 years of unprecedented growth, we faced elevated cost to store and had begun rightsizing our inventory position. \n Nevertheless, we're still seeing healthy overall spending by our guests, even as their spending continues to evolve. Notably, we continue to see meaningful spending surges around holidays, including Easter in April and Mother's Day a couple of weeks ago. \n Also notable, in comparing this year's weekly sales of pre-pandemic levels at the beginning of 2019, we're actually seeing stronger 3-year growth trends in recent weeks compared with the beginning of the first quarter, even in categories where we saw a rapid slowdown on a 1-year basis. These encouraging longer-term growth trends demonstrate the continued resilience of the American consumer and the trust they place in Target even if they face multiple challenges. \n Not surprising, when we talk to our guests, they often express their concerns about a host of rapidly changing conditions, ranging from geopolitics to the high and persistent inflation they've been experiencing, particularly in food and energy. At the same time, guests are focused on getting back to many of the habits and behaviors they suspended during the heart of the pandemic, including travel, out-of-home activities and social gatherings. And importantly, even as the mix of what they're buying continues to evolve, their spending capacity continues to benefit from elevated saving rates, high employment and healthy wage growth. \n So as we continually adapt our offering to best serve our guests in a rapidly changing environment, today, we're focused more than ever on providing value across our multi-category assortment, presenting options that are affordable and accessible to a broad and diverse base of guests across a wide range of household incomes. And even as we face multiple cost pressures, our team is working tirelessly to maintain prices wherever possible. \n But of course, while it's always the last lever we pull, external conditions led us to raise prices across a broad set of items in multiple categories. But as you've clearly seen in recent quarters, overall costs have been rising much faster than retail prices, resulting in year-over-year declines in our gross margin rates. While we're not happy about the near-term pressure this causes on the profit line, we strongly believe these decisions will benefit our business over time. \n And as we currently monitor our prices and quality stack up versus the competition, our guests are telling us they appreciate the value and experience we're providing. More importantly, our guests are showing appreciation, with more footsteps in our stores and more clicks on our site, resulting in continued traffic and sales growth on top of record growth a year ago. \n As we look ahead, we'll maintain this focus on value, helping them to save time and money in a rapidly evolving environment. For those who are focused on driving pure miles in response to record high gas prices, our broadened unit merchandise assortment, combined with our low prices, offers a smart way to save time and miles by consolidating shopping trips. \n Of course, for guests who are looking for money-saving options when they're shopping for their families, our $30 billion portfolio of home brands offer outstanding quality and savings across every one of our merchandising categories. And because saving time is valuable in any environment, we're continuing to invest in expanding the scope of our reliable and convenient same-day services, including our Drive-Up and in-store pickup services, which we offer our guests at no charge. \n Just as we designed our merchandise portfolio to flexibly serve our guests, our operations have managed through extreme volatility over the last few years. Rapid growth amounting to tens of billions of dollars, combined with unprecedented shift in demand across categories, channels and services, has created a host of challenges for our team, which they've handled with incredible energy and focus. And while we entered this year hopeful that volatility will begin to moderate, we've experienced the extreme opposite in Q1, and we don't see current conditions improving right away. \n In the face of this volatility, our team continues to focus on the guest experience, working to ensure that anything our team is handling behind the scenes doesn't what our guests see and feel. So as we look ahead, it is clear that many of these pressures will persist in future quarters, but that hasn't affected our long-term plans and expectations, including our confidence in the ability of our business to grow mid-single digits and maintain an operating margin of 8% or higher over time. \n In the meantime, even as we navigate to restore profitability from the impact of these short-term challenges, we're continuing to invest in project design to deliver continued profitable long-term growth. Our business model and team have proven their ability to successfully navigate through extreme volatility. And we're confident our business will emerge even stronger from these challenges we're facing today. Just as our investments in early 2017 were followed by profitable growth in later years, we're confident the decisions we're making today, combined with our investments in future growth, will pay off handsomely over time. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. \n Just a few months ago, at our Financial Community Meeting, my presentation outlined our strategic vision as a company. While I covered many facets of our strategy that day, where I started then is where I want to start again today, with our guests. We frequently get questions about how our guests are feeling given the current economic environment, how their shopping habits are evolving and what's top of mind for them. \n Our guest base encompasses every slice of the American population given that we serve nearly 20 million guests on average each and every week. And the breadth of their individual decisions as they navigate a rapidly changing macro environment is just as broad, making the answers to those questions that much more complex.\n A guest might be telling us that they're worried about inflation and rising gas prices. But they're also looking to splurge on new shoes or some accent pillows for their home. Another guest remains worried about COVID, but they're still planning to resume travel and looking forward to summer outings like Little League games and barbecues with friends. Many guests are sharing their uncertainty of the overall state of the economy, but are feeling more positive about their personal finances. With so much on their minds and a wide array of wants and needs, it has never been more important for Target to be flexible and provide ease, safety, inspiration and solutions for all of our guests. \n In the first quarter, we invested in delivering a great guest experience to build and maintain the trust and love for the Target brand. And those decisions came with substantial costs. I'll share more on this shortly. Our first quarter results reinforce the power of our multi-category portfolio, which allows us to lean into those ever-changing wants and needs. \n More and more, we are seeing our guests increasing mobility and love of newness play out in their Target purchases as baskets shift more toward experiences and going-out categories. This includes notable strength in fashion forward apparel, prepaid cards, toys and travel. While apparel basics moderated in the quarter, trend-based apparel accelerated meaningfully as increasingly, people are returning to the office or dining out with friends. We're also seeing robust growth in Beauty, driven by particular strength in going-out categories like sunscreen, color cosmetics and fragrance. Luggage grew more than 50% as the world continues to reopen, and we reunite with the places and people we have missed visiting. \n And our owned brand portfolio continues to grow faster than total sales, as it has quarter-after-quarter for years now. We continuously benefit from the growing guest affinity for our owned brands, which are designed to drive trips to Target, not simply to provide another option when guests are already in a store. Our guests appreciate the value, quality and great design they have come to expect and love from Target owned brands, even as they continue to appreciate our national brand options and partnerships as well. \n As Brian outlined, our team delivered just over 3% in comparable sales growth in the first quarter, in line with expectations, reflecting strong traffic and unit share gains. First quarter growth was strongest in frequently purchased categories, including Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials. \n Food & Beverage, which delivered low double-digit growth this quarter was strong across the entire assortment. Over the last 3 years, first quarter Food & Beverage sales have increased by nearly $1.8 billion, accounting for nearly 1/4 of our total sales growth over that time. Market share gains in this category are being driven by unit share growth, most notably in our owned brand offerings, as more of our guests turn to Good & Gather and Favorite Day for their meal solutions. \n Beauty has been one of our fastest-growing categories for years now and grew again in the low double digits in Q1 as guests spend more time outside of the home and want to look and feel their best. Since the first quarter of 2019, Beauty sales have expanded by more than 45%, the mass majority of which occurred before our rollout of the Ulta Beauty at Target experience, evidence that there is still plenty of room for growth in this category. \n Essentials grew in the high single digits in Q1, having added well over $1 billion in first quarter sales over the last 3 years. Notably, nearly $0.5 billion of that growth happened after 2020, when we saw explosive demand for categories like household paper, over-the-counter and cleaning supplies.\n Across our other core categories: Apparel, Home and Hardlines, we saw small declines in comparable sales this quarter. In Apparel, despite unfavorable weather across most of the country, comp sales remained nearly flat to last year, having grown more than 60% in the first quarter a year ago and nearly $1 billion since the first quarter of 2019. \n In Home, even after a small pullback in Q1 comps, sales remain more than 40% higher than the first quarter of 2019, equating to more than $1.2 billion in growth over that time. Our seasonal categories continue to excel as our guests turn to Target for all of their holiday and celebratory solutions, leading to all-time records in the recent Valentine's Day and Easter seasons. \n And notably, guests are finding new ways to enjoy and celebrate the spaces they've invested in over the past few years. Having already renovated their homes with purchases in categories like furniture and small appliances, guests are now refreshing their homes with smaller touches, driving demand in categories like decor, candles and seasonal assortments; further evidence, not just of the strength in our multi-category portfolio, but the breadth of what we offer within categories as well. \n Hardlines saw a slight pullback in Q1, but has grown more than $1.3 billion since the first quarter of 2019. Within Hardlines, guests have been refocusing their spending away from electronics like TVs and into experiences for both kids and adults, which led to strength in our toys, travel and prepaid card categories. \n As Brian mentioned, first quarter gross margin performance was well below our expectations. This was driven by a number of factors, the most impactful of which was softer than expected sales in several categories, resulting in too much inventory in those areas. As we developed our plans for the quarter, our task was to anticipate how spending would change under circumstances no one had ever seen before given that we were about to compare over 2 years of historically high federal stimulus payments. As such, we relied on numerous forecasts and estimate, both internal and external, to help determine our view for the quarter. Despite this careful approach, the mix of actual demand materialized differently than we had anticipated. \n In addition, as supply grew and demand shifted away from bigger, bulkier products like furniture, TVs and more, we needed to make difficult trade-off decisions. We could keep this product knowing it would sell over time or we can make room for fast-growing categories like Food & Beverage, Beauty, and personal care and Household Essentials. To preserve the quality of on-shelf presentations and support the guest experience, we chose the latter, leading to incremental markdowns that reduced our gross margin. While these were difficult decisions, we believe they'll pay off in the long term, given that building long-term loyalty remains our top priority. \n As we look ahead, we'll continue to do all we can to support our guests, providing them great value, an unbeatable selection of necessities and affordable luxuries and a shopping experience that sparks a smile and provides a temporary escape. The second quarter offers many opportunities for our team to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. And this summer's assortment features some of our most inclusive offerings yet. \n First, in May, we are celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month by highlighting Asian founders and creators, amplifying their voices with stories of how their unique cultures influence the creation of their products and businesses. With June right around the corner, we're excited to honor our LGBTQ+ community as we celebrate Pride Month. This uplifting and always relevant assortment offers bold product, inclusive marketing and everyday affirmation that authentically represents and celebrates community and culture. And of course, we just finished celebrating mom in May and have plenty of options to honor dads in June, along with many other opportunities to celebrate the joys of summer. \n And speaking of joy, we're ecstatic about our recently announced expanded partnership with actress, author and social media phenomenon, Tabitha Brown, a beacon of positivity, inspiration and joy. Having collaborated with her on social media for years, we're excited to grow our partnership with Tabitha and feature 4 limited time-only collections set to launch over the next year, starting with an exclusive apparel and accessories line of more than 75 items this June that are sure to lift both style and spirit. \n Before I pass things over to John, I want to thank our teams across stores, distribution centers and headquarters locations all around the globe for their unwavering leadership and service to our guests and to each other. Without them, we would not be able to continue growing our business and serving our guests each and every day. Despite the volatility and rapid shifts in consumer demand, the macro environment and the global supply chain, our business remains strong, and we're confident in both our long-term strategy and our team's ability to navigate through this dynamic period. \n We continue to focus on serving our guests in all that we do through our ability to provide relevance and joy in our assortment, the delivery of a positive one-of-a-kind inspiring guest experience and by building lasting, deepened affinity over time. We're lucky to have the best team in retail to make all of this come to life, and I look forward to all we will do together in the second quarter and beyond. \n With that, I'll pass things over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. Over the last couple of years, our team has been focused on 2 separate and related issues, namely, beginning with the acceleration in sales in early 2020, our inventory wasn't growing fast enough to keep up with the expansion of our sales volume. And as a result, we weren't maintaining in-stock levels consistent with our standards. \n Following 2 years of effort to catch up, by the time we entered 2022, we had made considerable progress. Overall inventory levels were aligned with both the level of sales we had already achieved and our near-term growth expectations. As a result, we began to see improvements in both in-stocks and product availability. However, conditions have remained far from perfect. Some items and categories remained spotty, typically driven by vendors who are facing multiple constraints in their businesses. \n A separate challenge our team has been facing, which became more acute in the back half of 2021, is driven by capacity constraints in both the global and domestic freight markets. These issues continue to make it more difficult and more expensive to move inventory where we need it to be. Our team has done a great job managing through these challenges. And as you've seen from our recent gross margin results, our P&L has reflected those higher freight costs. \n Coming into this year, we anticipated we'd see continued tight conditions and elevated costs in freight markets. But the actual conditions and costs have been much more challenging than expected. More specifically, first quarter freight and transportation costs came in hundreds of millions of dollars higher than our already elevated expectations. And for the full year, we're now expecting about $1 billion of incremental freight costs, even compared to our expectations only 3 months ago. \n Among the reasons for this incremental pressure, record high fuel costs are a meaningful driver as well as the global shipping market, where costs have stayed unusually high and where we sometimes need to rely on the spot market to secure adequate capacity. Compounding these near-term pressures on our gross margin rate, volatility in both consumer demand and delivery times placed additional stress on our supply chain in Q1, one that was already running lean on capacity in light of the growth we've seen over the last 2 years.\n As Brian and Christina mentioned, this quarter, we ended up carrying too much inventory in several categories where the slowdown in sales was more pronounced than expected, including home, electronics, sporting goods and apparel. In addition, capacity pressures were compounded by the fact that in several of these categories, including kitchen appliances, furniture and outdoor living, items are bulkier than average and require higher-than-average amounts of storage capacity. \n As our team collaborated with Christina's team to work through this excess inventory, we made decisions with an eye on preserving the guest experience. Rather than jamming store sales floors with excess product, which would have made them more difficult to shop, our team secured temporary storage capacity instead. And as Christina mentioned, rather than carrying items beyond their relevant season, her team made the tougher call and marked items down to clear them and keep our presentations fresh and inspiring. \n While these were difficult decisions in the moment, we have no doubt they are the right long-term choices. However, they involved higher costs, resulting directly from the actions we chose to take and indirectly in terms of team member hours required to manage the extra volume. As Michael will discuss in more detail, while we don't expect these conditions to persist over time, they'll continue to impact our Q2 results before conditions begin improving later in the year. \n More specifically, as we move beyond the front half of the year, we'll have had enough time to adjust inventory levels and receipt volumes to match the pace of sales, even in longer lead time categories. In addition, capacity in our supply chain will continue to build throughout the year as the new buildings we opened last fall continue to ramp up their productivity while we work to open additional buildings in the years ahead. \n Beyond this ongoing work to expand the upstream supply chain, we continue to add downstream capacity in our sortation centers, which increased speed and reduced the unit cost of last mile delivery. Following our successful test of the concept in the Minneapolis market, we now have 6 sortation centers open and operating, with plans to open 3 more by the end of the year. \n While the newly opened centers are still ramping up their capacity, in total, our 6 sortation centers handled 4.5 million packages in Q1, a number that's expected to grow significantly throughout the year. Each of these facilities already has volume flowing to our national carrier partners, including the ability to sort USPS packages individually by post office, creating a high-speed, low-cost delivery option in the metro areas surrounding each center. \n In addition, we've begun rolling out our lowest cost delivery option, Target last-mile delivery, at our Atlanta sortation center and will soon expand that capability to the other 4 recently opened facilities. For this capability, we collaborate with our partners at Shipt, whose drivers sign up to deliver batches of orders that have been sorted hyperlocally down to the neighborhood level. This provides a fast, efficient, reliable and low-cost delivery option for our business, benefiting both our guests and the P&L. While we're excited about the results these centers are already delivering, this initiative is in the very early stages, and we have plans to continue opening centers and ramping up this new capability for years to come. \n Beyond investments in the supply chain, we're also excited about the investments we're making in our stores, allowing them to become more productive, more fun and more inspiring to shop. For the year, we have plans to complete remodel projects in nearly 400 stores. And through the first quarter, we had already mobilized on just under half of those projects, keeping us on pace for the year. Just under 200 of this year's projects will be traditional full remodels in which we transform every part of the store, from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, updating the shopping experience to make it more inspiring for our guests and more efficient for our team to operate. \n Beyond those full remodels, we're planning to complete just over 200 fulfillment remodels in 2022 as well. These projects are focused on the operations of the store and their ability to support our same-day services. More specifically, these projects make changes within the 4 walls of the store to add capacity for same-day orders and incorporate features to enhance our pickup and Drive-Up capabilities. \n When warranted, these remodels include the addition of walk-in coolers and freezers near the front of the store, adding reliable capacity for our team to fulfill fresh, refrigerated and frozen items through our pickup and Drive-Up services. In addition, with many of these projects, we had a dedicated door for our team members to use when delivering Drive-Up orders to the parking lot. We're also adding canopies, more prominent signing and more Drive-Up spaces in our parking lots, making the Drive-Up process safer and easier for both our team members and our guests. \n Beyond these existing store investments, we continue to open new stores around the country. In the first quarter, we opened 7 locations, all smaller formats, in markets ranging from Jackson Hole in Wyoming to Times Square in New York. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores and our ability to flexibly serve guests in new neighborhoods. And for our stores and markets that were temporarily affected by COVID, including college locations, tourist destinations and dense urban areas, we've seen continued rapid recovery in sales volumes as activity ramps up in those markets following periods of lockdown over the last 2 years. \n Similar to the pressures we've been experiencing in our merchandise costs, our construction team has been dealing with volatility in the price of raw materials and labor in our new store and remodel projects. And like our merchandising partners, they've done a great job working around those costs and constraints, keeping projects on track while maintaining their focus on delivering a great guest experience. \n So as I get ready to hand the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank the entire operations team, from our stores, to supply chain, and our properties team to our partners at Shipt. The growth we've seen in our business and the expansion of our capabilities over the last 2 years has been both energizing and inspiring, but it certainly hasn't been easy for our team. They've handled growth well beyond what any of us would have expected 2 years ago, even as they worked around new challenges and unexpected obstacles. \n One of the joys of the last year has been the ability for me to once again get out in the field, traveling to our stores and distribution facilities around the country, and experiencing firsthand the energy and positive attitude our team brings to work. They're united in their support of our guests, for our brand and for each other. Every day, they bring our company purpose to life. And every day, I am inspired by what they accomplish. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. I want to start my remarks today where John just ended and add my thanks to our entire team. Even with all of the challenges they've been facing, they refused to get distracted. Instead, they maintained their focus on our company purpose, to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Our team shows up to work every day with a passion for serving all families and for serving each other. \n As John mentioned, it's been a joy in recent months to be able to travel once again, meet with teams across the country and hear what's on their minds. And the optimism and energy of our team is infectious. I can feel that whenever I meet with the team, and obviously, our guests can feel it when they shop, which explains why our first quarter traffic has increased more than 20% over the last 2 years. \n In the first quarter, our comp increase of 3.3% was supported by a traffic increase of 3.9%, partially offset by a small decrease in average ticket. Among our fulfillment channels, store sales grew slightly faster than digital in the quarter. Within digital, same-day services continue to drive our growth, and accounted for well over half of our first quarter digital sales; within our same-day services, Drive-Up accounts for the majority of sales, and it continues to grow the fastest. In fact, of the $3.3 billion in first quarter digital sales that we've added since 2019, Drive-Up accounts for nearly half of that growth. \n On the first quarter gross margin line, we saw a rate decline of about 4.3 percentage points compared with last year. Among the causal factors, merchandising actions drove about 3 percentage points of the decline, driven by the combined impact of impairments, markdowns and other actions taken to rightsize our inventory position in categories that were too heavy, along with the impact of higher freight costs. \n Among other drivers, higher supply chain costs accounted for a little over one percentage point of this year's rate decline, reflecting the impact of higher headcount and compensation in our distribution centers. Sales mix accounted for the remainder of the decline, worth about 10 basis points of pressure. \n On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from fixed cost leverage and strong expense control throughout the quarter, which helped to offset the impact of inflation-driven cost increases in multiple expense lines. Within compensation, the continued impact of team investments was offset by lower incentive compensation compared with last year. \n On the D&A expense line, we saw about 10 basis points of benefit in Q1, reflecting leverage on strong revenue growth. Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate of 5.3% was about 4.5 percentage points lower than last year. While we expected this year's rate would be well below last year, our actual performance in the quarter was far lower than we anticipated, driven by the unexpectedly high costs we incurred on the gross margin line. \n Turning now to capital deployment, I'll start where I always do, by reiterating our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. First, we fully invest in our business and projects that support our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and look to build on our 50-year record of annual dividend growth. And finally, we return any remaining excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time. \n Beginning with the top priority, first quarter CapEx was just under $1 billion, keeping us on track to spend $4 billion to $5 billion for the year. While our teams continue to face multiple challenges, including supply shortages, shipping delays and permitting and inspection delays in some communities, they're doing a great job of working around these obstacles and keeping projects moving. \n In addition, as John mentioned, unexpected inflationary pressures are affecting some of our capital projects, which will impact our total spending for the year. As I mentioned at our recent Financial Community Meeting, we're excited to make progress on our capital projects, which continue to move our business forward. And today, given the team's efforts to advance this year's projects, I believe we'll reach the high end of our $4 billion to $5 billion plan for the year. \n Moving to our second priority. We paid dividends of $424 million in the first quarter, up about 25% from last year. reflecting a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. We plan to recommend that our Board approve a healthy increase in the quarterly dividend, in the mid-teens to low 20% range later this year, keeping 2022 on track to be our 51st consecutive year of annual dividend increases. \n And finally, regarding share repurchases. Given our strong leverage metrics coming into the year, we entered into an accelerated repurchase plan in the first quarter, which will result in the retirement of up to $2.75 billion of our stock by the time the plan settles in June. In addition to this ASR, we repurchased another $10 million in shares in the first quarter. \n While we anticipate having continued ample capacity to return capital through share repurchases this year, given the current supply chain challenges we're facing and their impact on working capital, we now expect our total repurchases this year will be lower than the $7 billion we returned in 2021. As always, we'll adjust our pace, up or down, based on external conditions, business performance and cash flow, with a goal of maintaining our middle A credit ratings. \n So now I want to turn to our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures both our profitability and the efficiency of our CapEx decisions over time. In the first quarter, we reported a trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC of 25.3%. While this is a very strong number, indicative of the underlying health of our business, it was much lower than expected, near the very low end of where we expect to operate over time. \n Now let's turn to our guidance. In terms of the top line, based on our first quarter results and the trends we've seen so far in May, we continue to expect full year revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. In terms of our profitability, given the unexpected cost headwinds that we're currently facing, we now believe our full year operating margin rate will be well below our prior guidance of 8% or higher. More specifically, given the elevated level of volatility we're currently facing and multiple sources of uncertainty going forward, we see a range of potential outcomes, centered around a 6% operating margin rate for the full year. \n As John mentioned, in the second quarter, we expect the challenges we faced in the first quarter will continue to impact our near-term profit performance. And our team is focused on doing everything necessary to ensure we enter the fall season with an appropriate level of inventory by category. As such, we expect a Q2 operating margin rate in a wide range, centered around our first quarter rate to 5.3%, well below where we'd expect to operate under normal conditions. \n As we move into the back half of the year, we continue to expect our profit performance will begin to improve. In particular, as John mentioned, we expect to have worked through the excess inventory positions that hampered our Q1 performance and which we expect to impact our gross margin in Q2. That said, we don't expect the external environment will be anything close to normal in the back half of the year. In particular, we don't expect to see any meaningful reduction in global supply chain pressures until 2023 at the earliest. So the elevated costs we've been facing will continue to affect our profitability for the remainder of the year. \n But let me be clear about a couple of things. First, we are not happy with our current profit performance, and our team is laser-focused on helping to quickly restore our business performance to where it should be operating over time. That said, nothing that is happening today has changed our long-run expectations regarding the ability of our business to grow nor has it changed our view of the long-run potential of our business to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher over time. \n And today, as we navigate these near-term challenges, we are fortunate to have an incredibly healthy underlying business, one that can stand up to the significant headwinds we're facing and come out stronger on the other side. We have ample financial capacity to continue making long-term investments, in new stores, remodels, supply chain, and of course, in our team, all with a focus on serving and delighting our guests, driving deeper loyalty, and building on the top line growth we've seen in recent years and which continues today. \n After all, even after a significant pullback from last year, first quarter earnings per share were more than 40% higher than in the first quarter of 2019 prior to the beginning of the pandemic. While that doesn't mean we're where we want to be operating today, it shows we have a strong foundation from which we can recover from today's challenging environment and restore our operating margins to 8% or higher over time, consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. And given the loyalty and momentum we've established with our guests and the power of the investments we continue to make, we expect to continue growing the top line, even as we regain the level of profitability we expect our business will generate over time. \n Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to take a few minutes to reinforce why we're confident in the ability of our team and our durable business model to successfully navigate today's volatile environment and deliver continued profitable market share growth in the years ahead. \n As Michael covered, even as elevated costs put meaningful pressure on our near-term financial performance, our business today remains profitable and very healthy, and it continues to grow. Since the first quarter of 2019, both our revenue on the top line and our EPS on the bottom line have each grown by more than 40%. Underlying that growth, we benefited from strong increases in both guest traffic and average ticket over the last 3 years, meaning the guests have found more reasons to visit our stores and our site and purchase more when they shop. This is the definition of a durable business model, one that can stand up to the unexpected pressures and remain healthy and growing. \n When I think about the critical drivers of our long-term success, there are 2 things that rise to the top of that list: our team; and the relationship we've developed with our guests. And when I think about the quality of our team, I don't believe that it's ever been better. \n Over the last 5 years, we've made significant, purposeful investments to ensure we're hiring, elevating and retaining the best team in retail. These investments begin with paying benefits. But we've also found new ways to enhance the work experience and provide pathways for advancements, all in keeping with our Target forward goals to create an equitable and inclusive workforce and workplace. So even as we work tirelessly to restore our business to its long-term profitability, you should expect us to continue investing in our team, because we'll never achieve our longer potential without them. \n We have the same perspective regarding relationships with our guests. Over the last 5 years, we've made a number of deliberate decisions that were designed to deepen the relationship between Target and our guests. These decisions have resulted in ever-increasing traffic, translating to growth on both the top line and the bottom. \n So in the quarter just ended, when our team was facing potential trade-offs between a guest experience and incurring short-term costs, I am proud to say that they maintained their focus on the guest experience. That's because our team is laser-focused on our long-term financial performance, which depends on building and maintaining an ever-deepening relationships with our guests. \n So with that, I want to thank you for listening into our call today. And now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: I have a question and as well as a follow-up. So first question is, in the first quarter of 2020, you took a large inventory impairment that you were able to get back in the second quarter. Now understanding it's a different environment that we face in this quarter, but the question is, how much lingering markdown risk could there be in 2Q? Maybe how large was the impairment? And why wouldn't this capture the risk in the first quarter? And how are you framing out the potential gross margin decline in 2Q? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. We still got some inventory to work through. And so you saw some of that pain in Q1. And our gross margin guidance of Q2 of operating -- or sorry, our operating margin guidance of a 5.3%, give or take, a wide range around that, contemplates the work we still think we have to do on the inventory side in the second quarter. Importantly, we believe taking those actions in Q1 and Q2 set us up well for the balance of the year. We've got some big important seasons in front of us: back to school, back to college. It will be fall and holiday before we know it, and so we're taking the right actions now to preserve a guest experience that continues to be strong. You saw it in traffic in Q1, and we're excited about what we see as a start of Q2 on the top line as well. \nChristopher Horvers: Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you expand a little bit more on what changed in your implied operating margin outlook for the back half? You mentioned supply chain costs. Are these now about $1 billion for the year? Are these now big enough to offset the air freight pressures in the back half, particularly 3Q? And then did you also change your mix assumption? And to what extent are you baking in more promotions and clearance relative to a few months ago? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. You hit on 2 of the bigger factors that will be at play in the back half of the year. As we've discussed, we see about $1 billion of freight and transportation pressure, outside of what we would describe even at the start of Q1. But we do expect, and we continue to take product in early intentionally to protect against supply chain disruption. We expect to see some offset as we don't anniversary the same level of air freight that we saw in the back half of the year. \n When it comes to mix, I mentioned in my remarks about a 10 basis point drag from margin rate mix. The biggest shift from a category perspective is just the change in some of the categories at the top of the guest shopping list. And some of those categories where we've got some inventory to work through are the ones we'll work through in the first half of the year, and will be better positioned heading into the second half. \nOperator: The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. \nKaren Short: I had 2 questions. So the first is, I'm just curious on your philosophy with respect to the fact that you had an Analyst Day on March 1 and had some insight into the trends that you were seeing. So can you maybe just update us on your philosophy on maybe giving a pre-announcement? Because, I mean, I think it did come up with Walmart yesterday as well. So you're in good camp on things changing very quickly with the consumer and with the cost side of the equation. So that's my first question. And then I just had a quick follow-up. \nBrian Cornell: Karen, as we stand in front of you and others in March, we did not anticipate the rapid shifts we've seen over the last 60 days. We did not anticipate that transportation and freight costs would soar the way they have as fuel prices have risen to all-time highs. While we were certainly anticipating the impact of overlapping stimulus and consumer and guest returning to more normal activities, we did not expect to see the dramatic shift in many categories that we've talked about, the shift from categories like TVs to luggage, from small appliances to toys, and guests celebrating, being out with friends. That certainly impacted our business in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue in Q2. And we certainly didn't anticipate the impact that would have on our supply chain costs. \n So things changed rapidly after we stood on stage in New York. We own that. It's what we're adjusting as we build our plans for the balance of the year. And we're committed to improving our operating performance over the second, third and fourth quarter and getting ourselves back on track for a more normalized environment in 2023. \nKaren Short: Okay. And then my second question is, obviously, we -- you have the higher sales productivity. That should be sustainable. So that should also translate into a sustainably higher operating margin structure, right, longer term, which is what you guided to. But that's the biggest question, obviously, that investors are asking today given what you just reported and what your guide reflects. So maybe if you could just give a little more color on why -- and the puts -- not the puts and takes, but the -- I guess, a stair step function to get back to your algorithm on the 8% operating margin. \nMichael Fiddelke: You hit the nail on the head in your question. The sustainability of scale benefits, especially as you've seen in SG&A leverage, that should be sticky, and we would expect it to be sticky. We've got some work to do on the margin line, and Q1 and Q2 outlook reflects that. But as we work through some of that inventory liability, as we let the levers we have to pull react to the current environment, to Brian's note, some of that snuck up on us in the first quarter, and we'll work through some of that over time. But we continue to have a lot of confidence that the long-term run rate of profitability for the business is in the 8% range, give or take. And it's our work to do the hard work to get back to that path. \nBrian Cornell: Karen, just finished my -- one of the things that hasn't changed since we were together in March and gives us great confidence as we go forward is the relationship we have with the guest. While we've certainly seen significant cost pressures since the start of this quarter, the guest continues to reward us with footsteps in our stores and growing traffic, more visits to our site. We feel very good about putting over 3% comps on top of 23% last year. The fact that traffic grew by almost 4% on top of 17% last year gives us great confidence that while we're facing some operating challenges, we've made that invisible for the guests. And we protected the guest experience as they shop our stores and visit our site. \n That gives us tremendous confidence that, that guest will continue to reward us, particularly as we provide great value and affordability during a time of need. So that continues to give us confidence, not in just this year, but in our out-year forecast. \nOperator: The next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I wondered if you could help us understand a little bit more the slightly down average ticket during the quarter. Just given the level of inflation that we did see on the cost side and the prices that you may have passed through, are there any pricing actions here that can help offset some of these margin pressures further? Or can we expect higher prices than what we saw in Q1? \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. Thanks for the question, Kate. As we shared in remarks, the headline story for us is traffic growth. But if you -- as you decompose ticket, we did see a low single digit increase in ASPs, offset by a reduction in units per basket. As you've heard us probably say many times before, a lot goes into that ASP number. It's a little bit product mix, it's a little bit how much inflation is in the environment. And so a little trickier to decompose there, but that's just a little more color on what we saw in the basket. \n We continue to be laser-focused on that traffic number. That's a great indicator for us of how -- what we're doing is resonating with the guests and to continue growing the top line by growing and deepening engagement with Target. That positions us well for the back part of the year, and that positions us to have the top line that we want as we rightsize the profit picture over time. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And with regards to the operating margin guidance, and granted that I know you've kind of anchored it to the 5.8% and it being a wide range around that, is there any way you can dimensionalize how much lower do you think the margin can go or what the bottom of that range might be in your scenario analysis? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. There's -- I mean, obviously, there's a lot of factors at play as we look at Q2 and the balance of the year. I think we used the language, we wouldn't expect it to be normal for the balance of this year. So our best view of those factors is in our Q2 guide of 5.3%, plus or minus, a wide range around that, and in our guide of 6% for the year. \nOperator: The next question is from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. \nScott Mushkin: So I guess the first thing I wanted to talk about a little bit is the inflation that consumers are seeing, particularly in those everyday items like utilities, food. How do you think the consumer is going to react over time? I know people talk about peak inflation, but from our vantage, it probably doesn't occur till maybe late summer. And how concerned are you that consumer demand holds up? \nBrian Cornell: Well, Scott, obviously, we're watching this on almost a daily basis. And while we can't project into the future, I wish I had that crystal ball in front of me, we can tell you what we saw during the quarter and the start of May, where we just continue to see a resilient consumer. Our traffic numbers are up to start the second quarter. They're shopping multiple categories. And they're appreciating both the newness that we're providing, the seasonal relevance in our stores and in our assortment and the value we're providing. And we think that's critically important to our success over time. \n So I'd love to give you an outlook on what's going to happen with the consumer and how do they respond to ongoing inflationary pressure. But I can tell you, the traffic we saw in our stores and the visits in our site in the first quarter, the way that's continuing in May 1 tells us that we've built extraordinary trust over the last couple of years. And we're continuing to be rewarded by a guest and the consumer as we work into the second quarter. \nScott Mushkin: So as a follow-up to that, Brian. I guess when you guys look at your business and the volatility that we're seeing and the potential the consumer could weaken, I know you're not seeing it yet, when do you start getting more aggressive on your costs to take action to maybe bring things down if you see things? How quickly can you move? And when do you start to do that? \nBrian Cornell: Well, Scott, we work each and every day to make sure we're finding efficiency throughout our operation. And certainly, coming out of the first quarter, we are doubling down on finding operating efficiencies and greater effectiveness in the organization. We know we've got to be really agile. And I think it's been one of our strengths over the last few years and certainly pronounced during the pandemic, that we have to be able to respond to a changing environment, whether it's the consumer changes, the economic changes around us. \n And we'll continue to make sure we're focusing on agility, maintaining that relationship with the guests, growing market share even in a volatile environment and making sure we just deepen that relationship with our guests, which we think, long term, along with investing in our team, is the most successful way for us to create value for our shareholders. \nOperator: The next question is from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I think earlier in the scripted remarks, Christina had made a comment that consumers seem more positive about their finances. And I was just curious if you could share a little more color behind that, like what you're seeing or hearing in your survey work. \nA. Hennington: Yes. I'd be happy to, Joe. We have been -- the last couple of years, we have been highly engaged in trying to understand the consumer. We've been through a series of chapters of consumer behavior shifts almost every 2 months for 2-plus years, honestly. And what we're seeing is that the consumer has taken control of their environment more so because the macro environment feels out of control. \n And so despite the fact that they might have worries about inflation, they're in charge. And they're making decisions based on their preferences and what they value, which means going back out, if that's what they want to do, traveling because they've missed it, seeing their friends and family again. And it's about moderating those behavior shifts and accommodating our assortment and our messaging and our relevance based on how those shifts happen. And so it's really important to stay close to the consumer and not expect that past behavior as an indicator of the future. \nJoseph Feldman: Got it. And then just a follow-up again on the gross margin pressure you guys are seeing. Should we assume things gradually improve as the year progresses? Because presumably, you'll be lapping some of that pressure from last year. Prior to this quarter, I mean, historically, you guys have always had a pretty steady gross margin on an annual basis anyway, around 28%. And so is there any reason to think we won't kind of naturally come right back to that as we cycle through these pressures? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. You're certainly pointing in the right direction there, Joe. We've given the kind of explicit expectations for Q2, but implied in the full year is an improving profitability picture that will come through margin in the balance of the year. To focus on the annual in the long run there is a theme that I've come back to over and over. Quarterly margin is going to have more volatility than one might think. But in the long run, we're pleased with what we see as the potential of the profitability of the business. And we'll be on a path in the back half of this year to take steps in that direction for sure. \nOperator: The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: Yes. Brian, I wanted to ask you about pricing. Beyond the inventory issue, much of the pressure seems cost related in areas like supply chain. Can you talk about the potential to pass these costs through to consumers and the time frame this may occur? I mean we are hearing from probably your biggest competitor, I guess, plans to do this. If there's any hesitation, maybe talk about why. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Joe, we absolutely are looking at this very carefully. And you should expect us to surgically pass along cost where appropriate. But we're also laser-focused on protecting our value position in this environment and making sure we provide great affordability to the guests in a time of need. \n So we'll take a very balanced perspective on that. But I think we've got to start with doing the right thing for our guests and making sure we continue to provide the value that they look for from Target each and every day while we manage the cost environment and determine where and when we can pass along costs selectively. \nEdward Kelly: Okay. And then just a follow-up. Inventory per store is up a lot over 2019 before, pre-pandemic. And a lot has obviously changed, and your sales are a lot higher. But can you talk about where this should be? Maybe quantify the amount of excess that's still sitting in inventory today and where the most work needs to be done. And then what are you doing going forward to adjust things like cancellations? Or is it just really sort of adjusting ordering going forward? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, Ed. The -- it's a good question. There's a few things going on if you look at the level of inventory on our balance sheet. One is we've got some categories where we need to work through some inventories. We've already talked about that piece. There's a little bit of product cost inflation sitting in that number, too. But I will say, given our desire to make sure we're landing some product earlier and protect against supply chain volatility, for the near term here, you should expect kind of that new normal of sales growth to inventory growth to include some working capital investments as we land some of that product sooner to make sure we've got it for the guest. \n And so those are the 3 big factors that we're watching. Obviously, the first of those factors, we'll work to make some progress on here in the second quarter to get us in line with what we expect sales trends to look like for the back part of the year. But old normal might not be the current run rate in the near term as we work to secure product, land it early and avoid some of the disruptions that have caused out of stocks over the last year. \nJohn Mulligan: Yes. And just to pile on a little bit, I think all things being equal, we would say, given how much larger we are, we turn -- everything would turn faster. But I think Michael hit on it, I don't think 2019 is a reasonable compare. Given the, frankly, slowness in the supply chain, lead times are longer. And that means we carry more inventory at any given time because of those lead times. \n And so we aren't where we want to be right now, for sure. Like Michael said, we're lumpy, and we need to work through that, we will. But in general, the increase in turns that we would naturally see being a larger business with more sales is going to be offset by lead times that have increased virtually across every part of the supply chain. \nBrian Cornell: Operator, we have time for one more question today. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: Two quick follow-ups. The first is, if you guys isolate groceries, so Household Essentials and Food & Beverage, how was gross margin in that area of your business versus expectations? Is that seeing similar kind of pressure? \nMichael Fiddelke: We feel good about the gross margin performance in grocery. And just Food & Beverage in general has been such a steady top line grower, share gainer quarter after quarter. And so the strength that we've built in that category, I think, makes the economics in Food & Beverage work in the right direction. We've talked a lot, and I think it's important as we think about consumer looking for value, the strength of the owned brands in Food & Beverage, Good & Gather and Favorite Day and the guest response we've seen to those 2 owned brands has just been incredible. And that's great from a guest preference perspective. It's also good for margin. \nRobert Ohmes: And the ability to cover the cost increases coming through on the national brands has been healthy? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. We're obviously looking at that across all categories and making sure that we're providing great value to our guests in spite of those inflationary cost pressures. No different approach in food and beverage, where we're looking to get that balance right there, too. \nRobert Ohmes: And then just quickly, on the traffic, which is -- was really healthy against -- I think it was plus 17 last year, any sense of new customers versus frequency? \nMichael Fiddelke: So it's always a little bit of a mix of both when we're doing our job, right? But the thing that we come back to when it comes to driving traffic is just driving deeper and deeper engagement. And you've heard us talk in the past with over 100 million Target Circle guests. That's just one more way that we can continue to drive preference in a personalized way and build deeper and deeper engagement with Target over time. \n And you can see that coming through in the traffic results we see, not just in this quarter, but over the past couple of years. And that gives us a lot of optimism that what we're doing is resonating with the guests, and that should bode well for the balance of the year and beyond. \nA. Hennington: Yes, Robbie, and if I could just add 2 cents to that. The breadth of our growth across our guest base was very broad. All income levels, demographic levels, it was broad. And that's because of our commitment to continue to be more and more relevant over time using the tools that Michael talked about, but really our commitment to being consumer-centric. \nBrian Cornell: All right. Operator, with that, we're going to conclude our call today. I really appreciate everyone participating. And we look forward to talking to you soon. So thank you.",

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. Over the last couple of years, our team has been focused on 2 separate and related issues, namely, beginning with the acceleration in sales in early 2020, our inventory wasn't growing fast enough to keep up with the expansion of our sales volume. And as a result, we weren't maintaining in-stock levels consistent with our standards. \n Following 2 years of effort to catch up, by the time we entered 2022, we had made considerable progress. Overall inventory levels were aligned with both the level of sales we had already achieved and our near-term growth expectations. As a result, we began to see improvements in both in-stocks and product availability. However, conditions have remained far from perfect. Some items and categories remained spotty, typically driven by vendors who are facing multiple constraints in their businesses. \n A separate challenge our team has been facing, which became more acute in the back half of 2021, is driven by capacity constraints in both the global and domestic freight markets. These issues continue to make it more difficult and more expensive to move inventory where we need it to be. Our team has done a great job managing through these challenges. And as you've seen from our recent gross margin results, our P&L has reflected those higher freight costs. \n Coming into this year, we anticipated we'd see continued tight conditions and elevated costs in freight markets. But the actual conditions and costs have been much more challenging than expected. More specifically, first quarter freight and transportation costs came in hundreds of millions of dollars higher than our already elevated expectations. And for the full year, we're now expecting about $1 billion of incremental freight costs, even compared to our expectations only 3 months ago. \n Among the reasons for this incremental pressure, record high fuel costs are a meaningful driver as well as the global shipping market, where costs have stayed unusually high and where we sometimes need to rely on the spot market to secure adequate capacity. Compounding these near-term pressures on our gross margin rate, volatility in both consumer demand and delivery times placed additional stress on our supply chain in Q1, one that was already running lean on capacity in light of the growth we've seen over the last 2 years.\n As Brian and Christina mentioned, this quarter, we ended up carrying too much inventory in several categories where the slowdown in sales was more pronounced than expected, including home, electronics, sporting goods and apparel. In addition, capacity pressures were compounded by the fact that in several of these categories, including kitchen appliances, furniture and outdoor living, items are bulkier than average and require higher-than-average amounts of storage capacity. \n As our team collaborated with Christina's team to work through this excess inventory, we made decisions with an eye on preserving the guest experience. Rather than jamming store sales floors with excess product, which would have made them more difficult to shop, our team secured temporary storage capacity instead. And as Christina mentioned, rather than carrying items beyond their relevant season, her team made the tougher call and marked items down to clear them and keep our presentations fresh and inspiring. \n While these were difficult decisions in the moment, we have no doubt they are the right long-term choices. However, they involved higher costs, resulting directly from the actions we chose to take and indirectly in terms of team member hours required to manage the extra volume. As Michael will discuss in more detail, while we don't expect these conditions to persist over time, they'll continue to impact our Q2 results before conditions begin improving later in the year. \n More specifically, as we move beyond the front half of the year, we'll have had enough time to adjust inventory levels and receipt volumes to match the pace of sales, even in longer lead time categories. In addition, capacity in our supply chain will continue to build throughout the year as the new buildings we opened last fall continue to ramp up their productivity while we work to open additional buildings in the years ahead. \n Beyond this ongoing work to expand the upstream supply chain, we continue to add downstream capacity in our sortation centers, which increased speed and reduced the unit cost of last mile delivery. Following our successful test of the concept in the Minneapolis market, we now have 6 sortation centers open and operating, with plans to open 3 more by the end of the year. \n While the newly opened centers are still ramping up their capacity, in total, our 6 sortation centers handled 4.5 million packages in Q1, a number that's expected to grow significantly throughout the year. Each of these facilities already has volume flowing to our national carrier partners, including the ability to sort USPS packages individually by post office, creating a high-speed, low-cost delivery option in the metro areas surrounding each center. \n In addition, we've begun rolling out our lowest cost delivery option, Target last-mile delivery, at our Atlanta sortation center and will soon expand that capability to the other 4 recently opened facilities. For this capability, we collaborate with our partners at Shipt, whose drivers sign up to deliver batches of orders that have been sorted hyperlocally down to the neighborhood level. This provides a fast, efficient, reliable and low-cost delivery option for our business, benefiting both our guests and the P&L. While we're excited about the results these centers are already delivering, this initiative is in the very early stages, and we have plans to continue opening centers and ramping up this new capability for years to come. \n Beyond investments in the supply chain, we're also excited about the investments we're making in our stores, allowing them to become more productive, more fun and more inspiring to shop. For the year, we have plans to complete remodel projects in nearly 400 stores. And through the first quarter, we had already mobilized on just under half of those projects, keeping us on pace for the year. Just under 200 of this year's projects will be traditional full remodels in which we transform every part of the store, from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, updating the shopping experience to make it more inspiring for our guests and more efficient for our team to operate. \n Beyond those full remodels, we're planning to complete just over 200 fulfillment remodels in 2022 as well. These projects are focused on the operations of the store and their ability to support our same-day services. More specifically, these projects make changes within the 4 walls of the store to add capacity for same-day orders and incorporate features to enhance our pickup and Drive-Up capabilities. \n When warranted, these remodels include the addition of walk-in coolers and freezers near the front of the store, adding reliable capacity for our team to fulfill fresh, refrigerated and frozen items through our pickup and Drive-Up services. In addition, with many of these projects, we had a dedicated door for our team members to use when delivering Drive-Up orders to the parking lot. We're also adding canopies, more prominent signing and more Drive-Up spaces in our parking lots, making the Drive-Up process safer and easier for both our team members and our guests. \n Beyond these existing store investments, we continue to open new stores around the country. In the first quarter, we opened 7 locations, all smaller formats, in markets ranging from Jackson Hole in Wyoming to Times Square in New York. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores and our ability to flexibly serve guests in new neighborhoods. And for our stores and markets that were temporarily affected by COVID, including college locations, tourist destinations and dense urban areas, we've seen continued rapid recovery in sales volumes as activity ramps up in those markets following periods of lockdown over the last 2 years. \n Similar to the pressures we've been experiencing in our merchandise costs, our construction team has been dealing with volatility in the price of raw materials and labor in our new store and remodel projects. And like our merchandising partners, they've done a great job working around those costs and constraints, keeping projects on track while maintaining their focus on delivering a great guest experience. \n So as I get ready to hand the call over to Michael, I want to pause and thank the entire operations team, from our stores, to supply chain, and our properties team to our partners at Shipt. The growth we've seen in our business and the expansion of our capabilities over the last 2 years has been both energizing and inspiring, but it certainly hasn't been easy for our team. They've handled growth well beyond what any of us would have expected 2 years ago, even as they worked around new challenges and unexpected obstacles. \n One of the joys of the last year has been the ability for me to once again get out in the field, traveling to our stores and distribution facilities around the country, and experiencing firsthand the energy and positive attitude our team brings to work. They're united in their support of our guests, for our brand and for each other. Every day, they bring our company purpose to life. And every day, I am inspired by what they accomplish. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. Yes. And just to pile on a little bit, I think all things being equal, we would say, given how much larger we are, we turn -- everything would turn faster. But I think Michael hit on it, I don't think 2019 is a reasonable compare. Given the, frankly, slowness in the supply chain, lead times are longer. And that means we carry more inventory at any given time because of those lead times. \n And so we aren't where we want to be right now, for sure. Like Michael said, we're lumpy, and we need to work through that, we will. But in general, the increase in turns that we would naturally see being a larger business with more sales is going to be offset by lead times that have increased virtually across every part of the supply chain."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the underlying strength of the relationship we've built with our guests at a time when our team is working through multiple cost pressures affecting our business. As expected, our business continued to grow in the first quarter, on top of huge gains a year ago, underlying the resilience of both the consumer and the ability of our team to serve them. However, due to a host of factors, this growth was challenged by unusually high costs, resulting in profitability well below what we expected to be and where we expect to operate over time. \n First quarter comparable sales grew by 3.3%, on top of 23% growth a year ago. This marked our 20th consecutive quarter of comparable sales increases. 11 of those quarters were before the pandemic, followed by the rapid acceleration we saw in 2020. We're also encouraged that traffic continues to fuel our growth, increasing nearly 4% in the quarter, on top of 17% growth a year ago. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate was well below our expectations, reflecting a combination of factors that prove to be very different than expected, driven by a rapidly shifting macro backdrop and changing consumer behavior. More specifically, we saw much higher-than-expected rate and transportation costs and a more dramatic change in our sales mix than we anticipated. This resulted in excess inventory, much of it in bulky categories, which put additional strain on an already stretched supply chain. Christina, John and Michael will share more details shortly. \n And while we have a lot of work ahead of us to restore profitability to the level where we expect to operate over time, I want to thank the team for maintaining their laser focus on the guest experience. We've spent years growing Target's relationship with our guests, which is fueling the traffic and sales growth we're seeing today. In sustaining that guest focus, we're confident we'll see deeper loyalty and profitable sales growth in the years ahead. \n On our sales channels, first quarter comps were balanced between store and digital as each increased a little more than 3%. Within our digital channel, growth continues to be led by our same-day services and Drive-Up in particular which delivered growth in the mid-teens this year on top of more than 100% growth a year ago. \n Since Q1 of 2019, prior to the pandemic, first quarter sales have grown more than 40% or just over $7.4 billion. Broken down by channel, store sales accounted for about $4.1 billion of this increase, while digital sales grew another $3.3 billion, having expanded by more than 250% over that time. \n From a category perspective, we continue to benefit from our balanced multi-category portfolio, which allows us to flexibly serve our guests as their wants and needs change. More specifically, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong growth and market share gains in food and beverage and essential categories. We also benefited from double-digit comp growth in Beauty, reflecting our ongoing work to enhance presentation, assortment and service, including our new and expanding partnership with Ulta Beauty. The result of this partnership have exceeded our initial expectations, driving higher productivity and sales in both Beauty [ area ], and adjacent categories in the store, where we've added an Ulta Beauty experience. \n In our other 3 core merchandise categories: Apparel, Home and Hardlines, we saw a rapid slowdown in the year-over-year sales trend beginning of March, when we began to annualize the impact of last year's stimulus payments. While we anticipated a post-stimulus slowdown in these categories and we expect the consumer to continue refocusing their spending away from goods and into services, we didn't anticipate the magnitude of that shift. \n As I mentioned earlier, this led us to carry too much inventory, particularly in bulky categories, including kitchen appliances, TVs and outdoor furniture. And with very little slack capacity after 2 years of unprecedented growth, we faced elevated cost to store and had begun rightsizing our inventory position. \n Nevertheless, we're still seeing healthy overall spending by our guests, even as their spending continues to evolve. Notably, we continue to see meaningful spending surges around holidays, including Easter in April and Mother's Day a couple of weeks ago. \n Also notable, in comparing this year's weekly sales of pre-pandemic levels at the beginning of 2019, we're actually seeing stronger 3-year growth trends in recent weeks compared with the beginning of the first quarter, even in categories where we saw a rapid slowdown on a 1-year basis. These encouraging longer-term growth trends demonstrate the continued resilience of the American consumer and the trust they place in Target even if they face multiple challenges. \n Not surprising, when we talk to our guests, they often express their concerns about a host of rapidly changing conditions, ranging from geopolitics to the high and persistent inflation they've been experiencing, particularly in food and energy. At the same time, guests are focused on getting back to many of the habits and behaviors they suspended during the heart of the pandemic, including travel, out-of-home activities and social gatherings. And importantly, even as the mix of what they're buying continues to evolve, their spending capacity continues to benefit from elevated saving rates, high employment and healthy wage growth. \n So as we continually adapt our offering to best serve our guests in a rapidly changing environment, today, we're focused more than ever on providing value across our multi-category assortment, presenting options that are affordable and accessible to a broad and diverse base of guests across a wide range of household incomes. And even as we face multiple cost pressures, our team is working tirelessly to maintain prices wherever possible. \n But of course, while it's always the last lever we pull, external conditions led us to raise prices across a broad set of items in multiple categories. But as you've clearly seen in recent quarters, overall costs have been rising much faster than retail prices, resulting in year-over-year declines in our gross margin rates. While we're not happy about the near-term pressure this causes on the profit line, we strongly believe these decisions will benefit our business over time. \n And as we currently monitor our prices and quality stack up versus the competition, our guests are telling us they appreciate the value and experience we're providing. More importantly, our guests are showing appreciation, with more footsteps in our stores and more clicks on our site, resulting in continued traffic and sales growth on top of record growth a year ago. \n As we look ahead, we'll maintain this focus on value, helping them to save time and money in a rapidly evolving environment. For those who are focused on driving pure miles in response to record high gas prices, our broadened unit merchandise assortment, combined with our low prices, offers a smart way to save time and miles by consolidating shopping trips. \n Of course, for guests who are looking for money-saving options when they're shopping for their families, our $30 billion portfolio of home brands offer outstanding quality and savings across every one of our merchandising categories. And because saving time is valuable in any environment, we're continuing to invest in expanding the scope of our reliable and convenient same-day services, including our Drive-Up and in-store pickup services, which we offer our guests at no charge. \n Just as we designed our merchandise portfolio to flexibly serve our guests, our operations have managed through extreme volatility over the last few years. Rapid growth amounting to tens of billions of dollars, combined with unprecedented shift in demand across categories, channels and services, has created a host of challenges for our team, which they've handled with incredible energy and focus. And while we entered this year hopeful that volatility will begin to moderate, we've experienced the extreme opposite in Q1, and we don't see current conditions improving right away. \n In the face of this volatility, our team continues to focus on the guest experience, working to ensure that anything our team is handling behind the scenes doesn't what our guests see and feel. So as we look ahead, it is clear that many of these pressures will persist in future quarters, but that hasn't affected our long-term plans and expectations, including our confidence in the ability of our business to grow mid-single digits and maintain an operating margin of 8% or higher over time. \n In the meantime, even as we navigate to restore profitability from the impact of these short-term challenges, we're continuing to invest in project design to deliver continued profitable long-term growth. Our business model and team have proven their ability to successfully navigate through extreme volatility. And we're confident our business will emerge even stronger from these challenges we're facing today. Just as our investments in early 2017 were followed by profitable growth in later years, we're confident the decisions we're making today, combined with our investments in future growth, will pay off handsomely over time. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Christina. Thanks, Michael. Before we move to your questions, I want to take a few minutes to reinforce why we're confident in the ability of our team and our durable business model to successfully navigate today's volatile environment and deliver continued profitable market share growth in the years ahead. \n As Michael covered, even as elevated costs put meaningful pressure on our near-term financial performance, our business today remains profitable and very healthy, and it continues to grow. Since the first quarter of 2019, both our revenue on the top line and our EPS on the bottom line have each grown by more than 40%. Underlying that growth, we benefited from strong increases in both guest traffic and average ticket over the last 3 years, meaning the guests have found more reasons to visit our stores and our site and purchase more when they shop. This is the definition of a durable business model, one that can stand up to the unexpected pressures and remain healthy and growing. \n When I think about the critical drivers of our long-term success, there are 2 things that rise to the top of that list: our team; and the relationship we've developed with our guests. And when I think about the quality of our team, I don't believe that it's ever been better. \n Over the last 5 years, we've made significant, purposeful investments to ensure we're hiring, elevating and retaining the best team in retail. These investments begin with paying benefits. But we've also found new ways to enhance the work experience and provide pathways for advancements, all in keeping with our Target forward goals to create an equitable and inclusive workforce and workplace. So even as we work tirelessly to restore our business to its long-term profitability, you should expect us to continue investing in our team, because we'll never achieve our longer potential without them. \n We have the same perspective regarding relationships with our guests. Over the last 5 years, we've made a number of deliberate decisions that were designed to deepen the relationship between Target and our guests. These decisions have resulted in ever-increasing traffic, translating to growth on both the top line and the bottom. \n So in the quarter just ended, when our team was facing potential trade-offs between a guest experience and incurring short-term costs, I am proud to say that they maintained their focus on the guest experience. That's because our team is laser-focused on our long-term financial performance, which depends on building and maintaining an ever-deepening relationships with our guests. \n So with that, I want to thank you for listening into our call today. And now Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Karen, as we stand in front of you and others in March, we did not anticipate the rapid shifts we've seen over the last 60 days. We did not anticipate that transportation and freight costs would soar the way they have as fuel prices have risen to all-time highs. While we were certainly anticipating the impact of overlapping stimulus and consumer and guest returning to more normal activities, we did not expect to see the dramatic shift in many categories that we've talked about, the shift from categories like TVs to luggage, from small appliances to toys, and guests celebrating, being out with friends. That certainly impacted our business in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue in Q2. And we certainly didn't anticipate the impact that would have on our supply chain costs. \n So things changed rapidly after we stood on stage in New York. We own that. It's what we're adjusting as we build our plans for the balance of the year. And we're committed to improving our operating performance over the second, third and fourth quarter and getting ourselves back on track for a more normalized environment in 2023. Karen, just finished my -- one of the things that hasn't changed since we were together in March and gives us great confidence as we go forward is the relationship we have with the guest. While we've certainly seen significant cost pressures since the start of this quarter, the guest continues to reward us with footsteps in our stores and growing traffic, more visits to our site. We feel very good about putting over 3% comps on top of 23% last year. The fact that traffic grew by almost 4% on top of 17% last year gives us great confidence that while we're facing some operating challenges, we've made that invisible for the guests. And we protected the guest experience as they shop our stores and visit our site. \n That gives us tremendous confidence that, that guest will continue to reward us, particularly as we provide great value and affordability during a time of need. So that continues to give us confidence, not in just this year, but in our out-year forecast. Well, Scott, obviously, we're watching this on almost a daily basis. And while we can't project into the future, I wish I had that crystal ball in front of me, we can tell you what we saw during the quarter and the start of May, where we just continue to see a resilient consumer. Our traffic numbers are up to start the second quarter. They're shopping multiple categories. And they're appreciating both the newness that we're providing, the seasonal relevance in our stores and in our assortment and the value we're providing. And we think that's critically important to our success over time. \n So I'd love to give you an outlook on what's going to happen with the consumer and how do they respond to ongoing inflationary pressure. But I can tell you, the traffic we saw in our stores and the visits in our site in the first quarter, the way that's continuing in May 1 tells us that we've built extraordinary trust over the last couple of years. And we're continuing to be rewarded by a guest and the consumer as we work into the second quarter. Well, Scott, we work each and every day to make sure we're finding efficiency throughout our operation. And certainly, coming out of the first quarter, we are doubling down on finding operating efficiencies and greater effectiveness in the organization. We know we've got to be really agile. And I think it's been one of our strengths over the last few years and certainly pronounced during the pandemic, that we have to be able to respond to a changing environment, whether it's the consumer changes, the economic changes around us. \n And we'll continue to make sure we're focusing on agility, maintaining that relationship with the guests, growing market share even in a volatile environment and making sure we just deepen that relationship with our guests, which we think, long term, along with investing in our team, is the most successful way for us to create value for our shareholders. Yes. Joe, we absolutely are looking at this very carefully. And you should expect us to surgically pass along cost where appropriate. But we're also laser-focused on protecting our value position in this environment and making sure we provide great affordability to the guests in a time of need. \n So we'll take a very balanced perspective on that. But I think we've got to start with doing the right thing for our guests and making sure we continue to provide the value that they look for from Target each and every day while we manage the cost environment and determine where and when we can pass along costs selectively. Operator, we have time for one more question today. All right. Operator, with that, we're going to conclude our call today. I really appreciate everyone participating. And we look forward to talking to you soon. So thank you."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. \n Just a few months ago, at our Financial Community Meeting, my presentation outlined our strategic vision as a company. While I covered many facets of our strategy that day, where I started then is where I want to start again today, with our guests. We frequently get questions about how our guests are feeling given the current economic environment, how their shopping habits are evolving and what's top of mind for them. \n Our guest base encompasses every slice of the American population given that we serve nearly 20 million guests on average each and every week. And the breadth of their individual decisions as they navigate a rapidly changing macro environment is just as broad, making the answers to those questions that much more complex.\n A guest might be telling us that they're worried about inflation and rising gas prices. But they're also looking to splurge on new shoes or some accent pillows for their home. Another guest remains worried about COVID, but they're still planning to resume travel and looking forward to summer outings like Little League games and barbecues with friends. Many guests are sharing their uncertainty of the overall state of the economy, but are feeling more positive about their personal finances. With so much on their minds and a wide array of wants and needs, it has never been more important for Target to be flexible and provide ease, safety, inspiration and solutions for all of our guests. \n In the first quarter, we invested in delivering a great guest experience to build and maintain the trust and love for the Target brand. And those decisions came with substantial costs. I'll share more on this shortly. Our first quarter results reinforce the power of our multi-category portfolio, which allows us to lean into those ever-changing wants and needs. \n More and more, we are seeing our guests increasing mobility and love of newness play out in their Target purchases as baskets shift more toward experiences and going-out categories. This includes notable strength in fashion forward apparel, prepaid cards, toys and travel. While apparel basics moderated in the quarter, trend-based apparel accelerated meaningfully as increasingly, people are returning to the office or dining out with friends. We're also seeing robust growth in Beauty, driven by particular strength in going-out categories like sunscreen, color cosmetics and fragrance. Luggage grew more than 50% as the world continues to reopen, and we reunite with the places and people we have missed visiting. \n And our owned brand portfolio continues to grow faster than total sales, as it has quarter-after-quarter for years now. We continuously benefit from the growing guest affinity for our owned brands, which are designed to drive trips to Target, not simply to provide another option when guests are already in a store. Our guests appreciate the value, quality and great design they have come to expect and love from Target owned brands, even as they continue to appreciate our national brand options and partnerships as well. \n As Brian outlined, our team delivered just over 3% in comparable sales growth in the first quarter, in line with expectations, reflecting strong traffic and unit share gains. First quarter growth was strongest in frequently purchased categories, including Food & Beverage, Beauty and Essentials. \n Food & Beverage, which delivered low double-digit growth this quarter was strong across the entire assortment. Over the last 3 years, first quarter Food & Beverage sales have increased by nearly $1.8 billion, accounting for nearly 1/4 of our total sales growth over that time. Market share gains in this category are being driven by unit share growth, most notably in our owned brand offerings, as more of our guests turn to Good & Gather and Favorite Day for their meal solutions. \n Beauty has been one of our fastest-growing categories for years now and grew again in the low double digits in Q1 as guests spend more time outside of the home and want to look and feel their best. Since the first quarter of 2019, Beauty sales have expanded by more than 45%, the mass majority of which occurred before our rollout of the Ulta Beauty at Target experience, evidence that there is still plenty of room for growth in this category. \n Essentials grew in the high single digits in Q1, having added well over $1 billion in first quarter sales over the last 3 years. Notably, nearly $0.5 billion of that growth happened after 2020, when we saw explosive demand for categories like household paper, over-the-counter and cleaning supplies.\n Across our other core categories: Apparel, Home and Hardlines, we saw small declines in comparable sales this quarter. In Apparel, despite unfavorable weather across most of the country, comp sales remained nearly flat to last year, having grown more than 60% in the first quarter a year ago and nearly $1 billion since the first quarter of 2019. \n In Home, even after a small pullback in Q1 comps, sales remain more than 40% higher than the first quarter of 2019, equating to more than $1.2 billion in growth over that time. Our seasonal categories continue to excel as our guests turn to Target for all of their holiday and celebratory solutions, leading to all-time records in the recent Valentine's Day and Easter seasons. \n And notably, guests are finding new ways to enjoy and celebrate the spaces they've invested in over the past few years. Having already renovated their homes with purchases in categories like furniture and small appliances, guests are now refreshing their homes with smaller touches, driving demand in categories like decor, candles and seasonal assortments; further evidence, not just of the strength in our multi-category portfolio, but the breadth of what we offer within categories as well. \n Hardlines saw a slight pullback in Q1, but has grown more than $1.3 billion since the first quarter of 2019. Within Hardlines, guests have been refocusing their spending away from electronics like TVs and into experiences for both kids and adults, which led to strength in our toys, travel and prepaid card categories. \n As Brian mentioned, first quarter gross margin performance was well below our expectations. This was driven by a number of factors, the most impactful of which was softer than expected sales in several categories, resulting in too much inventory in those areas. As we developed our plans for the quarter, our task was to anticipate how spending would change under circumstances no one had ever seen before given that we were about to compare over 2 years of historically high federal stimulus payments. As such, we relied on numerous forecasts and estimate, both internal and external, to help determine our view for the quarter. Despite this careful approach, the mix of actual demand materialized differently than we had anticipated. \n In addition, as supply grew and demand shifted away from bigger, bulkier products like furniture, TVs and more, we needed to make difficult trade-off decisions. We could keep this product knowing it would sell over time or we can make room for fast-growing categories like Food & Beverage, Beauty, and personal care and Household Essentials. To preserve the quality of on-shelf presentations and support the guest experience, we chose the latter, leading to incremental markdowns that reduced our gross margin. While these were difficult decisions, we believe they'll pay off in the long term, given that building long-term loyalty remains our top priority. \n As we look ahead, we'll continue to do all we can to support our guests, providing them great value, an unbeatable selection of necessities and affordable luxuries and a shopping experience that sparks a smile and provides a temporary escape. The second quarter offers many opportunities for our team to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. And this summer's assortment features some of our most inclusive offerings yet. \n First, in May, we are celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month by highlighting Asian founders and creators, amplifying their voices with stories of how their unique cultures influence the creation of their products and businesses. With June right around the corner, we're excited to honor our LGBTQ+ community as we celebrate Pride Month. This uplifting and always relevant assortment offers bold product, inclusive marketing and everyday affirmation that authentically represents and celebrates community and culture. And of course, we just finished celebrating mom in May and have plenty of options to honor dads in June, along with many other opportunities to celebrate the joys of summer. \n And speaking of joy, we're ecstatic about our recently announced expanded partnership with actress, author and social media phenomenon, Tabitha Brown, a beacon of positivity, inspiration and joy. Having collaborated with her on social media for years, we're excited to grow our partnership with Tabitha and feature 4 limited time-only collections set to launch over the next year, starting with an exclusive apparel and accessories line of more than 75 items this June that are sure to lift both style and spirit. \n Before I pass things over to John, I want to thank our teams across stores, distribution centers and headquarters locations all around the globe for their unwavering leadership and service to our guests and to each other. Without them, we would not be able to continue growing our business and serving our guests each and every day. Despite the volatility and rapid shifts in consumer demand, the macro environment and the global supply chain, our business remains strong, and we're confident in both our long-term strategy and our team's ability to navigate through this dynamic period. \n We continue to focus on serving our guests in all that we do through our ability to provide relevance and joy in our assortment, the delivery of a positive one-of-a-kind inspiring guest experience and by building lasting, deepened affinity over time. We're lucky to have the best team in retail to make all of this come to life, and I look forward to all we will do together in the second quarter and beyond. \n With that, I'll pass things over to John. Yes. I'd be happy to, Joe. We have been -- the last couple of years, we have been highly engaged in trying to understand the consumer. We've been through a series of chapters of consumer behavior shifts almost every 2 months for 2-plus years, honestly. And what we're seeing is that the consumer has taken control of their environment more so because the macro environment feels out of control. \n And so despite the fact that they might have worries about inflation, they're in charge. And they're making decisions based on their preferences and what they value, which means going back out, if that's what they want to do, traveling because they've missed it, seeing their friends and family again. And it's about moderating those behavior shifts and accommodating our assortment and our messaging and our relevance based on how those shifts happen. And so it's really important to stay close to the consumer and not expect that past behavior as an indicator of the future. Yes, Robbie, and if I could just add 2 cents to that. The breadth of our growth across our guest base was very broad. All income levels, demographic levels, it was broad. And that's because of our commitment to continue to be more and more relevant over time using the tools that Michael talked about, but really our commitment to being consumer-centric."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. I want to start my remarks today where John just ended and add my thanks to our entire team. Even with all of the challenges they've been facing, they refused to get distracted. Instead, they maintained their focus on our company purpose, to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. Our team shows up to work every day with a passion for serving all families and for serving each other. \n As John mentioned, it's been a joy in recent months to be able to travel once again, meet with teams across the country and hear what's on their minds. And the optimism and energy of our team is infectious. I can feel that whenever I meet with the team, and obviously, our guests can feel it when they shop, which explains why our first quarter traffic has increased more than 20% over the last 2 years. \n In the first quarter, our comp increase of 3.3% was supported by a traffic increase of 3.9%, partially offset by a small decrease in average ticket. Among our fulfillment channels, store sales grew slightly faster than digital in the quarter. Within digital, same-day services continue to drive our growth, and accounted for well over half of our first quarter digital sales; within our same-day services, Drive-Up accounts for the majority of sales, and it continues to grow the fastest. In fact, of the $3.3 billion in first quarter digital sales that we've added since 2019, Drive-Up accounts for nearly half of that growth. \n On the first quarter gross margin line, we saw a rate decline of about 4.3 percentage points compared with last year. Among the causal factors, merchandising actions drove about 3 percentage points of the decline, driven by the combined impact of impairments, markdowns and other actions taken to rightsize our inventory position in categories that were too heavy, along with the impact of higher freight costs. \n Among other drivers, higher supply chain costs accounted for a little over one percentage point of this year's rate decline, reflecting the impact of higher headcount and compensation in our distribution centers. Sales mix accounted for the remainder of the decline, worth about 10 basis points of pressure. \n On the SG&A expense line, we benefited from fixed cost leverage and strong expense control throughout the quarter, which helped to offset the impact of inflation-driven cost increases in multiple expense lines. Within compensation, the continued impact of team investments was offset by lower incentive compensation compared with last year. \n On the D&A expense line, we saw about 10 basis points of benefit in Q1, reflecting leverage on strong revenue growth. Altogether, our first quarter operating margin rate of 5.3% was about 4.5 percentage points lower than last year. While we expected this year's rate would be well below last year, our actual performance in the quarter was far lower than we anticipated, driven by the unexpectedly high costs we incurred on the gross margin line. \n Turning now to capital deployment, I'll start where I always do, by reiterating our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. First, we fully invest in our business and projects that support our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and look to build on our 50-year record of annual dividend growth. And finally, we return any remaining excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchases over time. \n Beginning with the top priority, first quarter CapEx was just under $1 billion, keeping us on track to spend $4 billion to $5 billion for the year. While our teams continue to face multiple challenges, including supply shortages, shipping delays and permitting and inspection delays in some communities, they're doing a great job of working around these obstacles and keeping projects moving. \n In addition, as John mentioned, unexpected inflationary pressures are affecting some of our capital projects, which will impact our total spending for the year. As I mentioned at our recent Financial Community Meeting, we're excited to make progress on our capital projects, which continue to move our business forward. And today, given the team's efforts to advance this year's projects, I believe we'll reach the high end of our $4 billion to $5 billion plan for the year. \n Moving to our second priority. We paid dividends of $424 million in the first quarter, up about 25% from last year. reflecting a 32% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in share count. We plan to recommend that our Board approve a healthy increase in the quarterly dividend, in the mid-teens to low 20% range later this year, keeping 2022 on track to be our 51st consecutive year of annual dividend increases. \n And finally, regarding share repurchases. Given our strong leverage metrics coming into the year, we entered into an accelerated repurchase plan in the first quarter, which will result in the retirement of up to $2.75 billion of our stock by the time the plan settles in June. In addition to this ASR, we repurchased another $10 million in shares in the first quarter. \n While we anticipate having continued ample capacity to return capital through share repurchases this year, given the current supply chain challenges we're facing and their impact on working capital, we now expect our total repurchases this year will be lower than the $7 billion we returned in 2021. As always, we'll adjust our pace, up or down, based on external conditions, business performance and cash flow, with a goal of maintaining our middle A credit ratings. \n So now I want to turn to our after-tax return on invested capital, which measures both our profitability and the efficiency of our CapEx decisions over time. In the first quarter, we reported a trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC of 25.3%. While this is a very strong number, indicative of the underlying health of our business, it was much lower than expected, near the very low end of where we expect to operate over time. \n Now let's turn to our guidance. In terms of the top line, based on our first quarter results and the trends we've seen so far in May, we continue to expect full year revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. In terms of our profitability, given the unexpected cost headwinds that we're currently facing, we now believe our full year operating margin rate will be well below our prior guidance of 8% or higher. More specifically, given the elevated level of volatility we're currently facing and multiple sources of uncertainty going forward, we see a range of potential outcomes, centered around a 6% operating margin rate for the full year. \n As John mentioned, in the second quarter, we expect the challenges we faced in the first quarter will continue to impact our near-term profit performance. And our team is focused on doing everything necessary to ensure we enter the fall season with an appropriate level of inventory by category. As such, we expect a Q2 operating margin rate in a wide range, centered around our first quarter rate to 5.3%, well below where we'd expect to operate under normal conditions. \n As we move into the back half of the year, we continue to expect our profit performance will begin to improve. In particular, as John mentioned, we expect to have worked through the excess inventory positions that hampered our Q1 performance and which we expect to impact our gross margin in Q2. That said, we don't expect the external environment will be anything close to normal in the back half of the year. In particular, we don't expect to see any meaningful reduction in global supply chain pressures until 2023 at the earliest. So the elevated costs we've been facing will continue to affect our profitability for the remainder of the year. \n But let me be clear about a couple of things. First, we are not happy with our current profit performance, and our team is laser-focused on helping to quickly restore our business performance to where it should be operating over time. That said, nothing that is happening today has changed our long-run expectations regarding the ability of our business to grow nor has it changed our view of the long-run potential of our business to deliver an operating margin rate of 8% or higher over time. \n And today, as we navigate these near-term challenges, we are fortunate to have an incredibly healthy underlying business, one that can stand up to the significant headwinds we're facing and come out stronger on the other side. We have ample financial capacity to continue making long-term investments, in new stores, remodels, supply chain, and of course, in our team, all with a focus on serving and delighting our guests, driving deeper loyalty, and building on the top line growth we've seen in recent years and which continues today. \n After all, even after a significant pullback from last year, first quarter earnings per share were more than 40% higher than in the first quarter of 2019 prior to the beginning of the pandemic. While that doesn't mean we're where we want to be operating today, it shows we have a strong foundation from which we can recover from today's challenging environment and restore our operating margins to 8% or higher over time, consistent with our long-term financial algorithm. And given the loyalty and momentum we've established with our guests and the power of the investments we continue to make, we expect to continue growing the top line, even as we regain the level of profitability we expect our business will generate over time. \n Now I'll turn it back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. We still got some inventory to work through. And so you saw some of that pain in Q1. And our gross margin guidance of Q2 of operating -- or sorry, our operating margin guidance of a 5.3%, give or take, a wide range around that, contemplates the work we still think we have to do on the inventory side in the second quarter. Importantly, we believe taking those actions in Q1 and Q2 set us up well for the balance of the year. We've got some big important seasons in front of us: back to school, back to college. It will be fall and holiday before we know it, and so we're taking the right actions now to preserve a guest experience that continues to be strong. You saw it in traffic in Q1, and we're excited about what we see as a start of Q2 on the top line as well. Yes. You hit on 2 of the bigger factors that will be at play in the back half of the year. As we've discussed, we see about $1 billion of freight and transportation pressure, outside of what we would describe even at the start of Q1. But we do expect, and we continue to take product in early intentionally to protect against supply chain disruption. We expect to see some offset as we don't anniversary the same level of air freight that we saw in the back half of the year. \n When it comes to mix, I mentioned in my remarks about a 10 basis point drag from margin rate mix. The biggest shift from a category perspective is just the change in some of the categories at the top of the guest shopping list. And some of those categories where we've got some inventory to work through are the ones we'll work through in the first half of the year, and will be better positioned heading into the second half. You hit the nail on the head in your question. The sustainability of scale benefits, especially as you've seen in SG&A leverage, that should be sticky, and we would expect it to be sticky. We've got some work to do on the margin line, and Q1 and Q2 outlook reflects that. But as we work through some of that inventory liability, as we let the levers we have to pull react to the current environment, to Brian's note, some of that snuck up on us in the first quarter, and we'll work through some of that over time. But we continue to have a lot of confidence that the long-term run rate of profitability for the business is in the 8% range, give or take. And it's our work to do the hard work to get back to that path. Sure. Thanks for the question, Kate. As we shared in remarks, the headline story for us is traffic growth. But if you -- as you decompose ticket, we did see a low single digit increase in ASPs, offset by a reduction in units per basket. As you've heard us probably say many times before, a lot goes into that ASP number. It's a little bit product mix, it's a little bit how much inflation is in the environment. And so a little trickier to decompose there, but that's just a little more color on what we saw in the basket. \n We continue to be laser-focused on that traffic number. That's a great indicator for us of how -- what we're doing is resonating with the guests and to continue growing the top line by growing and deepening engagement with Target. That positions us well for the back part of the year, and that positions us to have the top line that we want as we rightsize the profit picture over time. Yes. There's -- I mean, obviously, there's a lot of factors at play as we look at Q2 and the balance of the year. I think we used the language, we wouldn't expect it to be normal for the balance of this year. So our best view of those factors is in our Q2 guide of 5.3%, plus or minus, a wide range around that, and in our guide of 6% for the year. Yes. You're certainly pointing in the right direction there, Joe. We've given the kind of explicit expectations for Q2, but implied in the full year is an improving profitability picture that will come through margin in the balance of the year. To focus on the annual in the long run there is a theme that I've come back to over and over. Quarterly margin is going to have more volatility than one might think. But in the long run, we're pleased with what we see as the potential of the profitability of the business. And we'll be on a path in the back half of this year to take steps in that direction for sure. Yes, Ed. The -- it's a good question. There's a few things going on if you look at the level of inventory on our balance sheet. One is we've got some categories where we need to work through some inventories. We've already talked about that piece. There's a little bit of product cost inflation sitting in that number, too. But I will say, given our desire to make sure we're landing some product earlier and protect against supply chain volatility, for the near term here, you should expect kind of that new normal of sales growth to inventory growth to include some working capital investments as we land some of that product sooner to make sure we've got it for the guest. \n And so those are the 3 big factors that we're watching. Obviously, the first of those factors, we'll work to make some progress on here in the second quarter to get us in line with what we expect sales trends to look like for the back part of the year. But old normal might not be the current run rate in the near term as we work to secure product, land it early and avoid some of the disruptions that have caused out of stocks over the last year. We feel good about the gross margin performance in grocery. And just Food & Beverage in general has been such a steady top line grower, share gainer quarter after quarter. And so the strength that we've built in that category, I think, makes the economics in Food & Beverage work in the right direction. We've talked a lot, and I think it's important as we think about consumer looking for value, the strength of the owned brands in Food & Beverage, Good & Gather and Favorite Day and the guest response we've seen to those 2 owned brands has just been incredible. And that's great from a guest preference perspective. It's also good for margin. Yes. We're obviously looking at that across all categories and making sure that we're providing great value to our guests in spite of those inflationary cost pressures. No different approach in food and beverage, where we're looking to get that balance right there, too. So it's always a little bit of a mix of both when we're doing our job, right? But the thing that we come back to when it comes to driving traffic is just driving deeper and deeper engagement. And you've heard us talk in the past with over 100 million Target Circle guests. That's just one more way that we can continue to drive preference in a personalized way and build deeper and deeper engagement with Target over time. \n And you can see that coming through in the traffic results we see, not just in this quarter, but over the past couple of years. And that gives us a lot of optimism that what we're doing is resonating with the guests, and that should bode well for the balance of the year and beyond."

I'd like to start by welcoming the investors and others who are attending this meeting in person with us. And of course, we're happy that many, many more of you are attending the meeting remotely. Brian is going to kick off the meeting in a minute, but first, I have a couple of important disclosures.\n First, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in our SEC filings. And second, in today's remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in our financial press releases, financial presentations and SEC filings, which are posted on our Investor Relations website.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to get things started.\n [Presentation] \nBrian Cornell: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to providing our perspective on the results we shared this morning, and I can't wait for you to hear from several of our top leaders, including Christina Hennington, Rick Gomez, Jill Sando, Cara Sylvester and Michael Fiddelke. While Michael still has his hands firmly on the wheel as CFO, this is his first FCM in his new role as our Chief Operating Officer. I can tell you, we're looking forward to discussing Target's growth horizon and how it transcends volatility over any particular quarter or year. Our preference is always to think long term.\n It's why for years now, we've emphasized the durability of our business model. And many of you have validated that orientation in the conversations we've had with you over the years. So our session today will focus squarely on the long-term thinking that has driven top and bottom line growth over the last decade and positions us for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. You might be asking, why focus on decades? In part because that feels like a long enough time frame to be meaningful. But it's also because we look at longer horizons when evaluating growth potential for investments like new stores, supply chain and other assets. \n And it's good to ask what else would need to be true for those investments to succeed? So we'll analyze our 2023 performance in that context. We'll provide insights on how our '24 plans and guidance fit into that vision. And we'll spend time outlining our plan for sustained growth as well as our capacity to react to unforeseen realities. Both have been important over the last 10 years.\n By designing for steady growth before 2020, we were positioned to absorb exponential growth during a demand boom that none of us could have anticipated. Even now the country and the retail industry, are in a prolonged, post-pandemic return to normal, which has been nearly as unpredictable as a pandemic itself from a consumer, social, political and economic perspective. By staying agile as a team and by continuously refining our approach and innovating, we've been able to navigate this time frame.\n In fact, if you think back to our earlier algorithms and long-range plans, we're well ahead of where we believe we'd be just a few short years ago. At the same time, we recognize this is a unique moment to clarify our road map for growth. Let me be really clear. Our goal is to recapture profitable sales, traffic and market share gains by expanding what makes Target different and better for our guests, amplifying our appeal to consumers beyond our existing guest base, and reinforcing the innovation and investment that drive durable and consistent results for our business and shareholders. So I might start today with the elements of the overall strategy that have been staples all along and will continue to be staples going forward.\n Starting with our stores. The most visible and tangible proof of our long-term planning and investment. When I arrived at Target, we had just over 1,800 stores that didn't quite cover all 50 states. Since then, we built more than 200 new stores. We've invested in more than 1,200 existing locations through remodels and partnerships, and our store footprint has expanded to cover the entire U.S. While retail is decades in the new digital era, on any given day, 2/3 or 3/4 of all U.S. shopping is still done in stores. And thanks to the stores-as-hub model, we invented in the last decade, nearly all Target shopping, including our significant digital penetration growth and our $30-plus billion in revenue growth was made possible by our stores.\n So if you think store shopping will wind down anytime in the next decade, we'll politely disagree on that point once again. Over the next decade, we expect to open more than 300 new mostly full-size stores and [ make ] billions of dollars in incremental growth, while continuing to remodel stores with plans to invest in the vast majority of our nearly 2,000 stores in the next 10 years. We'll also continue to invest in our supply chain and technology. In less than 10 years, we've created, acquired and constantly advanced sortation centers, upstreamed distribution centers, food distribution centers, and a steady stream of replenishment, technology and logistics innovation. At least 10 additional supply chain facilities are in the pipeline, and will be operating within the next decade.\n Underpinning all of this is our long-standing and ongoing investment in technology. This includes a leading team of engineers, data scientists and product managers focused on further integrating AI and machine learning and driving early adoption of generative AI, all geared towards making it easier for our team to best serve our guests across both the digital and physical assets. Take same-day fulfillment. Our initial investments gave us an early lead in same-day. Today, same-day is much more competitive but continued innovation and better integration with our Target ecosystem means we're ready to expand same-day delivery for our guests while also building on our next-day capabilities. You'll hear more about this from Christina and Cara including big moves we're making with Target Circle, a program that didn't exist 10 years ago, but today has well over 100 million members.\n Cara will talk about the incredible progress the team has made with Target Circle and where we're headed next. For now, I'll just emphasize the focus we're placing on unlimited same-day delivery through a new membership feature called Target Circle 360, which is launching next month. Here's the takeaway. Without huge investments in stores, supply chain and tech, there is no drive-up or order pickup, which were monumental growth drivers during COVID and today. And without stores, supply chain and tech and providers like UPS, FedEx and Shipt, there is no home delivery which is ready for a step change in guest acquisition, satisfaction and loyalty. As we move forward, we'll leverage our 2017 acquisition of Shipt to help us build unmistakable recognition for Target same-day delivery.\n Target's Roundel advertising business is another example of something that didn't exist 10 years ago. But today, it's the fastest-growing contributor to the other revenue line on our P&L. In a crowded field of similar offerings, we're punching way above our weight relative to the scale of our retail footprint. The unique relationship we have with our guests and the value our ad business unlocks for the brands that advertise with us are at the heart of Roundel's performance to date. And since our road map for growth focuses on strengthening our relationship with guests, and converting more consumers into guests, we see tremendous growth potential for Roundel for years to come.\n There are a number of other points of continuity and cohesion in our strategy. But for this intro, I'll focus on just one more. That's the strength of our multi-category portfolio and the balance and stability offered by our mix of frequency and discretionary categories. The way we bring those categories to consumers is a stand-out strength we'll continue to build on. The curation, the authority and trend in newness and the competitive advantage and assortment built around beloved national brands, world-class brand partnerships and a fleet of owned brands that drives about 1/3 of our business and puts us in a league of our own.\n Ten years ago, our Starbucks and Disney collaborations were strong and growing, and we're building our partnership with Apple. Those 3 relationships continue to grow throughout this time frame, and we added and expanded outstanding partnerships with CVS, Levi's, Hearth & Hand with Magnolia and Ulta Beauty at Target that drive traffic, sales and loyalty. This element of our strategy has been a bright part of our future. It will continue to play a big role in the decade ahead. And our team's expertise and product design and development and brand creation and management, they're towering strengths that really fuel our own brand portfolio.\n Brands like Cat & Jack, Threshold, Good & Gather, they bring millions of guests to Target. There are 3 of the 11 brands that generate $1 billion or more in sales each year, a lineup that looked much more modest a decade ago. And they lead a roster of Target brands that contribute to more than $30 billion in annual sales, plus outstanding margins for our bottom line.  A steady cadence of brand launches like Figmint last year, and dealworthy last month, help keep our edges sharp on the newness, discovery and affordability consumers crave in the market and find at Target. I believe our own brand capabilities will only become more prominent in the decade ahead, which is why we'll spend time this morning taking you behind the scenes on where we're headed with our owned brands. \n Another area where we'll continue to excel is our commitment to our team. In the last decade, we've taken a leadership position in both pay and benefits and learning and development and we'll continue to be a pacesetter as we ensure our team has all the support they need to take care of our guests, themselves and their families. So as we start to pull all this together, you might be saying, Brian, clearly, Target has some strong assets and advantages and cultivated a great team. But what does that mean for 2024 or 2034? I can tell you, our team has been humble enough as that and many other related questions. We're not taking anything for granted. There's no complacency about our past success. And while we recognize that a rebound in discretionary spending will favor our brand and our business. We're not waiting for economic changes or a different consumer outlook.\n I've been on the road nonstop since November, walking our stores, distribution floors. And I can tell you, the energy and initiative of our front-line team. What they're bringing to our business this year simply can't be conveyed on the slides behind me. This team has shifted to their front foot, and they're changing the momentum of our business, which is why we've seen sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 to Q4. Discretionary declines moderated. Traffic trends rebounded. Our Q4 comps were the high end of our guidance. We drove major gains in efficiency and outperformed our guidance of $1 billion in full year profit growth. Recognizing that we needed to clear the volatility and the challenges in the last 2 years, our team buckled down and said, \"Go time.\"\n But in recent weeks, I've seen the spelling expand by 2 letters. And I've seen the ambition, expand even more than that. What our team is talking about now is grow time. That's the mantra I hear bubbling up from the front line, all with the commitment to recapturing top line growth, traffic and share gains in the years immediately ahead. That starts with ensuring our team can deliver for our guests each and every day. A major step is coming soon with the upgrades we're launching in Target Circle. Upgrades that will make it even easier to unlock the best of Target. At the same time, a focused list of priorities, along with a continued concentration on retail fundamentals, like affordability and in-stock reliability, will make our guest experience easy and dependable in every interaction. We'll continue to focus on delighting our guests with the products, partnerships and value that make Target feel both elevated and accessible.\n The hallmarks here are expert curation, style and trend authority, newness, great design and incredible value. We'll also accelerate our progress in omnichannel discovery. We've all seen how shopping is changing into an always-on activity that's integrated across several aspects of our lives, well beyond physical and digital stores. Discovery and inspiration has always been a hallmark of our shopping experience. We started by providing inspiration and easy access at our stores with no barriers between impulse and purchase. But we see an opportunity to do even more, to think differently about the intersection of physical, digital and social. So consumers can discover Target products wherever they're spending their time. So you'll hear from Christina and Cara this morning, we're going to keep building our capabilities in omnichannel discovery since we see this as an advantage that's ownable over our retail rivals.\n So I've thrown a lot on the table, and there's more definition and detail to come. Having tackled both industry and in-house challenges over the last couple of years, I can tell you, I'm not satisfied. And our team is not satisfied with our recent top line results. We wanted to be even further along than we are today, but we're confident in our path forward, and we're eager to share what's next. Target is not just a bigger company than it was 10 years ago. It's stronger, healthier and more resilient, a company that's flipping the switch from go time to grow time.\n Over the next hour or so, I'll ask Christina, Rick, Jill, Cara and Michael, to add some texture to those claims. Thanks again for being here. Christina, over to you. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on what you've heard so far this morning, I want to emphasize 2 key themes. First, we build the foundation for long-term growth with a strategy that is both unique to Target and durable. And second, we're committed to building on that foundation for years to come. So this morning, I'll walk through the ways we're leaning into our core strengths, capabilities and differentiators we've built and refined over time to meet consumers where they are and drive long-term market share gains, sales growth and profitability.\n I want to start with an outlook on the consumer, which remains mixed. While there are some encouraging signs in the economy, there are also stubborn pressures impacting families and retails. Consumers say they still feel stretched, they're balancing a lot and having to make trade-offs to meet their needs of their families while sprinkling in the occasional luxury.\n And yet their affinity for style and newness plus early signs of disinflation contributed to a sequential uptick in discretionary category performance over the last 2 quarters, something we aim to build on and accelerate. At the same time, we expect consumers will remain highly value conscious, hunting for great promotions and seeking comprehensive value in their purchases. Consumers are also creating stability with small doses of everyday joy. After the volatility of the global pandemic, they're now coping with geopolitical tensions, social and political divisiveness and uncertainty around personal finances. This all demonstrates that our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life remains incredibly relevant. And the assets and capabilities we've [ culted ] over time, like new and remodeled stores, investments in digital shopping, supply chain and loyalty, they've all increased consumers' view of us as an omnichannel powerhouse.\n Those enhanced strengths were built on long-established differentiators like design, curation, a well-balanced multi-category assortment and outstanding value. And those are just some of the elements we'll build upon and amplify through our strategy as we move through 2024 and beyond. \n Think about the opportunities around something like omnichannel discovery, designing experiences that support discovery has always been one of our strengths. Our stores are famous or perhaps infamous for inspiring guests to discover more than they expected. Millions of guests have experienced the joy of entering a Target store for a few items and end up leaving with extra treasures they didn't anticipate. This is a key aspect of how we set ourselves apart from our competitors and something we'll continue to build on, regardless of where or how the shopping trip begins. After all, shopping looks very different now than it did a few years ago. It's no longer a point-in-time transactional event. Consumers today are constantly taking in new information and seeking inspiration from influencers and trendsetters.\n Target is already a trend shaper, but there's an opportunity to accelerate this further on both the platforms we own and on external platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Cara will share more specifics later. So I'll just say that our team's energy and engagement in building these discovery-driven experiences are truly inspiring. It's indicative of an ambition to meet consumers where they are. So that wherever and however a shopping journey starts, the path leads back to Target as a destination.\n We have long been known for delighting guests through a carefully curated set of products and partnerships. We believe that a well-curated assortment isn't just good for managing inventory. It can be additive to the shopping experience, too. Here's an extreme example. Imagine a restaurant with a seemingly infinite menu with countless of -- pages of every type of cuisine and no cohesive point of view. Endless choice creates decision fatigue, taking away from an otherwise joyful outing. Sometimes less is truly more. We make choices that allow us to offer a menu of products, designing to serve a wide variety of guest needs, helping to guide their shopping journey while ensuring a joyful and productive trip. Now to be clear, this does take balance. We don't offer an endless aisle, but we do offer a compelling range of choices and price points throughout our assortment.\n We think of our assortment like a 3-legged stool. It works best when we develop owned brands that offer unmatched value and quality, provide the best industry-leading national brands and cultivate partnerships that enhance our assortment. So let's start with our owned brands. We've invested heavily over the past several years to continue to innovate and differentiate through our owned brands, and we're not slowing down. Across the portfolio, we're launching new brands and expanding upon those already loved by our guests. In fact, owned brands are so core to who we are, following my remarks, I've asked Jill Sando and Rick Gomez to join me and highlight how our unique skills and assets allow us to sustain and grow this massive owned brand portfolio. And it's because of these differentiated end-to-end capabilities that we're able to rapidly scale affordable owned brands without compromising quality.\n These capabilities also make us an attractive partner to some of the greatest designers around. Recently, we announced an upcoming partnership with iconic fashion designer, Diane von Furstenberg. This collection will feature the signature patterns and colors that DVF is known for, along with her iconic wrap dresses. With a multigenerational appeal and offerings in extended sizes as well as options for kids, this collection features more than 200 items spanning apparel, accessories, beauty and home, combining timeless fashion with only at Target prices and value.\n Our second priority is to extend our assortment with the best national brand consumers want from Target. Stanley Drinkware is a timely example. Well before it became a cultural moment, we were early to recognize this brand's potential allowing us to get a big jump on this trend. We secured great allocations across the portfolio and partnered with Stanley to create exclusive colors for our guests, both in the core line and through our only at Target brand Hearth & Hand with Magnolia.\n Similarly, celebrity-founded Beauty brands are taking over social media, and our guests say they want to find them at Target. That's why we partnered with Ashley Tisdale, on our exclusive to Target launch of Being Frenshe, a line of personal care products powered by mood boosting scents and self-care rituals. It's also why we've recently added Lemme, Kourtney Kardashian Barker's new line of vitamin and botanical supplements to our assortment. These trending brands add to the credibility we built in the Beauty space and will continue to support our leadership role in these categories.\n Our third priority is to round out our assortment with a focus on partnerships, which provide deeper expertise and brand recognition for our guests. We've had tremendous success attracting and cultivating these unique collaborations and, in the years ahead we expect they'll play an even bigger role given the incrementality they've delivered. We continue to expand the presence of Ulta Beauty at Target, Levi's, Apple, Disney and more bringing industry-leading offerings and continued differentiation for Target. And last year, we launched a new partnership with Kendra Scott, and our guests couldn't get enough. These colorful jewelry and accessory pieces not only look good, but they do good too. With a shared vision for philanthropy, this collaboration shines bright on multiple levels. Expect plenty of new offerings in this partnership in 2024 and for years to come.\n Surrounding all our assortment choices is an unwavering focus on value, which starts with price but encompasses so much more. We continue to offer fantastic everyday low prices, and we're focused on clearly and effectively communicating our value proposition. One way we've done this is by simplifying our end caps to feature single price points and promotions. This allows us to clarify the incredible value we offer while helping our guests to effortlessly recognize the value. No games, no confusion.\n Additionally, our efficiency efforts and the greater size and scale we've achieved in the recent years have allowed us to further sharpen price points across our assortment. We continuously find ways to add quality and newness to our own brand portfolio without increasing prices. And of course, our focus on retail fundamentals serves as a through line supporting guests on their shopping journey before, during and after they make a purchase. These efforts are always on focus, and we continue to deliver a unique blend of physical and digital shopping, will further leverage our fleet of nearly 2,000 stores to serve as inspiring shopping destinations and as fulfillment hubs for digital orders. And in the same way we focus on our store and digital assets, we continually invest in our team.\n We take care of our team so they can take care of our guests. From providing world-class service to ensuring we're in stock, we want our guests to feel confident that they will be cared for and find what they seek on every Target run. In fact, it was a dedication of our team that allowed us to maintain leaner, healthier inventory levels last year, which positions us well as we enter a new year. This led to stronger profit outcomes, improved in-stocks and perhaps, most importantly, increased flexibility, allowing us to react quickly to changing trends.\n We're also using technology to reduce costs, increase delivery speed and improve consistency in our operations. Years ago, we took a bold stance when we outlined our plans to invest in stores at a time when the role of brick-and-mortar was in question. Investing to automate upstream replenishment and optimize last-mile delivery, we develop new ways to increase our delivery speed and reduce operating costs. These technology investments, which increased through the throughput of our existing store locations helped to quiet the store-versus-digital debate. As we pioneered the stores-as-hub strategy in support of the omnichannel services we provide.\n We're excited about the impact of continued advancements in technology like generative AI and the additive ways these tools will empower our teams. But we also want to make sure that human connection remains at the center of the Target experience. This is why we'll continue to invest in technology while never losing sight of what makes life rich. The relationships and interactions we have with one another. Just as we uniquely saw the importance of combining physical stores and digital capabilities, we want to make sure we lean into emerging technologies and focus on placing them in the hands of our incredible Target team.\n And finally, we'll continue to invest in technology to support segmentation and personalization. We love it when guests walk into one of our nearly 2,000 locations and says, \"This is my Target.\" In the same way, we want to design an experience in which a guest places an item in their cart and says, \"This was made just for me.\" This balance of scale and personalization is unique in retail, something we do well and can continue to build on. After all, we have an enviable consumer base that is highly engaged with our brand and they shop us frequently across our multi-category assortment, allowing us to gain invaluable insights across nearly all retail segments, not just 1 or 2. \n It's also why our Roundel advertising business is so powerful. We're constantly listening and learning from our guest base, allowing us to offer rich insights to our vendors, offer compelling and personalized advertisements to our guests and grow this aspect of the business in meaningful and lasting ways. You'll hear more from Cara on enhancements to our loyalty ecosystem, Roundel's growing reach and our digital experience aimed at enhancing digital discovery.\n It's one thing to hear about these strategic initiatives, and it's another thing to see them in action. I'm often on the road to witness firsthand how our guests are experiencing joy through our assortment, shopping experience and our teams' dedication in serving them every day. On a recent trip to Orlando, I visited one of our smaller stores near Disney World. Our segmentation and assortment planning work, let us focus on serving 2 very distinct segments in this market. One segment consists of the many Disney cast members who utilize this Target store to meet their everyday wants and needs on their way to and from work. The other segment is comprised of families who are visiting the area looking to get everything they need to support their family vacations. These guest segments have very different Target run missions, and yet we're able to provide a cohesive experience that satisfies both of them.\n Similarly, a few weeks back, I traveled to Texas with members of my Beauty and Apparel teams. We heard directly from guests about the love of finding all their styling needs under one roof. From cosmetics and skin care items in Ulta Beauty, to apparel assortments only available at Target to bold jewelry pieces from Kendra Scott. These powerhouse brands have all come together to offer consumers at this store, a sum that is greater than the individual parts.\n On another trip, I visited a store in Mississippi, where we had recently completed a wall-to-wall remodel. We elevated the shopping experience, refreshed the assortment and even added a Starbucks, the first one ever in this area. Our local team is incredibly proud that their Target store has become the social hub of this tight-knit community. These examples illustrate the interplay of our strategies, assortment, experience and capabilities. Showing how we're positioning Target to play a unique role in American retail.\n So now before I turn things over to Cara, I'm going to invite Jill and Rick to the stage for a discussion on the power of Target's owned brand capabilities, and how they help Target stand out in a crowded marketplace. \nA. Hennington: Okay. Well, thanks for joining me. Why don't we start Jill and Rick by telling us a little bit about yourselves and your careers. \nJill Sando: Good morning. I am Jill Sando and I lead the Apparel & Accessories, Home and Hardlines merchandising organization. I've been with Target for over 25 years. The majority of that time has been in merchandising, running different businesses across our discretionary portfolio. Also spent some time in planning and help stand up our product design and development capabilities for our non-apparel businesses. \nRichard Gomez: Hello. Good morning. I'm Rick Gomez, I lead Target's Food, Essentials and Beauty businesses. I've had the opportunity to lead a variety of different disciplines at Target, including marketing, digital strategy. And then before Target, I spent over 20 years working in the CPG industry developing, launching and managing a bunch of different Food & Beverage brands. \nA. Hennington: We're happy to have you here. Okay. Our owned brand portfolio on its own would be a Fortune 100 company. More than $30 billion in sales and nearly 1/3 of our total revenue and even more of our gross margin. That's because we have amazing capabilities that allow us to produce brands our guests genuinely love. Jill, let's start with one I know you're particularly excited about a new brand in toys called Gigglescape. \nJill Sando: Kids related categories are huge for Target and toys plays a key role in keeping Target relevant with families. National brands like LEGO and exclusive brands like Our Generation have made Target one of the biggest toy retailers in America. And the addition of Gigglescape gives consumers on more only-at-Target reason to shop toys. Gigglescape is important for a few reasons. It's consumer-centric. It's our first owned brand design specifically for generation alpha and their unique needs. It's filling white space in our owned brand assortment and it has us poised to drive growth in a high-margin category.\n And Gigglescape is priced to be accessible to all families. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our stuffed animals. Most are priced under $10 and soon we'll launch books, puzzles and toys with all items in our spring assortment priced under $20. That kind of pricing makes it perfect for gifts and for the spur-of-the-moment purchases because your child is being good today. This is a brand that makes our toys destination -- our toys department a destination even when your Target run was inspired by something else and makes Target an even stronger destination for toys. \nA. Hennington: I love them. They're super cute. Okay. Rick, our frequency categories play such a crucial role in driving trips. And with up & up and dealworthy, we're giving our guests new reasons to choose Target. Can you tell us about that? \nRichard Gomez: Yes. Well, as you know, Christina, we invest a lot of time listening to consumers to better understand their needs. And one of the themes that we are consistently hearing is the need for value and affordability. So to address this consumer need, we are relaunching up & up and introducing dealworthy. up & up is one of Target's most popular brands, delivering nearly $3 billion in sales, offering over 2,000 everyday items at affordable prices. And now we are making it even bigger and even better. We have developed product improvements across 40% of the line. We are also introducing hundreds of new items, and we are offering great prices with the average item priced under $7.\n We're also launching dealworthy. It's our new low-priced brand with items across the store, ranging from socks, laundry detergent, phone chargers, and I can't stress enough what a great value dealworthy will be. The most items will be priced under $10. And some of those electronics items will be priced at 50% lower than what was previously offered at Target. dealworthy will be the lowest-priced item in each category offering absolutely incredible value. \nA. Hennington: Indeed, our frequency businesses are an important part of driving trips to Target, meeting guest critical needs but our discretionaries have the -- categories have the opportunity to do that as well. Jill, can you tell us a little bit about Cat & Jack? \nJill Sando: Yes. Kids apparel is another area where we have outsized market share and Cat & Jack is a big part of that. This is the kids brand that we launched in 2016. Today, it's a $3 billion brand, the biggest kids brand in America. To put that into perspective, consider this, we sell well over 300 million units of Cat & Jack a year, which comes out to about 8 Cat & Jack items for every child in America under the age of 12. This is part of a discretionary category, but Cat & Jack is a brand that drives repeat business for Target because of great prices and great quality, which parents love and great design that kids love.\n And when you think about kids style, the success of Cat & Jack pays dividends across our portfolio. It drives trips and sales across the store during key moments like back-to-school and throughout the year as kids grow into new sizes. Cat & Jack also complements brands like Wild Fable. That's our juniors brand, worn by millions of teens and tweens who started in Cat & Jack. It's one of the biggest juniors brands in the country and one we just extended into swim. Wild Fable is a great brand on its own, one fueled by our speed to trend in a very dynamic category, but it also has an important advantage since families are already in the habit of turning to Target for clothes for their kids. \nA. Hennington: Thank you, Jill. Rick, let's switch gears a little bit and talk about Good & Gather because that's a brand that's helped us reimagine our grocery space and experience and really build our credibility in food. \nRichard Gomez: Yes. Absolutely. I'd love to talk about Food & Beverage. Our Food & Beverage business delivers over $20 billion in sales, and that's up $8 billion in sales since 2019. That's because over the last few years, we've been making big strides in improving the Food & Beverage experience. I'd like to say that we have gone from being a retailer that just sells food to a retailer that truly celebrates food. And in doing that, we have made Target a destination for food. Now, Good & Gather has played a key role in that at nearly $4 billion in sales. Good & Gather delivers a great value proposition, delicious products that the whole family will enjoy, high-quality ingredients with no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup. And importantly, great pricing with most items under $5.\n And we're not done growing the Good & Gather brand. Last fall, we expanded Good & Gather into new incremental spaces that are important to our guests like Good & Gather Baby and Toddler creating another go-to Target -- another go-to category for parents with young children at Target. \nA. Hennington: Well, it's abundantly clear that our guests rely on our owned brands. Jill, you've been a part of these launches for so many years in your career. What makes us a leader in this space? \nJill Sando: We have unrivaled design capabilities, amazing talent across our team, hundreds of patents, it is no exaggeration to say that Target pioneered cheap [indiscernible]. And what we're doing is so hard to replicate because we didn't decide to make a play in owned brands 5 or even 10 years ago. We've been doing this for decades. We've had an in-house sourcing capability for 25 years. Now today, it spans 20 offices across 14 countries. Because we own our end-to-end sourcing business, we control our own destiny. When you think about issues like country of production and raw material costs. We're more cost-effective with far fewer intermediaries in our network, which allows us to grow our bottom line even as we pass savings on to our guest.\n We can adapt quickly to emerging trends, which keeps us relevant and we're able to pursue bold sustainability goals, which is important to driving growth by delivering on something that matters so much to millions of consumers. And those sustainability goals will also help ensure both the resiliency of our business model through responsible stewardship of the resources that we rely on and our ability to deliver the quality that our guests rely on. \nRichard Gomez: And these capabilities, they really do set Target apart, especially considering the scale at which we operate, delivering a steady drumbeat of newness to consumers. In my previous role in the CPG industry, it was a big year if we launched a few dozen new products. But for our food scientists, that's a couple of weeks' worth of work. In Food & Beverage alone this year, we'll add hundreds of new items to Good & Gather and Favorite Day and that's on top of the hundreds of new items that we launched last year. We are delivering innovation at scale that is unmatched by others. \nA. Hennington: Well, our capabilities certainly are first rate. But that human touch, fueled by the power of insights, can't be stressed enough. \nJill Sando: That's right. When we designed All In Motion, our performance brand, the first thing that we did was to engage with 15,000 consumers. We talked to fitness coaches, we attended dozens of workout classes because if you're designing for the consumer, it starts with listening to the consumer. And we're not just consumer-led when we're launching a product, we're consumer-led in how we continue to grow and develop our owned brands because you can't mistake performance for potential.\n Cat & Jack has been a runaway success, but we also learned through listing that we had opportunities to make the brand more appealing to more guests. Among other things, that led to the adaptive items we created to help all kids look and feel their best and the expansions we made to our dressy and mid-dressy assortment, giving families more reasons to choose Cat & Jack and Target. \nRichard Gomez: Consumer insight has also helped to continue to develop and grow Favorite Day. We launched the brand during the pandemic, and we've seen it drive trips, build baskets, delivering double-digit growth year after year. So as Food & Beverage has become a go-to category for Target during the holidays, we've expanded the role of Favorite Day to offer key seasonal items. You saw that in November and December with gingerbread kits, hot cocoa-bombs, a huge range of snack mixes. And just a few weeks ago, Favorite Day was front and center for Valentine's Day. And we'll continue to expand Favorite Day into those big seasonal moments that are so important to our guests and important to keeping Target relevant. \nA. Hennington: Well, Jill, this leads the enhanced approach we take into brand management, including a team under your leadership. \nJill Sando: We launched our brand management capability years ago and created an end-to-end process to successfully launch owned brands. And that has enabled an accelerated rollout of owned brands over the past 5 years. And we've been evolving our capabilities and are now operating more like a CPG company, the research, the market analysis, looking hard at the white space. That's shaped our decision making around existing brands, like prioritizing Threshold as our flagship home brand and then offering a range of styles within it. That's critical because Target is one of the biggest home retailers in the country, and this is making it easier for our consumers to navigate our assortment and our brand management work was critical to the success of our new kitchenware brand Figmint, which debuted last fall.\n This isn't the first time selling kitchenware as part of an owned brand, but it is our first owned brand devoted solely to Kitchenware and our guests love it. Baskets with Figmint items are 25% larger than our previous owned brand offering. And Figmint was one of several factors that helped us accelerate our Kitchenware business by more than 500 basis points between Q3 and Q4 taking us from a negative comp to a positive comp. Guests respond to newness and innovation and great design and Figmint is just one example of that. \nRichard Gomez: There's been a lot of work in Food & Beverage to sharpen the focus of our brand portfolio. The launch of a flagship brand, Good & Gather was the first step. We focused Market Pantry on family favorites at our most affordable prices and we've also retired our previous snack and dessert brand, Archer Farms and replaced with Favorite Day, a brand with a much stronger identity around indulgent treats for the whole family.\n All of this helps Target make consumer-centric decisions about our assortment, like the addition of 50 new F&B items for Easter and dozens more that we're launching just in time for the summer season, including a Favorite Day soda. Now it sounds simple, but the thoughtful, deliberate, holistic approach to designing, launching and managing our brands, it's the difference between rolling out catchall brands and the difference between that and building brands that consumers love because we're meeting their needs in a really meaningful way. \nA. Hennington: Well, thank you both. I love that, and that's a perfect note to close on, consumer centricity. That's a theme running through everything we've covered today, new brands like Gigglescape, Figmint and dealworthy. Our relaunched up & up and powerhouses like Gather and Cat & Jack. So thank you, Rick and Jill for that look into our owned brand work, it really is incredible.\n When I think about Target's right to win in this environment and our ability to meet key consumer needs, our owned brand is foundational to so many of our plans. That's because the investments we made in our capabilities and our team over more than 2 decades, combined to form competitive advantage that few retailers anywhere can match. And it's not just a competitive moat we're talking about here because we're not hunkering down, playing defense. This work is our springboard into the future.\n And through the incredible value we -- value our owned brands offer across each of our key categories, and the compelling newness they're adding to our entire assortment, we'll continue to deepen our relationships with our guests and will give all consumers compelling reasons to choose Target.\n Now I'll hand it off to Cara Sylvester, who will tell us more about how we're getting these products in front of consumers and engaging with our guests and potential guests more broadly. Thank you. Cara? \nCara Sylvester: Thanks, Christina, and hello, everyone. Today, I'm excited to talk about our guest experience. And you might ask Cara, how do we define guest experience at Target? Well, we think of it as the way we engage across America. From simply saying hello to consumers in a warm-Target way to deepening the relationships we have with existing Target guests, to how we create moments of discovery, connection and joy that invite people to choose Target again and again.\n But before we look back at the previous year and preview what's ahead, I want to ground us in a consumer point of view because to understand how Target designs its guest experience, we should start with how people are shopping today. As you heard from Christina gone are the days when people would follow a consistent and well-defined path from discovery to purchase. Today, shopping is nonlinear and simply a part of the general ecosystem of our lives.\n Instead of a stand-alone experience that feels planned or predictable, shopping has become immersive, always on and fully integrated into how we all go about our days. A large portion of U.S. consumers, about 40%, start their purchase online and 20% start on social platforms. And those are just the people who are actively looking to shop. Many more are enticed to shop by the inspiration they find scrolling their social feeds for hours every day. This is expansive retail, nontraditional entry points, seamless transition between stores, online and social and fully in tune with what shoppers want and need. To meet these shoppers where they are, we spend a lot of time getting to know what matters to them and seeing the Target experience through their eyes.\n Our guest base is broad and diverse. In fact, 96% of U.S. adults have shopped Target at some point in their life. Yet we know that your shopping experience in mind are going to look and feel very different based on a variety of factors. Our families, our interest, our budgets, our schedule and simply what brings us joy. Expectations also differ by category. If you're on a grocery run, you're looking for reliability and value. And if I'm shopping for one of my daughter's birthdays, I'm looking for inspiration and fun. These nuances are especially important for Target given our diverse multi-category portfolio. Yet even though your shop -- even though shopping journeys vary, after gathering feedback from millions of guests about what they care about and how Target fits into their lives, there are a few important truths that unite our guests and shape how we design our experience.\n First, Target guests love to shop. They consistently list shopping as one of their favorite activities, more so than your average consumer. 90% of guests tell us they're looking for quality products. They also want a meaningful connection with the brand, and they're ahead of the curve when it comes to keeping up with trends. Second, our guests are whenever-wherever-however shoppers, using multiple channels to create the experience that fits into their lives. They're in the driver's seat when it comes to creating the experience that works best for them. And we have to meet them where, when and how they need us.\n Finally, one more important factor that defines Target guests. They are loyal, really loyal. Our most engaged guest account for a greater share of sales than we see at other competitors. Showing that the connection we have with guests is sticky and drives growth and profitability. Quite simply, guests look to target for inspiration, to find on-trend, high-quality items at a great price and to have some fun. Are we affordable? Yes. Are we fast and convenient? Absolutely. Can you check off everything on your list no matter how you prefer to shop? You bet.\n But there are other retailers who can say the same. What makes Target different, what makes guests consistently choose us over any other retailer is how we make them feel when they interact with us. How we design our experience to elevate ordinary moments into extraordinary ones with a carefully curated assortment, bursts of discovery and delight and plenty of human connection along the way. \n There, of course, are the big splashes of the Target brand that grab headlines, generate buzz and make people smile. Like our Halloween Ghoul Lewis, who took the season by storm or the ugly squirrel sweater that we created in 48 hours to pay homage to the version worn by Taylor and Travis over the holidays or turning the Las Vegas Sphere into a huge holiday snow globe complete with Bullseye in resonance. But there are also millions of smaller everyday moments that strengthen the bonds we have with our guests making their lives a little bit easier and a little bit brighter.\n So when visiting one of our stores in San Antonio, Texas last year, I kept hearing about a team member who I needed to meet. In fact, even some guests stopped me and said, \"I absolutely needed to meet her.\" And they were right. She was somebody I absolutely needed to meet, and I wanted you to meet her too. Let me introduce you to Amelia.\n [Presentation] \nCara Sylvester: So I love that video because it captures who we are as a brand and what we aim to deliver across our entire guest experience. Our team brings so much empathy to their work. And it's not just the face-to-face interactions at checkout or in the aisles. Empathy is infused into how we design every part of the guest experience.\n Drive Up is a perfect example. The reason guests love Drive Up at Target because it's a -- service reflects what's most important to them. It's easy. Swing by, we'll bring out your order to you or even pick up your return. It's fast. Just tell us you're on your way. We'll be ready when you are, no pickup windows to worry about because we work on your schedule. It's fun at a Starbucks to make your trip that much more relaxing and it's all free. This is what we mean by designing an experience for our guests. Looking at a service through their eyes, using Target technology to rapidly iterate and introduce new capabilities and finding ways to not only meet their needs but add something extra to make their day. That's the Target experience.\n You saw that from us in 2023 as we continued on our path to be America's favorite discovery destination. Our stores are known as a getaway spot. Somewhere you can go and enjoy a few minutes or a few hours, browsing the aisles with friendly team members to help you find just what you need. We're bringing that same sense of exploration and relaxation to guests who walk through our digital front door. Last year, shoppers visited us more than 6 billion times on our digital channels, looking for the same warmth, newness and discovery that greets them when they walk into one of our front doors. In fact, more than half of guests who make a purchase in our stores have visited our app or our site that very same day, reinforcing how shoppers move fluidly from physical to online and back again.\n And Target is uniquely suited to be there for our guests when inspiration strikes because of our agile technology and the pathways we create between stores, digital, social, marketing and more. The experience we created this past holiday season is a great example. This year, there was clear connectivity across our experience to create a memorable and meaningful visit no matter how you choose to shop with us. Holiday gateways, in-store and online, digital gifting stations, product packaging to make you smile, in-store playlist to set the mood, festive TikTok content and Target Wonderland community pop-up events. These all work together to celebrate the holidays with our guests in a way that only Target can.\n Our ongoing investment in our digital capabilities enabled this year's fully connected holiday celebration. In 2023, we transformed our digital experience from a utilitarian shopping platform that was one-size-fits-all to one that is filled with warmth, greets you personally just like Amelia would and delivers a custom blend of newness, trend, value and ease just for you. And it's not just what the guests see but what's happening behind the scenes to power these personalized experiences. We're using generative AI to power our product detail pages to provide more friendly and relevant explanations of what guests want to know about our assortment.\n AI also powers features like shop the look and our get it now assistant, which lets you know when items in your cart are available for pickup at a nearby store. It's also the engine behind the insights we use to give guests more personal experiences and rewards through our loyalty program, Target Circle. And it's a key element of how we create thoughtfully curated campaigns for consumers through our advertising business, Roundel.\n This might be a good time to talk about how Roundel seamlessly integrates into the guest experience and continues to drive more than $1.5 billion in value for our business. Growing more than 20% in 2023, Roundel is the powerful bridge between our guests and the brands they love. Roundel works with more than 2,600 vendors to deliver creative that is resonant and wholly consistent with the Target experience. In return, our guests receive content that speaks directly to their interest and preferences. Take our holiday campaign with Apple.\n Tech products top many guests holiday gift list. So we worked with Apple on a comprehensive campaign to keep their products front and center for our guests this holiday season. With custom content designed to reach our guests across a number of platforms, including Connected TV, YouTube and social media. Our co-created holiday video ad made us the first Apple partner to highlight the new double tap feature on its Watch Series 9 in a spot. To add relevance, we used AI on our site to position the right products in the right moments. Think serving up promotions to RedCard holders, so they get the best deal plus extra 5% off by using their card or helping a guest find a perfect gift for their teenager, hint, go for the AirPods Pro.\n This integrated campaign tapped into our powerful ecosystem of digital, social, marketing and merchandising and absolutely resonated with shoppers. We deepened relationships with existing fans and attracted new ones with a significantly higher new guest rate compared to prior Apple campaigns at Target. In addition to the way Roundel powers the guest experience when guests are browsing our app or website unique to Target is our media mix with 35% of revenue being generated outside of our owned properties. That means that we're able to connect with consumers wherever they are, like on social or streaming platforms, driving more than 250 million visits to Target properties in 2023. \n And social is increasingly where our guests are. We have more followers than any other mass retailer on TikTok with incredibly high engagement, which underscores our opportunity to connect the love that guests have for us on social to a smooth path to purchase in stores and on our digital properties. Our guests use social to stay in touch with the latest trends in a way that feels specifically designed for them. So we're working across the spectrum of social, from user-generated content and Target creators to our talent partners and Target owned platforms to make it easier for guests to maintain that discovery mindset as they shop. \n Over the coming year, you'll see us experimenting to bring off-platform content on to our digital properties, so guests can find inspiration right on their sight in our app. And we'll blend social and commerce to create an experience that taps into real-time trends and makes off-line inspiration to online purchase intuitive and easy. So imagine a guest looking for just the right things for a housewarming celebration. They open our app, which is personalized just for them and type in housewarming party ideas. Using generative AI search, they see the latest products that fit their style and preferences, including delicious snacks from Good & Gather, cheap party supplies, modern glassware and even some new party outfits.\n We brought the fun of wandering the aisles of our stores alongside inspiration from lifestyle influencers to spark new finds, like beautiful living room decor. Our guest uses 3D visualization to see it in their space and AI-powered reviews to learn more. They love it and snap it up along with their must-have party supplies. Within a few hours, their haul arrives thanks to same-day delivery, they love the items so much. They share their finds on social media, inspiring other guests to shop Target.\n This is the future our teams are working on today, a seamless fluid shopping experience across stores, digital and social, and centered on what our guests want and need. And knowing what our guests want and need, deepening our connection with them and making millions of guests feel that every visit is made just for them is at the heart of our loyalty program Target Circle. We introduced the program in 2019 as a way to say thank you to guests with deals, rewards and perks. Today, we have more than 100 million members who have earned $2 billion in rewards. Members have told us how much they value the program, and it shows.\n Last year, they visited us 5x more often and spent 5x more than guests who aren't members of Target Circle, yet. And our personalized deals and bonus offers powered by our proprietary technology drove $1.5 billion in incremental sales last year. Yet members have also told us that it could be even easier to save and know how much they're saving. So we took this opportunity not just to improve our program but to reimagine how we think about loyalty across the entirety of our experience. So today, I am thrilled to introduce a new Target Circle, one that brings the best of Target together under one loyalty program. Here's a short video that we created to sum up with new and what's next.\n [Presentation] \nCara Sylvester: So bringing together Target Circle, Target Circle Card and Target Circle 360 simplifies and expands how we deliver value to our guests. And as we've been talking about, we've designed the program to give guests flexibility and control in how they shop. There's the Target Circle our guests know and love today that gives every member access to the best deals and rewards at Target. There's absolutely no cost to join. What's new is they can now shop target without having to search for and add offers. Deals are automatically applied at checkout, plus they'll continue to receive partner perks with Ulta Beauty and Apple and even more rewards through personalized bonuses based on their shopping behavior. For those guests who want to save even more, Target Circle Card offers an extra 5% off each trip. This is on top of the automatic savings they receive as Target Circle members, plus free 2-day shipping, extended time for returns and no annual fee.\n And with credit card, debit card or reloadable card options, consumers can find the product that's right for them. And finally, for those who want the magic of Target delivered to their door in as little as 1 hour, there's Target Circle 360, an extension of the same-day capabilities we've built since our acquisition of Shipt in 2017. Target Circle 360 members can order everything from groceries, to household essentials, to the newest must-have item with no additional fees, no markups and support from a preferred shopper. Members even have access to Shipt's multi-retailer marketplace, which gives them access to even more items from their favorite local stores. No waiting for days for boxes to arrive on your doorstep, just unlimited same-day delivery that we're rolling out to guests at the promotional price of $49, which will be the standard price for Target Circle cardholders. \n Guests will have access to the new Target Circle starting April 7 and we can't wait for them to feel the difference. This is just the beginning for Target Circle. Our AI-powered models will continue to deepen our relationship with guests and enable us to deliver one-on-one personalization at scale. And with this new foundation in place, we'll continue adding benefits and perks based on what matters most to our guests, like exclusive partnerships, product offers and more so they can get the most out of shopping at Target. This goes back full circle, pun intended to how people are shopping today. Shopping is dynamic and so are we. The investments we're making reflect our focus on consumers' preferences and needs, so we continue to be their first choice for discovery, delight and experiences that make them smile. \n That's Target's guest experience at its best, building connection and celebrating everyday moments in meaningful and memorable ways. Moving with our guests through their lives. So we're able to bring joy whenever we can. That's the Target magic, and it's what fuels our future. Now I'd like to welcome a familiar face with an expanded title to the stage, Michael Fiddelke. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Cara just mentioned, I've recently taken on a new role. And while I'll be staying on as CFO for a little while longer, I'm honored and excited to be leading our incredible operations team as Chief Operating Officer. As an engineer by training, I've always had a passion and respect for the work of my new team. And I've learned a lot working with them and alongside them during my 20-plus years at Target. As John Hulbert would tell you, over the years, I've often added complexity to our investor travel. So we could squeeze in just one more store visit.\n And throughout the recent holiday season and so far this new year, it's been great to have an opportunity to spend even more time with teams in both our stores and supply chain facilities. While our financial conversations often focus on the metrics we use to assess our performance, there's no substitute for seeing firsthand the strength of our operations, the benefits that come from well-managed inventory and newness and hearing our talented team is focused on building for the future. \n So before I move into the financial portion of my remarks, I'm going to spend a few minutes on my priorities as I move into this new role. And as I've mentioned to my new team, I'm coming into this job at a time when our operations are in a very strong position. As such, my top priority is to build on the foundation that John Mulligan and the team have already established, and I'm fortunate to have an outstanding group of leaders already in place. As you've heard from John over the years, the operations team is focused on advancing multiple long-term initiatives to expand our footprint, modernize how we support our business and advance our company strategy. These efforts begin with investments in our store network, developing new locations, remodeling existing ones, supporting key partnerships like Ulta Beauty, enhancing our same-day services and more.\n We're also transforming our supply chain. This includes our journey to automate upstream replenishment with a focus on reducing store workload and increasing reliability. It also includes the build-out of our sortation center network, which offers faster delivery times while meaningfully reducing the cost of last mile delivery. Beyond this investment in our infrastructure, we're partnering with teams across the company to enhance our inventory positioning and demand forecasting, leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance our speed, consistency and efficiency. And of course, we're focused on the support and development of our team, including their pay, benefits, training and well-being. As I've said consistently, during my time as CFO, our team is our most valuable asset, and I'm bringing that perspective into my new role.\n As Christina mentioned earlier, beginning last year, our team renewed their focus on retail fundamentals after several years of managing through unusually high volatility. These efforts focus first on in-stocks, but encompass a broad array of measures relating to guest experience. In total last year, our store teams rolled out new training on 25 separate best practices, and we've seen the benefit in our recent guest surveys. While those initial improvements are encouraging, we'll continue on that journey throughout this year to ensure we're setting the standard for the shopping experience in U.S. retail.\n So now let me turn to our financial results. And while our focus today is on the future, I'm also going to give a look back for perspective on our longer-term trajectory. I'll begin with a review of last year's financial performance and then compare and then examine how it compares with a decade ago. With that context, I'll look ahead to our aspirations over the next 10 years and conclude with our outlook for 2024. It's clear that last year was unusual as top line results came in below our guidance, but our bottom line performance came in well ahead of expectations. For the full year, we saw a 3.7% decline in our comparable sales, reflecting quarterly traffic trends that varied widely from the strongest performance in Q1 to the softest in Q2 and an improving trend in Q3 and Q4.\n As traffic improved, we saw a better comp sales trend, better digital sales and a dramatic improvement in discretionary categories. On the operating margin line, our business delivered dollar growth of nearly $2 billion last year, well beyond our initial guidance of $1 billion or more. This was driven by a rebound in our operating margin rate from historic lows in 2022, a year where we faced unusually high markdown rates, sky high freight and transportation costs and rising rates of inventory shrink. \n Last year, as the team managed inventory really well, markdown rates improved dramatically, and we saw a huge reduction in freight and transportation costs more than we expected as we entered the year. Healthy inventory levels also helped our operations, without the need to manage overfilled backrooms, store teams were able to flow product onto their sales floor more easily and increase their focus on guest-facing work.\n Similarly, our supply chain facilities were able to operate more smoothly without the necessary labor hours and extra touch is required to manage overly full buildings. Last year, we also benefited meaningfully from the efficiency efforts we launched about a year ago. When we began this work, we said we expected to realize $2 billion to $3 billion in permanent efficiency gains over a 3-year period. And with the first of those 3 years behind us, we continue to feel very good about our progress. More specifically, we estimate that these efforts delivered savings of more than $0.5 billion last year helping to offset other profit pressures, including the deleveraging effect of a soft top line, continued investments and paying benefits for our team and higher inventory shrink. And finally, last year, we continued to benefit from our Roundel ad business, which grew more than 20% in a year when we were facing challenging trends on the top line.\n Altogether, last year's profit performance led to growth in our GAAP and adjusted EPS of nearly $3 or just under 50% compared with the prior year. In addition, cash from operations more than doubled from $4 billion in 2022 to $8.6 billion last year. And finally, after-tax return on invested capital expanded by well over 3 percentage points from 12.6% in 2022 to 16.1% last year. \n Before I include my recap of 2023, I want to provide an update on inventory shrink, which includes the impact of retail theft. Last year, consistent with expectations, shrink cost increased more than $500 million compared with 2022, representing about 50 basis points of incremental rate pressure. Even more notable, compared with 2019, shrink costs have reduced our operating margin rate by a cumulative 1.2 percentage points over a 4-year period. \n Happily, we've seen some encouraging trends recently resulting from both the actions we've taken and the community efforts we're seeing across the country. I want to pause and give a quick shout out to our assets protection and information security teams who are working around the clock to protect the safety of our team and our guests. I'll add, however, that because it's a lagging metric, we're planning for shrink rates to remain approximately flat in 2024. So now with last year in the books, I want to briefly pull back the lens and look back over the last decade, which is a very long time in retail. This will help to highlight the journey we've been on and the capabilities we've developed serving as the foundation for the next decade of profitable growth. As you all know, the last 10 years were a time of rapid change in retail. \n This led to some sluggish results at Target in the early years as our business faced some significant challenges. Those periods were followed by rapid progress in later years based on the steps we took to address those challenges. Let's start with the top line. In 2013, our U.S. business generated about $71 billion in sales, while 2023 sales were about $34.5 billion higher, representing an average growth rate of about 4% per year, breaking down that growth by channel, about $16.5 billion occurred in our stores, while digital sales grew by another $18 billion becoming nearly 13x larger over that decade.\n Within our digital sales, same-day services, which didn't exist 10 years ago, accounted for $12.5 billion or 70% of our digital growth between 2013 and 2023. On the bottom line, our adjusted EPS in the U.S. grew by an average of about 7.6% per year from $4.29 in 2013 to $8.94 last year, while GAAP EPS from continuing operations grew slightly faster. \n On top of those EPS gains, our per share dividend grew at an average rate of 10.7% per year from $1.58 in 2013 to $4.36 last year. I'd note that these bottom line returns were delivered during a decade in which our operating profitability experienced a meaningful amount of compression from a 6.7% operating margin rate in 2013 to 5.3% last year. As we experienced significant pressure from inventory shrink and higher digital penetration. Going forward, we expect to offset at least a portion of this decline over time as we work to achieve an optimal and sustainable operating margin rate.\n Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities have remained consistent for decades. So I'll briefly reiterate them here. We first look to reinvest capital in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our 52-year record of annual increases in the dividend per share. And finally, we deploy any excess cash after these first two uses to repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. Over the last decade, our operations generated just over $67 billion of cash. And during that time, the lowest level of any single year was still more than $4 billion. These cash returns demonstrate the durability of our business as we navigated through several challenging periods over those 10 years. \n They also give us a lot of confidence in our prospects for making continued productive investments in the years ahead. Throughout that entire decade, deployment of cash was consistent with our long-term priorities. Just over $30 billion was devoted to CapEx, accounting for about 45% of the total. Another $14.5 billion was paid as dividends and cumulative share repurchases accounted for the remainder of just over $22 billion as we retired more than 206 million shares at an average price of about $108, all while maintaining our Middle A ratings over the entire period.\n So now with that long-term look back as context, I want to turn to what we expect to achieve over the next 10 years, beginning with the top line, where we're focused on 3 separate growth drivers: comparable sales, new stores and other revenue. Comps are expected to be the primary source of growth with increases in the low to mid-single-digit range in a normal year, consistent with our average over the last decade. We'll support this comp growth with continued investments in our business in remodels, own brands, national brands, signature partnerships and value-added services across all channels.\n Turning to remodels. We plan to invest in the vast majority of our nearly 2,000 store fleet over the next 10 years. Each year, projects will range from full-scale remodels in which we touch the entire store to more surgical investments, including the addition of Ulta Beauty locations, fixture upgrades, support of our same-day services and more. On top of existing stores, we'll continue opening new locations based on the strong financial returns they generate. \n As Brian mentioned, most of these new stores will be larger on average than we've opened in recent years. Based on the opportunities we've already identified, we expect to open more than 300 additional stores over the next decade, meaningfully extending our reach into new neighborhoods. By the end of those 10 years, we expect those new stores will be generating incremental sales of around $15 billion annually.\n Beyond our buildings, we'll continue to focus on the well-being of our team members who enable our growth and serve as the face of Target every day. As Christina and Cara highlighted earlier, the human element as exemplified by our team as a continued differentiator for Target in a world where commerce is becoming increasingly mechanized and impersonal. Finally, over the next decade, we expect to continue seeing outsized growth in other revenue. This has been driven in recent years by our Roundel ad business, which contributed more than $1.5 billion of value to Target last year to the benefit of both gross margin and other revenue. On top of Roundel, we also expect our digital marketplace, Target Plus, to make a more meaningful contribution over the next 10 years.\n Putting this all together, over the next decade, we expect our total revenue will grow by an average rate of roughly 4% per year over the next 10 years. If we attain that goal, our business will add more than $50 billion of revenue on top of the $107 billion we delivered in 2023. That growth will enable our business to further benefit from scale efficiencies as we continue to extend our reach in the U.S. market. On the operating margin line, our ambition is to reach the optimal rate to maximize profit dollar growth over time. While we don't yet know what that rate will be, we believe it will be at least the size our prepandemic rate of 6%. We made enormous progress and moving back towards 6% last year and expect to make continued progress in 2024 and beyond.\n Once we reach that 6% milestone, we'd be happy to continue moving higher as long as we're seeing appropriate dollar growth. For example, if we're successful in reducing shrink over the next few years, that might support our ability to sustainably operate above 6% over time. Regarding CapEx, we don't apply a rule of thumb to determine annual spending. Rather, we maintain a bottom-up plan and allocate capital to all the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. As you've seen in recent years, annual CapEx will vary based on the external backdrop and individual project investments, which naturally follow the evolving needs of the business will vary as we snap this chalk line in a specific year.\n For example, while in 2022, we needed to rapidly expand our upstream replenishment capacity. We're no longer feeling that same urgency today. Similarly, while we love what we're seeing in our sortation centers and expect to meaningfully grow their capacity over time, the pacing of sort center investments has slowed somewhat in the near term given the brown box last mile delivery volumes declined significantly last year. When we put together all of those considerations, along with our long-term growth ambitions, we believe annual CapEx will typically range between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2025 and beyond. Regarding our second capital priority, we expect to continue growing the per share dividend over the next decade and we'll manage the rate of annual increases with a goal of reaching a 40% payout ratio over time.\n As for our third capital priority, we expect share repurchases will continue to play a meaningful role in our EPS growth in years ahead. Our strong balance sheet successfully absorbed a number of powerful shocks in 2022. And last year, we made significant progress in moving our debt metrics back to appropriate levels. This sets the stage for a potential resumption and repurchase activity later this year. Altogether, we believe we can deliver high single-digit growth in earnings per share in a typical year, at or above the average you've seen over the last 10 years. And lastly, we believe our after-tax ROIC can continue to move higher into the teens over the next decade -- into the high teens over the next decade. \n So now let me turn briefly to our expectations for 2024. On the top line, we're still planning cautiously, given the consumer spending patterns we've seen for 2 full years now. More specifically, on the discretionary side of our business, even as we've seen improving trends over the last 2 quarters, overall demand remains soft as spending patterns continue to normalize from pandemic peaks. In our frequency businesses, we're anticipating a further recovery in unit trends this year as inflation continues to moderate. Altogether, we're planning for a modest increase in comparable sales in the 0% to 2% range for the year. Within the year, our top line will face the highest hurdle in the first quarter, while over the remainder of the year, we'll be comparing over notably softer results. As a result, while we're looking to build on the momentum we've seen in recent quarters, our plans anticipate a comp decline in the first quarter. \n After that, we're planning for a resumption of top line growth over the remaining 3 quarters of the year. On the operating margin line, we expect the impact of inventory shrink will be roughly flat to last year. In addition, given our cautious top line expectations and continued investments in long-term growth, we'll likely see some deleveraging on the SG&A line. In terms of tailwinds, we're planning for modest improvement -- modest rate improvement in shipping and transportation as we annualize the benefit of the lower rate contracts negotiated throughout 2023. We're also planning for continued outsized growth in our Roundel ad business, contributing to both gross margin and other revenue. And of course, we expect our efficiency work will benefit both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates.\n Altogether, in 2024, we're planning for a modest increase from last year's 5.3% operating margin rate as we continue moving towards our 6% goal. On the bottom line, our 2024 expectations translate to a full year range for both GAAP and adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60. On first glance, the midpoint of this range represents growth of just under 2% versus 2023. However, I'd note that it's equivalent to a mid- to high single-digit increase on a 52- to 52-week basis, given that last year had an extra week. Regarding the first quarter, our full year plans translate to a range of $1.70 to $2.10 for both GAAP and adjusted EPS on an expected 3% to 5% decline in comparable sales. \n Turning to our balance sheet and capital deployment. We continue to expect a CapEx range of $3 billion to $4 billion for the year and are planning for another strong year of cash generation. Later in the year, we'll recommend that our Board approved another increase in our per share dividend. And finally, while we don't expect to repurchase any shares in Q1, we may be able to resume that activity later in the year within the limits of our Middle A ratings. As I get ready to close, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team with a particular call out to my colleagues in finance. It's been an honor to serve as your Chief Financial Officer for the last 4.5 years. Just as I have been, I'm confident my successor will be incredibly grateful for the leadership, integrity, passion and discipline you bring to your work every day. \n Until a successor is named, I'll continue to fully occupy the CFO role and partner with all of you on behalf of Target and our stakeholders. To my new team, I'm incredibly excited to be working with all of you. As I said earlier, our operations are already in great shape, and I'm fortunate to be working with a strong set of leaders. I can't wait to see what we can accomplish together as we build and sustain the foundation for another decade of profitable growth at Target. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, thank you. As we get ready to take your questions, I might get started with some of the questions I can imagine are on your mind this morning. First, are the updates we shared enough to get Target back to growth? The answer is absolutely. We're confident that the road map we've outlined today puts our core strengths, capabilities and points of difference to work in new ways with even greater value, relevance, ease for our current guests and U.S. consumers more broadly. This road map will help us meet consumers where they are to drive traffic, profitable sales growth, and long-term market share gains.\n Another question might be, can Target keep building on the profit improvement you put up last year. You just heard it for Michael, nearly $2 billion in 2023 of operating income growth, far outpacing our guidance. More than $0.5 billion in cost savings from our ongoing efficiency efforts, giving us a fast start on our multiyear efficiency goals and realistic expectations for additional improvement in our operating margin rate this year as we move towards our 6% goal. Ultimately, I'm sure you're asking, what does this mean for shareholders over time? And that brings us back to our emphasis on long-term horizons and the durability of our business model.\n Again, you heard it from Michael. From 2013 to 2023, revenue grew by almost 50%, while earnings per share and the annual dividend more than doubled. The progress we made last year in shifting the momentum of our business, defining our road map for growth and improving our profit performance has set us up to resume share repurchase, potentially later this year. We know that's been an important source of shareholder returns over time. But since most of you know our capital priorities as well as we do at this point, I'm guessing you noticed that I'm ending with the priority that's been on top of the list for decades. Simply put, investing in the right strategies and capabilities for our consumers and our business is a surest way to deliver outstanding shareholder returns over decades.\n As you've seen in the last decade, there's a lot we can't control in the operating environment, but we are in charge of our financial decisions and the business plans and investments that drive our performance. We know that if we perform well for consumers, their market will reward investors who are fueling those efforts. That's why you've seen us highlight our road map this morning. It reflects our team's eagerness to grow, and more importantly, our plan to execute on that ambition. It's how we're putting the assets and capabilities we've built in the last decade to work in ways that are inspiring and in step with how consumers will be shopping in the next decade. \n Keep in mind strengths that are unique to us, a comprehensive competitive position, a position that's difficult to replicate because no one can put it all together like Target. We've said it before, it's the power of [ brand ], from our stores and digital experiences to our fulfillment options, our multi-category portfolio, our signature brand partnerships, our own brand [indiscernible] and above all, our global team. Our 400,000 Target team members and a talented and dedicated and determined leadership team, who have led and will keep leading our team through go time. But make no mistakes, everyone at Target from the check lane to the C-suite is committed to the next era of grow time. Now we look forward to hearing from you. I'll ask Christina, Cara and Michael to join me back on stage so we can take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \nBrian Cornell: Hands are going up, why don't we start right here? \nSimeon Gutman: Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. My first question is on the buying discipline. So Target makes a lot of its profit on discretionary products. Do you think you've developed new muscle over the last year or so? Or you just reacted to the environment and we'll see some of this go back? \nBrian Cornell: Christina, I think that's a great place to start. And you can talk about the work we've done with our global sourcing teams to make sure we are evolving the way we buy goods across the country. \nA. Hennington: Yes. Thank you for the question. We have evolved significantly over the last 1.5 years plus. What we've been living through over the last couple of years really has been quite unprecedented. And the opportunity has been to infuse more agility and flexibility into our model. So in 2023, we bought with an intention of [ placing bets ] on the things that we were most excited about, innovation, newness, our own brands, where we saw the business trends were. But we also wanted to make sure that we created flexibility in the model. And so overall, we certainly bought less in those down-trending categories to manage the inventory. But by buying less led to swifter operations, ease and just clarity in how to operate within this environment. We were also able to introduce levers through dual sourcing capabilities, a country of production diversification having more domestic backup.\n So in categories like apparel, where it's really important that we're on trend and we're able to get things that we need quickly based on what we're seeing in the market. We have increased our flexibility levers manyfold and are using reserve open to buy basically receipts that we haven't spend as well as other flexibility levers to buy into the things that are working. And it is really paying off. Not only did we manage our inventory levels significantly lower and led to significantly increase in stocks, the best we've had in 4 years as well as being able to chase into the things that matter. Our apparel business is perhaps the best example of that, where we've seen green shoots of acceleration quarter-by-quarter. And not totally visible when you look at the aggregate comp, our discretionary comps were the best in the fourth quarter. They were better than in the first quarter. So we've seen that discretionary comp acceleration through the year. That's what we plan to build on in 2024. \nBrian Cornell: I'd only add that even in 2023, as we took a more conservative approach in discretionary categories, Christina, Rick and Jill's teams certainly leaned into key seasonal moments to make sure that we had the right newness, the right affordability as guests continue to celebrate those key seasonal moments. We'll do more of that in 2024 as we continue to make sure we adjust our flexibility to meet the needs of guests as they continue to change their shopping patterns. Let's go over on the side. Michael. \nMichael Lasser: I have 2 questions. One, seems like if we were to characterize the strategy today, it would be remodel the stores, introduce new products, leverage some of the relationships that you have with your customers through a reintroduced Circle program. You have a lot of experience with those strategies. Is it right for us to think that each one of those could contribute 100 basis points to your comp, and that's how you build to getting low to mid-single-digit comp over the long term? \n And then a more near-term question. You're guiding to 3% to 5% comp decline for the first quarter, flat to up 2%. How do you go from point A to point B? And how have you factored in some of the uncertainties like changes in credit card fees and the overall uncertain environment, given that there's an election year in the year ahead. \nBrian Cornell: I'm happy to start, Michael. And we're not going to provide you the waterfall today that breaks all those components apart, but everything you've talked about is baked into our plans. We certainly expect new stores to be a major contributor as we go forward. Michael talked about, over a decade, we expect those 300 new stores to generate about $15 billion of incremental revenue. We'll continue to invest in remodels. And we've got a long track record of seeing those remodels deliver really good returns. \n We'll continue to lean into our own brands, our national brands and those great brand partnerships to make sure we're providing our guests with the newness and inspiration they're looking for. We're very excited. As you heard from Cara about the new Target Circle program, the benefits of that base program, circle card and the excitement around Target 360 and how that will extend our same-day offering to guests, bring it right to their home within an hour. \n So each one of those elements play a key role. We're very excited about the enhancements we've made from an overall digital standpoint to provide more ease and inspiration and discovery for our guests. And both Michael and Cara talked about the upward potential we see in Roundel. So they'll all play a key role as we go forward. But I think it fundamentally starts with us understanding consumer trends, how consumers are shopping today and we'll shop differently going forward and continue to meet their needs, no matter how they want to shop with Target. Either in a physical store, in a digital environment, whether it starts with social or they're just walking into a great neighborhood Target store. So each element is going to contribute to our road map for growth. \n And underneath all of that is that continued focus on retail fundamentals, the blocking and tackling that makes sure we provide our guests a great physical and digital experience, making sure we're always in stock that we leverage our crux, that we provide great affordability and we're there to provide a great guest experience no matter how you shop with our brand. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. And maybe just add on that by kind of reinforcing a point Brian made. I love the fact you can't decompose our strategy and to discrete things. It's how they work together, a guest engaging with circle that finds discretionary category discovery within that experience. And so it's never 1 plus 1 equals 2. We're hoping 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 10. And it's how all of it comes together. You asked a question specifically on the cadence as we move through the year. I touched on it a little bit in my remarks, we anniversaried some of the strongest business last year in Q1, and so we would expect to see a build as we move through 2024. \nBrian Cornell: How about right back here. \nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli with the Truist. Can you guys provide any more color on your most recent shrink results? And can you help us understand what happens with the sales velocity of products when you put them behind lock and key? \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Michael, I'm happy to start because I know it's a topic on everyone's mind. And when I think about shortage, when I think about shrink, I'll start with the word progress. I think we're seeing really solid progress and greater awareness at the national, state and local level. And certainly, our teams have been working to ensure we provide a great guest experience and provide an experience that's safe for our team and safe for our guests. And Michael, I think our teams have made significant progress, but a lot more to come. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I mean I can't say enough about the hard work of the teams that have led to that ton of progress that Brian hit on. And the way that rolls into our [indiscernible] is we're expecting shrink to be flat year-over-year. We learned a lot in the first quarter. We inventory a lot of stores in Q1, and so it will be smarter a quarter from now. But that progress has us expecting for a lagging metric flat, and we'll see what we've learned as we go through the year. \nBrian Cornell: All right. Just roll it back here. \nMichael Baker: Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson. I wanted to talk about your efficiency efforts in the $500 million that you achieved this year. How do we think about that over the next few years? Is that linear? Does it sort of get sort of roll down hill and get better? What is assumed in your 2024 outlook. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Well, I'm happy to start. The teams work against a tough top line to deliver that efficiency progress this year. It's a great start, and I can view that as a down payment toward that $2 billion to $3 billion that we expect to get over time. The things are a little closer in that were highlights of that this year. I'd call out the continued benefits of something like our sortation centers. We have a sortation center in a market ,we're faster and we're cheaper than other forms of delivery. \n I also -- I mean we touched on a little bit in the conversation already, but it warrants another shout out. The benefit of exceptionally well-managed inventory just shows up everywhere. We're so much more productive in-store and in our DCs when inventory is well managed. And so I feel really good about the team's work there in 2023. I feel great about our inventory position as we step into 2024. And I would expect our teams to continue taking the growth we've seen and the growth we expect and to translate that more into more efficiencies over time. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Michael, I'd only add that taking a very measured approach to setting priorities year-by-year. We see opportunities in stores, in supply chain, opportunities to better leverage technology to continue to build on that efficiency road map. So year after year, we'll reset priorities to make sure we're laser-focused on delivering those results, and they'll build over time. All right. Back over here. \nDaniela Bretthauer: Danny Bretthauer with HSBC. Question to Cara on the new Target Circle program. I mean, is $49, obviously, like an introductory price? How long are you willing to sustain at the price level? Because I think it's hard to make the math with same day 1 hour delivery at $49 and how do you plan to compete with the other programs, loyalty programs out there? What would be some of the key differentiators other than this entry $49 price point. \nBrian Cornell: Cara, I'll let you take it away. \nCara Sylvester: Take it away. We're really excited to talk about it. And I think it's really important that we really anchor on the entire Target Circle ecosystem. That was really important to us. And the notion of accessibility and for all is really, really important. That's why we first are reimagining how we're thinking about delivering value. Our guests are really clear. They want value, affordability and they want ease and so we're making it even easier for our 100 million members to actually be able to get the deals and rewards that they want with automatic savings applied at checkout. I'll hit on your question around pricing in just a minute, but I think it's really important to talk about our cardholders as well. Today, the cardholders, that program doesn't work with Target Circle. And so what we're doing is we're actually bringing these 2 things together. \n So that not only do you get 5% off every trip, and extended returns and free shipping, you also get all the benefits of the base Target Circle program, which are those deals that our guests love and those personalized rewards that are based specifically on your shopping behavior. The other thing that we're adding for our cardholders is an evergreen price of $49 for Target Circle 360. So if you are a cardholder for us, always on price will be $49, which is an amazing price, and it's less than $1 a week of the magic of Target delivered to your door. \n For Target Circle 360, we're really excited to build on our strength in same-day delivery since our acquisition of Shipt in 2017, you will get the magic of Target delivered to your door in less than an hour. You'll also have access to the Shipt marketplace of benefits. You will also have access to all of those deals and rewards and personalized perks as part of the base Circle program. It's just the beginning for us, that $49 is an introductory promotional price for Target Circle 360. \nBrian Cornell: I just want to take this moment and I hope many of our leaders back home are listening and just thank the Circle team, the teams have been working on this program for months and months. Our tech teams have been supporting them and the entire effort that the organization has put behind bringing this forward today. As you can doubt, we are really excited about the future Target Circle and think it's going to be a major growth driver and deepen guest relevance and bring new consumers into the target franchise. All right. Back up front. \nGregory Melich: It's Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. I had 2 questions. One was, Michael, could you just -- you said Roundel will be up again. I think it was 20% last year. For guidance this year, are you thinking that offsets any pressure on credit and just tell us how credit is going? \n And then my other question goes back to traffic, great to hear all the initiatives in the Target Circle. In the guidance, what are we thinking about with AUR and average ticket, given that it is a value-focused consumer. We heard all the products that are under $10 and all this. So in that 0 to 2 comp, how much would traffic be up 3 while AUR is down, something like that? \nMichael Fiddelke: So if I start with the questions on the credit side of things, we've seen -- I think we've characterized it throughout the year, kind of an expected return to normal in a lot of those underlying credit metrics. And so you've seen a little bit of softness year-over-year there. Then in 2023, was offset nicely and then some by the incredible growth we've seen in the Roundel business. And as a reminder, I think I said this twice in remarks, Roundel is both a little other revenue and a lot of gross margin. And so it benefits 2 places to get to that $1.5 billion of value in total. But we've seen outsized growth there, and we would expect that to continue this year. We're really confident about our prospects to continue growing our Roundel business to the benefit of the guest that get strong engagement with all of those offers. \n Another example of how the strategy fits together, the more engagement we have with Circle, the better we know our guests. The better we know our guests, the better we can serve them through Roundel. And so we're excited about what growth looks like there. Your second question, Greg, refresh my memory? \nUnknown Executive: Traffic. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, we won't break out ticket versus traffic. But the theme I'll talk about that we've seen this year is a moderation of inflation, I think, but disinflation is the word of the quarter in retail. That's a good thing for the consumer. You've heard it for the consumer. You've heard us talk about that being one of the inputs, some share of wallet recovery on the discretionary side of things. And so we're pleased to see that ticket pressure because we think it's a good thing for the U.S. consumer. \nEdward Yruma: Ed Yruma, Piper Sandler. You spent much of the last decade kind of opening 8 typical stores, small boxes, urban locations, and it sounds like you're pivoting back to kind of traditional large boxes and ostensibly suburban areas. Would love to understand kind of what that small box portfolio looks like? Have you been pleased with the returns, given some of the changes in the urban dynamic? And then as you look to these larger stores, how should we think about the role of food in some of these bigger boxes? \nBrian Cornell: Ed, it's a great question. I'm happy to start. And actually, over the last couple of years, you've seen us move from a focus on small stores, and we can talk about the performance there to more larger-sized stores as we see new opportunities and catchments where we haven't competed in the past. And we've been very pleased with the performance of these new full-size stores as well as the continued performance in urban centers and on college campuses. \n So as we look at our pipeline going forward, we recognize there's opportunities for more full-size stores, extend our proximity, bring the best of Target into some new trading areas. And as part of that, you will see us continue to expand our food and beverage offering. Rick talked about the progress we've seen in food and beverage and adding over $8 billion in the last couple of years and the strength of a brand like Good & Gather and for many of you who are tracking the consumer packaged goods industry, there aren't a lot of $4 billion brands out there. \n And we launched that brand just prior to the pandemic. And we just continue to see the steady growth and how our guests react to the quality and value we bring with Good & Gather. So we're excited about the pipeline. It will be more larger-sized stores. There will be a broader food offering. And we're going to be moving into trade areas where we can pick up incremental volume and market share because we, in many cases, just haven't competed in these trade areas in the past. Michael, do you want to talk about some of the returns we're seeing with some of our smaller stores. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, we feel really good about the returns of those small stores. And it's great to have that flexibility in kind of our toolbox of what's the right thing to build for the opportunity in a specific market. And to be clear, going forward, if the right opportunity can be fit with a 25,000 square foot box that brings us closer to a college campus or an urban center. We know how to do that. We like the returns, and we'll lean in there. But as we step back, and look at what that pipeline looks like in total. It's actually the big box stores where we're able to bring the best of Target that are bubbling to the top in terms of where we expect returns to be strongest. And so we'll lean in to that shift over time. And if our properties team was here on the stage with us, they could roll out a map of the U.S. and show a bunch of main and main locations where we'd love to bring Targets to new communities, and we feel good about what that pipeline looks like. \nBrian Cornell: And I'd add 3 more points as we think about small formats. And we're here in Manhattan. 10 years ago, we really didn't have a brand presence in Manhattan. Today, we have over a dozen locations, and we're in many of the different neighborhoods across the city. We've now been connecting with a consumer that we couldn't reach in the past. And we're going to build a long-term relationship there. We're on many college campuses across the country. We know the value of building a connection with college students while they're on campus and the lifelong benefits that's going to provide for our brand as they move into their first apartment or have their first child and start their families. And one of the other things like Christina build on it is the work we've done with smaller formats has allowed us to understand a lot more about segmentation and getting the assortment right geography by geography. \n So as we move into new markets, we're going to get much better at segmentation, having the right assortment that reflects the demand in those local markets. So there have been 3 really important benefits of our small format journey. We're touching new cities where we didn't have our presence in the past. We'll build a lifelong connection with college students, and we've learned a lot more about segmenting our assortment. \nA. Hennington: Yes. The only thing I'd add, even the lifelong relationship with college students, you heard Jill be very intentional. We actually seek to make sure that we are really relevant at certain life stages, especially early on in our consumers' lives. Think about the strength that we have in a business like baby, then we migrate them to toys, then we migrate them into video games and/or into juniors. And then having then presence, we do very well at back-to-school and back-to-college time frames. It's very intentional in making sure that our brand stays in touch with families through every life stage. College is the natural next step in that phase and then, of course, back to childbirth. So afterwards. And so that's been very intentional, but then to build back on segmentation opportunities yes, we've learned a lot. I mean, these boxes are small. They're difficult to operate. \n We certainly have to cut the SKU count intensively, and we have to study the macro -- or the micro environment of competitors. And so this ability to formulate the right assortment strategy for that community has taught us a lot about the potential to expand that further into our larger size boxes. And we see tons of upside and potential in more sophisticated segmentation and allocation strategies that allow us to optimize the local potential. \nBrian Cornell: Cara, one of the things you and I talked a lot is as we open up new stores, there's certainly a physical store component. We drive a lot of new revenue. But there's also benefits from a digital standpoint as we introduce the brand to new communities, you want to expand on some of the things we've learned. \nCara Sylvester: Absolutely. We see -- we talk a lot about digital influence sales. We know how consumers are shopping today. And so many of us, right, are starting, even if you love shopping and only purchase in stores, you're using our app to check out what's new, to see if something is in stock, et cetera. So we understand the power of digitally influenced store sales. What we also see, though, is the power of store influenced digital sales because we know some guests are browsing in stores and actually are pulling up their app right while they're in the store and having impact digitally. \n We certainly also see as we enter new markets, the power of our same-day services. That has been a shining star for us across the entire digital portfolio. I talked in my remarks about why that is in terms of the relationship that we have. And once guests try our same-day services, they love it. It is sticky in their lives. We are literally making their lives better. So we'll continue to build on that. But that's another great example. \nBrian Cornell: All right. We've got time for a couple more questions. Let's go up here. \nRobert Drbul: It's Bob Drbul, Guggenheim Securities. I just wondered if we could spend a few minutes on gross margin, maybe Q4 buckets and the performance detail around that, your assumptions in '24 for the full year. And then curious if you could share the financial implications, especially around gross margin on Target 360 your assumptions for the rollout for this year? \nBrian Cornell: Well, Michael, this is a surprise. We've made it all the way to the last few minutes of our conference today, and this is the first time we've had a question about gross margin. \nMichael Fiddelke: Excited to get the question as always. We'll, I can start by unpacking a little bit what we saw in Q4, and there's some consistent themes to what we saw in the broader part of the year because the theme of gross margin recovery this year. And I think Q4 and the year, we were just shy of 3 percentage points of improvement in gross margin. Better inventory management, we saved a lot of markdowns and costs that were associated with some of the inventory challenges that we had a couple of years ago.\n So on a year-over-year basis, that's a big source of improvement. Within there too, freight and transportation is in a much better place today from a cost perspective, not all the way back to 2019 levels, but on a year-over-year basis, another significant source of improvement. In addition, we also see benefit from digital and supply chain to the tune of, I think, 50 basis points in the right direction for the quarter and the year. \n And that's a combination of being more productive as inventory levels have been better managed and a little bit of tailwind from fewer brown boxes shipped with our brown box business being down on a year-over-year basis. As we look ahead to next year, all of our best assumptions are wrapped into the EPS guidance we've given. And a little bit of deleveraging, given a cautious view on the top line with some continued improvement in gross margin, we think is going to be the right recipe going forward.\n  When it comes to a Target Circle instead of speaking to any specific assumption within that business case, I think of Target Circle is about growth. When we meet our guests with the right value proposition in a free loyalty program and the right value proposition and Target delivered to your doorstep through Target 360 and if you're looking for 5% more every day, we've got to Target Circle card for you. All of that is about stronger relevancy in growth. \n And so the line of the P&L, I'm most excited about from a Target Circle standpoint is growth. And time and time again, if we think about the P&L through the lens of the guests, we get to the right decisions. It costs us a little bit more to serve a Drive Up order than it does an in-store trip. But when guests start using Drive Up, we've described it before, it continues to be true. They spend 20% to 30% more at Target thereafter. And so we're making decisions with what we think drives the most value and growth in total. \nBrian Cornell: Okay. Go back here. \nIvan Feinseth: Ivan Feinseth, Tigress Financial Partners. Congratulations on the great results out this morning. I have 3 questions. First, Cara, in thinking about like store layout and remodel, like, for example, in my local Target, food is on like the left side, but yet cookware is all the way on the other side of the store. And sometimes when I'm purchasing food, I find the need, I may need some cookware to do the dish I'm looking to cook. As an example. \n Second is information that you get from using Shipt where a Shipt customer will go outside to other retailers? How much do you take on that information to decide what you're going to carry in the stores? And then if they're using, let's say, buying premium brand, how high of a premium product point do you see yourself going because there are some of your competitors that are using value priced food to bring in customers, but those customers are buying premium priced products. \n And then third, on the partnership, what other areas do you see? And how far of a premium level would you go in adding partnerships within your store? \nCara Sylvester: There's a lot there. \nBrian Cornell: So Cara, why don't you start with partnerships? And Christina, why don't you talk about some of the learning that we have around how we build assortments? \nCara Sylvester: Absolutely. And so as I think about the introduction of Target Circle 360, we are absolutely looking at a wide range of what partnerships could look like to add benefits. Importantly, though, we are always going to be listening to our guests. That is how we actually struck up our conversation and partnership with Ulta Beauty as well as what we offer in our base program today with Apple. And so we'll be guests led, not Target led as we think about the types of partnerships that will add value to our guest lives. I do want to hit on specifically your question around Shipt. We do not leverage any data of Shipt on their marketplace internally at Target as we think about our assortment. \nA. Hennington: More specifically on how we build assortment and premium prices to answer some of your questions. Our goal is to make sure that we are meeting our guests' needs across a wide range of shopping occasions. And so we look at -- you heard us describe this especially when we talk about [ own brands ], right? We look for unmet need spaces and white spaces to innovate against. \n Over the last year, we've spent a lot of time making sure that we have our value equation shored up. And the introduction of dealworthy is a big deal for us. It is an opening price point brand across the entirety of the portfolio outside of food and beverage, where we already have Market Pantry. So just make sure we really have value options for all consumers so that they can meet their budgets. On the flip side, we do really well with Ulta Beauty, which is premium beauty. \n And it's based on the insight that we've known for years in beauty, almost all beauty shoppers shop both. They shop mass and they start to shop premium. And for us to be able to service the guests and service all the trips in that category, we needed a solution [ for growth ], which allowed us to build this partnership with Ulta, which we're really, really happy about. And we do that across the -- we do that across the portfolio to say where is the opportunity for Target to serve a unique need and where are the unmet needs in the category. And our guest has given us a lot of freedom to say, I'll spend $600 on this item. And by the way, I don't want to spend more than $2 on my body wash. And that's fine, whatever works for them. \nBrian Cornell: I'll just finished up that discussion by saying, I think we've learned time and time again. We make really good decisions when we listen to the guests and listen to the broader consumer trends. Some of the things we rolled out recently. Starbucks for our Drive Up guest. We didn't come up with that. They was the guest saying, \"Well, if Target could only provide me with my favorite Starbucks product, I'd enjoy this drive experience even more.\" If you could take my returns, I would really be pleased. So we respond to what the guests and the consumer tells us, and that's going to guide us for years to come. All right. We've got time for one final question. So I guess we're going right over here. \nChristopher Horvers: Chris Horvers, JPMorgan. So I have 2 questions. The first question, as you think about the performance in the fourth quarter, how do you think about share. Do you think it's more give back from the COVID pump? Do you think it's the consumers just so focused on food and value and you're just not getting the trip, so it's not resonating to the power of the target box. And how do you think about recapturing that share going forward? \n And then my second question is for Michael, as you look at like just the seasonality of your business, it seemed to imply -- you're implying a step down in operating margin in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, was there anything unique either in the fourth quarter or the first quarter that making that the case? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, why don't you start with the second half, and I'll wrap up with Chris' first question. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. So as we look at the first quarter, I think the key thing there is our cautious approach on the top line, and there's some differences year-over-year in what we anniversary, but that's a source of pressure in the first quarter. As we get back to growth, deeper in the year, we'll see some of that pressure subsides. So that's the headline on that one, Chris. \nBrian Cornell: And Chris, from a market share standpoint, I can assure everyone here, we look at market share in a very granular way every single week across our entire portfolio. And we're going to be very focused on taking market share as we go forward. I'll step back, not just look at the last year, but the last several years. And if I go all the way back to the prepandemic, we've added billions and billions of dollars of revenue growth. I think, Michael, over $30 billion. \n And we've deepened our relationship with guests along the way. We've added more capabilities and features. We've deepened partnerships. And those are going to guide us to be even a more relevant retailer and partner for consumers and guests for years to come. So we are very focused right now over not just the next year, but the next 10 years, to continue to drive even more traffic to our stores and visit store site to make sure we are a company that's driving top line growth because we know that's the best way to reward our shareholders. \n And we are absolutely going to be razor-focused on taking market share as we go forward. And sitting here today, we know there are significant opportunities across virtually every aspect of our portfolio, whether it's the work that Jill is leading and apparel and home or the work Rick is doing from a food and beverage standpoint and a beauty and essential standpoint, whether it's physical stores or digital, we see a pathway for continued market share growth, and we'll look at that every single week and talk about it every quarter because we know that's critically important to our road map for growth. \n So I appreciate everyone who joined us in person today. Those of you who have joined us through the video and the conference. Thanks so much. We look forward to seeing you and hearing from you during our first quarter earnings report. So thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you for joining us.",

            "name": "Cara Sylvester",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina, and hello, everyone. Today, I'm excited to talk about our guest experience. And you might ask Cara, how do we define guest experience at Target? Well, we think of it as the way we engage across America. From simply saying hello to consumers in a warm-Target way to deepening the relationships we have with existing Target guests, to how we create moments of discovery, connection and joy that invite people to choose Target again and again.\n But before we look back at the previous year and preview what's ahead, I want to ground us in a consumer point of view because to understand how Target designs its guest experience, we should start with how people are shopping today. As you heard from Christina gone are the days when people would follow a consistent and well-defined path from discovery to purchase. Today, shopping is nonlinear and simply a part of the general ecosystem of our lives.\n Instead of a stand-alone experience that feels planned or predictable, shopping has become immersive, always on and fully integrated into how we all go about our days. A large portion of U.S. consumers, about 40%, start their purchase online and 20% start on social platforms. And those are just the people who are actively looking to shop. Many more are enticed to shop by the inspiration they find scrolling their social feeds for hours every day. This is expansive retail, nontraditional entry points, seamless transition between stores, online and social and fully in tune with what shoppers want and need. To meet these shoppers where they are, we spend a lot of time getting to know what matters to them and seeing the Target experience through their eyes.\n Our guest base is broad and diverse. In fact, 96% of U.S. adults have shopped Target at some point in their life. Yet we know that your shopping experience in mind are going to look and feel very different based on a variety of factors. Our families, our interest, our budgets, our schedule and simply what brings us joy. Expectations also differ by category. If you're on a grocery run, you're looking for reliability and value. And if I'm shopping for one of my daughter's birthdays, I'm looking for inspiration and fun. These nuances are especially important for Target given our diverse multi-category portfolio. Yet even though your shop -- even though shopping journeys vary, after gathering feedback from millions of guests about what they care about and how Target fits into their lives, there are a few important truths that unite our guests and shape how we design our experience.\n First, Target guests love to shop. They consistently list shopping as one of their favorite activities, more so than your average consumer. 90% of guests tell us they're looking for quality products. They also want a meaningful connection with the brand, and they're ahead of the curve when it comes to keeping up with trends. Second, our guests are whenever-wherever-however shoppers, using multiple channels to create the experience that fits into their lives. They're in the driver's seat when it comes to creating the experience that works best for them. And we have to meet them where, when and how they need us.\n Finally, one more important factor that defines Target guests. They are loyal, really loyal. Our most engaged guest account for a greater share of sales than we see at other competitors. Showing that the connection we have with guests is sticky and drives growth and profitability. Quite simply, guests look to target for inspiration, to find on-trend, high-quality items at a great price and to have some fun. Are we affordable? Yes. Are we fast and convenient? Absolutely. Can you check off everything on your list no matter how you prefer to shop? You bet.\n But there are other retailers who can say the same. What makes Target different, what makes guests consistently choose us over any other retailer is how we make them feel when they interact with us. How we design our experience to elevate ordinary moments into extraordinary ones with a carefully curated assortment, bursts of discovery and delight and plenty of human connection along the way. \n There, of course, are the big splashes of the Target brand that grab headlines, generate buzz and make people smile. Like our Halloween Ghoul Lewis, who took the season by storm or the ugly squirrel sweater that we created in 48 hours to pay homage to the version worn by Taylor and Travis over the holidays or turning the Las Vegas Sphere into a huge holiday snow globe complete with Bullseye in resonance. But there are also millions of smaller everyday moments that strengthen the bonds we have with our guests making their lives a little bit easier and a little bit brighter.\n So when visiting one of our stores in San Antonio, Texas last year, I kept hearing about a team member who I needed to meet. In fact, even some guests stopped me and said, \"I absolutely needed to meet her.\" And they were right. She was somebody I absolutely needed to meet, and I wanted you to meet her too. Let me introduce you to Amelia.\n [Presentation] So I love that video because it captures who we are as a brand and what we aim to deliver across our entire guest experience. Our team brings so much empathy to their work. And it's not just the face-to-face interactions at checkout or in the aisles. Empathy is infused into how we design every part of the guest experience.\n Drive Up is a perfect example. The reason guests love Drive Up at Target because it's a -- service reflects what's most important to them. It's easy. Swing by, we'll bring out your order to you or even pick up your return. It's fast. Just tell us you're on your way. We'll be ready when you are, no pickup windows to worry about because we work on your schedule. It's fun at a Starbucks to make your trip that much more relaxing and it's all free. This is what we mean by designing an experience for our guests. Looking at a service through their eyes, using Target technology to rapidly iterate and introduce new capabilities and finding ways to not only meet their needs but add something extra to make their day. That's the Target experience.\n You saw that from us in 2023 as we continued on our path to be America's favorite discovery destination. Our stores are known as a getaway spot. Somewhere you can go and enjoy a few minutes or a few hours, browsing the aisles with friendly team members to help you find just what you need. We're bringing that same sense of exploration and relaxation to guests who walk through our digital front door. Last year, shoppers visited us more than 6 billion times on our digital channels, looking for the same warmth, newness and discovery that greets them when they walk into one of our front doors. In fact, more than half of guests who make a purchase in our stores have visited our app or our site that very same day, reinforcing how shoppers move fluidly from physical to online and back again.\n And Target is uniquely suited to be there for our guests when inspiration strikes because of our agile technology and the pathways we create between stores, digital, social, marketing and more. The experience we created this past holiday season is a great example. This year, there was clear connectivity across our experience to create a memorable and meaningful visit no matter how you choose to shop with us. Holiday gateways, in-store and online, digital gifting stations, product packaging to make you smile, in-store playlist to set the mood, festive TikTok content and Target Wonderland community pop-up events. These all work together to celebrate the holidays with our guests in a way that only Target can.\n Our ongoing investment in our digital capabilities enabled this year's fully connected holiday celebration. In 2023, we transformed our digital experience from a utilitarian shopping platform that was one-size-fits-all to one that is filled with warmth, greets you personally just like Amelia would and delivers a custom blend of newness, trend, value and ease just for you. And it's not just what the guests see but what's happening behind the scenes to power these personalized experiences. We're using generative AI to power our product detail pages to provide more friendly and relevant explanations of what guests want to know about our assortment.\n AI also powers features like shop the look and our get it now assistant, which lets you know when items in your cart are available for pickup at a nearby store. It's also the engine behind the insights we use to give guests more personal experiences and rewards through our loyalty program, Target Circle. And it's a key element of how we create thoughtfully curated campaigns for consumers through our advertising business, Roundel.\n This might be a good time to talk about how Roundel seamlessly integrates into the guest experience and continues to drive more than $1.5 billion in value for our business. Growing more than 20% in 2023, Roundel is the powerful bridge between our guests and the brands they love. Roundel works with more than 2,600 vendors to deliver creative that is resonant and wholly consistent with the Target experience. In return, our guests receive content that speaks directly to their interest and preferences. Take our holiday campaign with Apple.\n Tech products top many guests holiday gift list. So we worked with Apple on a comprehensive campaign to keep their products front and center for our guests this holiday season. With custom content designed to reach our guests across a number of platforms, including Connected TV, YouTube and social media. Our co-created holiday video ad made us the first Apple partner to highlight the new double tap feature on its Watch Series 9 in a spot. To add relevance, we used AI on our site to position the right products in the right moments. Think serving up promotions to RedCard holders, so they get the best deal plus extra 5% off by using their card or helping a guest find a perfect gift for their teenager, hint, go for the AirPods Pro.\n This integrated campaign tapped into our powerful ecosystem of digital, social, marketing and merchandising and absolutely resonated with shoppers. We deepened relationships with existing fans and attracted new ones with a significantly higher new guest rate compared to prior Apple campaigns at Target. In addition to the way Roundel powers the guest experience when guests are browsing our app or website unique to Target is our media mix with 35% of revenue being generated outside of our owned properties. That means that we're able to connect with consumers wherever they are, like on social or streaming platforms, driving more than 250 million visits to Target properties in 2023. \n And social is increasingly where our guests are. We have more followers than any other mass retailer on TikTok with incredibly high engagement, which underscores our opportunity to connect the love that guests have for us on social to a smooth path to purchase in stores and on our digital properties. Our guests use social to stay in touch with the latest trends in a way that feels specifically designed for them. So we're working across the spectrum of social, from user-generated content and Target creators to our talent partners and Target owned platforms to make it easier for guests to maintain that discovery mindset as they shop. \n Over the coming year, you'll see us experimenting to bring off-platform content on to our digital properties, so guests can find inspiration right on their sight in our app. And we'll blend social and commerce to create an experience that taps into real-time trends and makes off-line inspiration to online purchase intuitive and easy. So imagine a guest looking for just the right things for a housewarming celebration. They open our app, which is personalized just for them and type in housewarming party ideas. Using generative AI search, they see the latest products that fit their style and preferences, including delicious snacks from Good & Gather, cheap party supplies, modern glassware and even some new party outfits.\n We brought the fun of wandering the aisles of our stores alongside inspiration from lifestyle influencers to spark new finds, like beautiful living room decor. Our guest uses 3D visualization to see it in their space and AI-powered reviews to learn more. They love it and snap it up along with their must-have party supplies. Within a few hours, their haul arrives thanks to same-day delivery, they love the items so much. They share their finds on social media, inspiring other guests to shop Target.\n This is the future our teams are working on today, a seamless fluid shopping experience across stores, digital and social, and centered on what our guests want and need. And knowing what our guests want and need, deepening our connection with them and making millions of guests feel that every visit is made just for them is at the heart of our loyalty program Target Circle. We introduced the program in 2019 as a way to say thank you to guests with deals, rewards and perks. Today, we have more than 100 million members who have earned $2 billion in rewards. Members have told us how much they value the program, and it shows.\n Last year, they visited us 5x more often and spent 5x more than guests who aren't members of Target Circle, yet. And our personalized deals and bonus offers powered by our proprietary technology drove $1.5 billion in incremental sales last year. Yet members have also told us that it could be even easier to save and know how much they're saving. So we took this opportunity not just to improve our program but to reimagine how we think about loyalty across the entirety of our experience. So today, I am thrilled to introduce a new Target Circle, one that brings the best of Target together under one loyalty program. Here's a short video that we created to sum up with new and what's next.\n [Presentation] So bringing together Target Circle, Target Circle Card and Target Circle 360 simplifies and expands how we deliver value to our guests. And as we've been talking about, we've designed the program to give guests flexibility and control in how they shop. There's the Target Circle our guests know and love today that gives every member access to the best deals and rewards at Target. There's absolutely no cost to join. What's new is they can now shop target without having to search for and add offers. Deals are automatically applied at checkout, plus they'll continue to receive partner perks with Ulta Beauty and Apple and even more rewards through personalized bonuses based on their shopping behavior. For those guests who want to save even more, Target Circle Card offers an extra 5% off each trip. This is on top of the automatic savings they receive as Target Circle members, plus free 2-day shipping, extended time for returns and no annual fee.\n And with credit card, debit card or reloadable card options, consumers can find the product that's right for them. And finally, for those who want the magic of Target delivered to their door in as little as 1 hour, there's Target Circle 360, an extension of the same-day capabilities we've built since our acquisition of Shipt in 2017. Target Circle 360 members can order everything from groceries, to household essentials, to the newest must-have item with no additional fees, no markups and support from a preferred shopper. Members even have access to Shipt's multi-retailer marketplace, which gives them access to even more items from their favorite local stores. No waiting for days for boxes to arrive on your doorstep, just unlimited same-day delivery that we're rolling out to guests at the promotional price of $49, which will be the standard price for Target Circle cardholders. \n Guests will have access to the new Target Circle starting April 7 and we can't wait for them to feel the difference. This is just the beginning for Target Circle. Our AI-powered models will continue to deepen our relationship with guests and enable us to deliver one-on-one personalization at scale. And with this new foundation in place, we'll continue adding benefits and perks based on what matters most to our guests, like exclusive partnerships, product offers and more so they can get the most out of shopping at Target. This goes back full circle, pun intended to how people are shopping today. Shopping is dynamic and so are we. The investments we're making reflect our focus on consumers' preferences and needs, so we continue to be their first choice for discovery, delight and experiences that make them smile. \n That's Target's guest experience at its best, building connection and celebrating everyday moments in meaningful and memorable ways. Moving with our guests through their lives. So we're able to bring joy whenever we can. That's the Target magic, and it's what fuels our future. Now I'd like to welcome a familiar face with an expanded title to the stage, Michael Fiddelke. Take it away. We're really excited to talk about it. And I think it's really important that we really anchor on the entire Target Circle ecosystem. That was really important to us. And the notion of accessibility and for all is really, really important. That's why we first are reimagining how we're thinking about delivering value. Our guests are really clear. They want value, affordability and they want ease and so we're making it even easier for our 100 million members to actually be able to get the deals and rewards that they want with automatic savings applied at checkout. I'll hit on your question around pricing in just a minute, but I think it's really important to talk about our cardholders as well. Today, the cardholders, that program doesn't work with Target Circle. And so what we're doing is we're actually bringing these 2 things together. \n So that not only do you get 5% off every trip, and extended returns and free shipping, you also get all the benefits of the base Target Circle program, which are those deals that our guests love and those personalized rewards that are based specifically on your shopping behavior. The other thing that we're adding for our cardholders is an evergreen price of $49 for Target Circle 360. So if you are a cardholder for us, always on price will be $49, which is an amazing price, and it's less than $1 a week of the magic of Target delivered to your door. \n For Target Circle 360, we're really excited to build on our strength in same-day delivery since our acquisition of Shipt in 2017, you will get the magic of Target delivered to your door in less than an hour. You'll also have access to the Shipt marketplace of benefits. You will also have access to all of those deals and rewards and personalized perks as part of the base Circle program. It's just the beginning for us, that $49 is an introductory promotional price for Target Circle 360. Absolutely. We see -- we talk a lot about digital influence sales. We know how consumers are shopping today. And so many of us, right, are starting, even if you love shopping and only purchase in stores, you're using our app to check out what's new, to see if something is in stock, et cetera. So we understand the power of digitally influenced store sales. What we also see, though, is the power of store influenced digital sales because we know some guests are browsing in stores and actually are pulling up their app right while they're in the store and having impact digitally. \n We certainly also see as we enter new markets, the power of our same-day services. That has been a shining star for us across the entire digital portfolio. I talked in my remarks about why that is in terms of the relationship that we have. And once guests try our same-day services, they love it. It is sticky in their lives. We are literally making their lives better. So we'll continue to build on that. But that's another great example. There's a lot there. Absolutely. And so as I think about the introduction of Target Circle 360, we are absolutely looking at a wide range of what partnerships could look like to add benefits. Importantly, though, we are always going to be listening to our guests. That is how we actually struck up our conversation and partnership with Ulta Beauty as well as what we offer in our base program today with Apple. And so we'll be guests led, not Target led as we think about the types of partnerships that will add value to our guest lives. I do want to hit on specifically your question around Shipt. We do not leverage any data of Shipt on their marketplace internally at Target as we think about our assortment."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on what you've heard so far this morning, I want to emphasize 2 key themes. First, we build the foundation for long-term growth with a strategy that is both unique to Target and durable. And second, we're committed to building on that foundation for years to come. So this morning, I'll walk through the ways we're leaning into our core strengths, capabilities and differentiators we've built and refined over time to meet consumers where they are and drive long-term market share gains, sales growth and profitability.\n I want to start with an outlook on the consumer, which remains mixed. While there are some encouraging signs in the economy, there are also stubborn pressures impacting families and retails. Consumers say they still feel stretched, they're balancing a lot and having to make trade-offs to meet their needs of their families while sprinkling in the occasional luxury.\n And yet their affinity for style and newness plus early signs of disinflation contributed to a sequential uptick in discretionary category performance over the last 2 quarters, something we aim to build on and accelerate. At the same time, we expect consumers will remain highly value conscious, hunting for great promotions and seeking comprehensive value in their purchases. Consumers are also creating stability with small doses of everyday joy. After the volatility of the global pandemic, they're now coping with geopolitical tensions, social and political divisiveness and uncertainty around personal finances. This all demonstrates that our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life remains incredibly relevant. And the assets and capabilities we've [ culted ] over time, like new and remodeled stores, investments in digital shopping, supply chain and loyalty, they've all increased consumers' view of us as an omnichannel powerhouse.\n Those enhanced strengths were built on long-established differentiators like design, curation, a well-balanced multi-category assortment and outstanding value. And those are just some of the elements we'll build upon and amplify through our strategy as we move through 2024 and beyond. \n Think about the opportunities around something like omnichannel discovery, designing experiences that support discovery has always been one of our strengths. Our stores are famous or perhaps infamous for inspiring guests to discover more than they expected. Millions of guests have experienced the joy of entering a Target store for a few items and end up leaving with extra treasures they didn't anticipate. This is a key aspect of how we set ourselves apart from our competitors and something we'll continue to build on, regardless of where or how the shopping trip begins. After all, shopping looks very different now than it did a few years ago. It's no longer a point-in-time transactional event. Consumers today are constantly taking in new information and seeking inspiration from influencers and trendsetters.\n Target is already a trend shaper, but there's an opportunity to accelerate this further on both the platforms we own and on external platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Cara will share more specifics later. So I'll just say that our team's energy and engagement in building these discovery-driven experiences are truly inspiring. It's indicative of an ambition to meet consumers where they are. So that wherever and however a shopping journey starts, the path leads back to Target as a destination.\n We have long been known for delighting guests through a carefully curated set of products and partnerships. We believe that a well-curated assortment isn't just good for managing inventory. It can be additive to the shopping experience, too. Here's an extreme example. Imagine a restaurant with a seemingly infinite menu with countless of -- pages of every type of cuisine and no cohesive point of view. Endless choice creates decision fatigue, taking away from an otherwise joyful outing. Sometimes less is truly more. We make choices that allow us to offer a menu of products, designing to serve a wide variety of guest needs, helping to guide their shopping journey while ensuring a joyful and productive trip. Now to be clear, this does take balance. We don't offer an endless aisle, but we do offer a compelling range of choices and price points throughout our assortment.\n We think of our assortment like a 3-legged stool. It works best when we develop owned brands that offer unmatched value and quality, provide the best industry-leading national brands and cultivate partnerships that enhance our assortment. So let's start with our owned brands. We've invested heavily over the past several years to continue to innovate and differentiate through our owned brands, and we're not slowing down. Across the portfolio, we're launching new brands and expanding upon those already loved by our guests. In fact, owned brands are so core to who we are, following my remarks, I've asked Jill Sando and Rick Gomez to join me and highlight how our unique skills and assets allow us to sustain and grow this massive owned brand portfolio. And it's because of these differentiated end-to-end capabilities that we're able to rapidly scale affordable owned brands without compromising quality.\n These capabilities also make us an attractive partner to some of the greatest designers around. Recently, we announced an upcoming partnership with iconic fashion designer, Diane von Furstenberg. This collection will feature the signature patterns and colors that DVF is known for, along with her iconic wrap dresses. With a multigenerational appeal and offerings in extended sizes as well as options for kids, this collection features more than 200 items spanning apparel, accessories, beauty and home, combining timeless fashion with only at Target prices and value.\n Our second priority is to extend our assortment with the best national brand consumers want from Target. Stanley Drinkware is a timely example. Well before it became a cultural moment, we were early to recognize this brand's potential allowing us to get a big jump on this trend. We secured great allocations across the portfolio and partnered with Stanley to create exclusive colors for our guests, both in the core line and through our only at Target brand Hearth & Hand with Magnolia.\n Similarly, celebrity-founded Beauty brands are taking over social media, and our guests say they want to find them at Target. That's why we partnered with Ashley Tisdale, on our exclusive to Target launch of Being Frenshe, a line of personal care products powered by mood boosting scents and self-care rituals. It's also why we've recently added Lemme, Kourtney Kardashian Barker's new line of vitamin and botanical supplements to our assortment. These trending brands add to the credibility we built in the Beauty space and will continue to support our leadership role in these categories.\n Our third priority is to round out our assortment with a focus on partnerships, which provide deeper expertise and brand recognition for our guests. We've had tremendous success attracting and cultivating these unique collaborations and, in the years ahead we expect they'll play an even bigger role given the incrementality they've delivered. We continue to expand the presence of Ulta Beauty at Target, Levi's, Apple, Disney and more bringing industry-leading offerings and continued differentiation for Target. And last year, we launched a new partnership with Kendra Scott, and our guests couldn't get enough. These colorful jewelry and accessory pieces not only look good, but they do good too. With a shared vision for philanthropy, this collaboration shines bright on multiple levels. Expect plenty of new offerings in this partnership in 2024 and for years to come.\n Surrounding all our assortment choices is an unwavering focus on value, which starts with price but encompasses so much more. We continue to offer fantastic everyday low prices, and we're focused on clearly and effectively communicating our value proposition. One way we've done this is by simplifying our end caps to feature single price points and promotions. This allows us to clarify the incredible value we offer while helping our guests to effortlessly recognize the value. No games, no confusion.\n Additionally, our efficiency efforts and the greater size and scale we've achieved in the recent years have allowed us to further sharpen price points across our assortment. We continuously find ways to add quality and newness to our own brand portfolio without increasing prices. And of course, our focus on retail fundamentals serves as a through line supporting guests on their shopping journey before, during and after they make a purchase. These efforts are always on focus, and we continue to deliver a unique blend of physical and digital shopping, will further leverage our fleet of nearly 2,000 stores to serve as inspiring shopping destinations and as fulfillment hubs for digital orders. And in the same way we focus on our store and digital assets, we continually invest in our team.\n We take care of our team so they can take care of our guests. From providing world-class service to ensuring we're in stock, we want our guests to feel confident that they will be cared for and find what they seek on every Target run. In fact, it was a dedication of our team that allowed us to maintain leaner, healthier inventory levels last year, which positions us well as we enter a new year. This led to stronger profit outcomes, improved in-stocks and perhaps, most importantly, increased flexibility, allowing us to react quickly to changing trends.\n We're also using technology to reduce costs, increase delivery speed and improve consistency in our operations. Years ago, we took a bold stance when we outlined our plans to invest in stores at a time when the role of brick-and-mortar was in question. Investing to automate upstream replenishment and optimize last-mile delivery, we develop new ways to increase our delivery speed and reduce operating costs. These technology investments, which increased through the throughput of our existing store locations helped to quiet the store-versus-digital debate. As we pioneered the stores-as-hub strategy in support of the omnichannel services we provide.\n We're excited about the impact of continued advancements in technology like generative AI and the additive ways these tools will empower our teams. But we also want to make sure that human connection remains at the center of the Target experience. This is why we'll continue to invest in technology while never losing sight of what makes life rich. The relationships and interactions we have with one another. Just as we uniquely saw the importance of combining physical stores and digital capabilities, we want to make sure we lean into emerging technologies and focus on placing them in the hands of our incredible Target team.\n And finally, we'll continue to invest in technology to support segmentation and personalization. We love it when guests walk into one of our nearly 2,000 locations and says, \"This is my Target.\" In the same way, we want to design an experience in which a guest places an item in their cart and says, \"This was made just for me.\" This balance of scale and personalization is unique in retail, something we do well and can continue to build on. After all, we have an enviable consumer base that is highly engaged with our brand and they shop us frequently across our multi-category assortment, allowing us to gain invaluable insights across nearly all retail segments, not just 1 or 2. \n It's also why our Roundel advertising business is so powerful. We're constantly listening and learning from our guest base, allowing us to offer rich insights to our vendors, offer compelling and personalized advertisements to our guests and grow this aspect of the business in meaningful and lasting ways. You'll hear more from Cara on enhancements to our loyalty ecosystem, Roundel's growing reach and our digital experience aimed at enhancing digital discovery.\n It's one thing to hear about these strategic initiatives, and it's another thing to see them in action. I'm often on the road to witness firsthand how our guests are experiencing joy through our assortment, shopping experience and our teams' dedication in serving them every day. On a recent trip to Orlando, I visited one of our smaller stores near Disney World. Our segmentation and assortment planning work, let us focus on serving 2 very distinct segments in this market. One segment consists of the many Disney cast members who utilize this Target store to meet their everyday wants and needs on their way to and from work. The other segment is comprised of families who are visiting the area looking to get everything they need to support their family vacations. These guest segments have very different Target run missions, and yet we're able to provide a cohesive experience that satisfies both of them.\n Similarly, a few weeks back, I traveled to Texas with members of my Beauty and Apparel teams. We heard directly from guests about the love of finding all their styling needs under one roof. From cosmetics and skin care items in Ulta Beauty, to apparel assortments only available at Target to bold jewelry pieces from Kendra Scott. These powerhouse brands have all come together to offer consumers at this store, a sum that is greater than the individual parts.\n On another trip, I visited a store in Mississippi, where we had recently completed a wall-to-wall remodel. We elevated the shopping experience, refreshed the assortment and even added a Starbucks, the first one ever in this area. Our local team is incredibly proud that their Target store has become the social hub of this tight-knit community. These examples illustrate the interplay of our strategies, assortment, experience and capabilities. Showing how we're positioning Target to play a unique role in American retail.\n So now before I turn things over to Cara, I'm going to invite Jill and Rick to the stage for a discussion on the power of Target's owned brand capabilities, and how they help Target stand out in a crowded marketplace. Okay. Well, thanks for joining me. Why don't we start Jill and Rick by telling us a little bit about yourselves and your careers. We're happy to have you here. Okay. Our owned brand portfolio on its own would be a Fortune 100 company. More than $30 billion in sales and nearly 1/3 of our total revenue and even more of our gross margin. That's because we have amazing capabilities that allow us to produce brands our guests genuinely love. Jill, let's start with one I know you're particularly excited about a new brand in toys called Gigglescape. I love them. They're super cute. Okay. Rick, our frequency categories play such a crucial role in driving trips. And with up & up and dealworthy, we're giving our guests new reasons to choose Target. Can you tell us about that? Indeed, our frequency businesses are an important part of driving trips to Target, meeting guest critical needs but our discretionaries have the -- categories have the opportunity to do that as well. Jill, can you tell us a little bit about Cat & Jack? Thank you, Jill. Rick, let's switch gears a little bit and talk about Good & Gather because that's a brand that's helped us reimagine our grocery space and experience and really build our credibility in food. Well, it's abundantly clear that our guests rely on our owned brands. Jill, you've been a part of these launches for so many years in your career. What makes us a leader in this space? Well, our capabilities certainly are first rate. But that human touch, fueled by the power of insights, can't be stressed enough. Well, Jill, this leads the enhanced approach we take into brand management, including a team under your leadership. Well, thank you both. I love that, and that's a perfect note to close on, consumer centricity. That's a theme running through everything we've covered today, new brands like Gigglescape, Figmint and dealworthy. Our relaunched up & up and powerhouses like Gather and Cat & Jack. So thank you, Rick and Jill for that look into our owned brand work, it really is incredible.\n When I think about Target's right to win in this environment and our ability to meet key consumer needs, our owned brand is foundational to so many of our plans. That's because the investments we made in our capabilities and our team over more than 2 decades, combined to form competitive advantage that few retailers anywhere can match. And it's not just a competitive moat we're talking about here because we're not hunkering down, playing defense. This work is our springboard into the future.\n And through the incredible value we -- value our owned brands offer across each of our key categories, and the compelling newness they're adding to our entire assortment, we'll continue to deepen our relationships with our guests and will give all consumers compelling reasons to choose Target.\n Now I'll hand it off to Cara Sylvester, who will tell us more about how we're getting these products in front of consumers and engaging with our guests and potential guests more broadly. Thank you. Cara? Yes. Thank you for the question. We have evolved significantly over the last 1.5 years plus. What we've been living through over the last couple of years really has been quite unprecedented. And the opportunity has been to infuse more agility and flexibility into our model. So in 2023, we bought with an intention of [ placing bets ] on the things that we were most excited about, innovation, newness, our own brands, where we saw the business trends were. But we also wanted to make sure that we created flexibility in the model. And so overall, we certainly bought less in those down-trending categories to manage the inventory. But by buying less led to swifter operations, ease and just clarity in how to operate within this environment. We were also able to introduce levers through dual sourcing capabilities, a country of production diversification having more domestic backup.\n So in categories like apparel, where it's really important that we're on trend and we're able to get things that we need quickly based on what we're seeing in the market. We have increased our flexibility levers manyfold and are using reserve open to buy basically receipts that we haven't spend as well as other flexibility levers to buy into the things that are working. And it is really paying off. Not only did we manage our inventory levels significantly lower and led to significantly increase in stocks, the best we've had in 4 years as well as being able to chase into the things that matter. Our apparel business is perhaps the best example of that, where we've seen green shoots of acceleration quarter-by-quarter. And not totally visible when you look at the aggregate comp, our discretionary comps were the best in the fourth quarter. They were better than in the first quarter. So we've seen that discretionary comp acceleration through the year. That's what we plan to build on in 2024. Yes. The only thing I'd add, even the lifelong relationship with college students, you heard Jill be very intentional. We actually seek to make sure that we are really relevant at certain life stages, especially early on in our consumers' lives. Think about the strength that we have in a business like baby, then we migrate them to toys, then we migrate them into video games and/or into juniors. And then having then presence, we do very well at back-to-school and back-to-college time frames. It's very intentional in making sure that our brand stays in touch with families through every life stage. College is the natural next step in that phase and then, of course, back to childbirth. So afterwards. And so that's been very intentional, but then to build back on segmentation opportunities yes, we've learned a lot. I mean, these boxes are small. They're difficult to operate. \n We certainly have to cut the SKU count intensively, and we have to study the macro -- or the micro environment of competitors. And so this ability to formulate the right assortment strategy for that community has taught us a lot about the potential to expand that further into our larger size boxes. And we see tons of upside and potential in more sophisticated segmentation and allocation strategies that allow us to optimize the local potential. More specifically on how we build assortment and premium prices to answer some of your questions. Our goal is to make sure that we are meeting our guests' needs across a wide range of shopping occasions. And so we look at -- you heard us describe this especially when we talk about [ own brands ], right? We look for unmet need spaces and white spaces to innovate against. \n Over the last year, we've spent a lot of time making sure that we have our value equation shored up. And the introduction of dealworthy is a big deal for us. It is an opening price point brand across the entirety of the portfolio outside of food and beverage, where we already have Market Pantry. So just make sure we really have value options for all consumers so that they can meet their budgets. On the flip side, we do really well with Ulta Beauty, which is premium beauty. \n And it's based on the insight that we've known for years in beauty, almost all beauty shoppers shop both. They shop mass and they start to shop premium. And for us to be able to service the guests and service all the trips in that category, we needed a solution [ for growth ], which allowed us to build this partnership with Ulta, which we're really, really happy about. And we do that across the -- we do that across the portfolio to say where is the opportunity for Target to serve a unique need and where are the unmet needs in the category. And our guest has given us a lot of freedom to say, I'll spend $600 on this item. And by the way, I don't want to spend more than $2 on my body wash. And that's fine, whatever works for them."

            "name": "Jill Sando",
            "content": "Good morning. I am Jill Sando and I lead the Apparel & Accessories, Home and Hardlines merchandising organization. I've been with Target for over 25 years. The majority of that time has been in merchandising, running different businesses across our discretionary portfolio. Also spent some time in planning and help stand up our product design and development capabilities for our non-apparel businesses. Kids related categories are huge for Target and toys plays a key role in keeping Target relevant with families. National brands like LEGO and exclusive brands like Our Generation have made Target one of the biggest toy retailers in America. And the addition of Gigglescape gives consumers on more only-at-Target reason to shop toys. Gigglescape is important for a few reasons. It's consumer-centric. It's our first owned brand design specifically for generation alpha and their unique needs. It's filling white space in our owned brand assortment and it has us poised to drive growth in a high-margin category.\n And Gigglescape is priced to be accessible to all families. Just a few weeks ago, we launched our stuffed animals. Most are priced under $10 and soon we'll launch books, puzzles and toys with all items in our spring assortment priced under $20. That kind of pricing makes it perfect for gifts and for the spur-of-the-moment purchases because your child is being good today. This is a brand that makes our toys destination -- our toys department a destination even when your Target run was inspired by something else and makes Target an even stronger destination for toys. Yes. Kids apparel is another area where we have outsized market share and Cat & Jack is a big part of that. This is the kids brand that we launched in 2016. Today, it's a $3 billion brand, the biggest kids brand in America. To put that into perspective, consider this, we sell well over 300 million units of Cat & Jack a year, which comes out to about 8 Cat & Jack items for every child in America under the age of 12. This is part of a discretionary category, but Cat & Jack is a brand that drives repeat business for Target because of great prices and great quality, which parents love and great design that kids love.\n And when you think about kids style, the success of Cat & Jack pays dividends across our portfolio. It drives trips and sales across the store during key moments like back-to-school and throughout the year as kids grow into new sizes. Cat & Jack also complements brands like Wild Fable. That's our juniors brand, worn by millions of teens and tweens who started in Cat & Jack. It's one of the biggest juniors brands in the country and one we just extended into swim. Wild Fable is a great brand on its own, one fueled by our speed to trend in a very dynamic category, but it also has an important advantage since families are already in the habit of turning to Target for clothes for their kids. We have unrivaled design capabilities, amazing talent across our team, hundreds of patents, it is no exaggeration to say that Target pioneered cheap [indiscernible]. And what we're doing is so hard to replicate because we didn't decide to make a play in owned brands 5 or even 10 years ago. We've been doing this for decades. We've had an in-house sourcing capability for 25 years. Now today, it spans 20 offices across 14 countries. Because we own our end-to-end sourcing business, we control our own destiny. When you think about issues like country of production and raw material costs. We're more cost-effective with far fewer intermediaries in our network, which allows us to grow our bottom line even as we pass savings on to our guest.\n We can adapt quickly to emerging trends, which keeps us relevant and we're able to pursue bold sustainability goals, which is important to driving growth by delivering on something that matters so much to millions of consumers. And those sustainability goals will also help ensure both the resiliency of our business model through responsible stewardship of the resources that we rely on and our ability to deliver the quality that our guests rely on. That's right. When we designed All In Motion, our performance brand, the first thing that we did was to engage with 15,000 consumers. We talked to fitness coaches, we attended dozens of workout classes because if you're designing for the consumer, it starts with listening to the consumer. And we're not just consumer-led when we're launching a product, we're consumer-led in how we continue to grow and develop our owned brands because you can't mistake performance for potential.\n Cat & Jack has been a runaway success, but we also learned through listing that we had opportunities to make the brand more appealing to more guests. Among other things, that led to the adaptive items we created to help all kids look and feel their best and the expansions we made to our dressy and mid-dressy assortment, giving families more reasons to choose Cat & Jack and Target. We launched our brand management capability years ago and created an end-to-end process to successfully launch owned brands. And that has enabled an accelerated rollout of owned brands over the past 5 years. And we've been evolving our capabilities and are now operating more like a CPG company, the research, the market analysis, looking hard at the white space. That's shaped our decision making around existing brands, like prioritizing Threshold as our flagship home brand and then offering a range of styles within it. That's critical because Target is one of the biggest home retailers in the country, and this is making it easier for our consumers to navigate our assortment and our brand management work was critical to the success of our new kitchenware brand Figmint, which debuted last fall.\n This isn't the first time selling kitchenware as part of an owned brand, but it is our first owned brand devoted solely to Kitchenware and our guests love it. Baskets with Figmint items are 25% larger than our previous owned brand offering. And Figmint was one of several factors that helped us accelerate our Kitchenware business by more than 500 basis points between Q3 and Q4 taking us from a negative comp to a positive comp. Guests respond to newness and innovation and great design and Figmint is just one example of that."

            "name": "Richard Gomez",
            "content": "Hello. Good morning. I'm Rick Gomez, I lead Target's Food, Essentials and Beauty businesses. I've had the opportunity to lead a variety of different disciplines at Target, including marketing, digital strategy. And then before Target, I spent over 20 years working in the CPG industry developing, launching and managing a bunch of different Food & Beverage brands. Yes. Well, as you know, Christina, we invest a lot of time listening to consumers to better understand their needs. And one of the themes that we are consistently hearing is the need for value and affordability. So to address this consumer need, we are relaunching up & up and introducing dealworthy. up & up is one of Target's most popular brands, delivering nearly $3 billion in sales, offering over 2,000 everyday items at affordable prices. And now we are making it even bigger and even better. We have developed product improvements across 40% of the line. We are also introducing hundreds of new items, and we are offering great prices with the average item priced under $7.\n We're also launching dealworthy. It's our new low-priced brand with items across the store, ranging from socks, laundry detergent, phone chargers, and I can't stress enough what a great value dealworthy will be. The most items will be priced under $10. And some of those electronics items will be priced at 50% lower than what was previously offered at Target. dealworthy will be the lowest-priced item in each category offering absolutely incredible value. Yes. Absolutely. I'd love to talk about Food & Beverage. Our Food & Beverage business delivers over $20 billion in sales, and that's up $8 billion in sales since 2019. That's because over the last few years, we've been making big strides in improving the Food & Beverage experience. I'd like to say that we have gone from being a retailer that just sells food to a retailer that truly celebrates food. And in doing that, we have made Target a destination for food. Now, Good & Gather has played a key role in that at nearly $4 billion in sales. Good & Gather delivers a great value proposition, delicious products that the whole family will enjoy, high-quality ingredients with no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup. And importantly, great pricing with most items under $5.\n And we're not done growing the Good & Gather brand. Last fall, we expanded Good & Gather into new incremental spaces that are important to our guests like Good & Gather Baby and Toddler creating another go-to Target -- another go-to category for parents with young children at Target. And these capabilities, they really do set Target apart, especially considering the scale at which we operate, delivering a steady drumbeat of newness to consumers. In my previous role in the CPG industry, it was a big year if we launched a few dozen new products. But for our food scientists, that's a couple of weeks' worth of work. In Food & Beverage alone this year, we'll add hundreds of new items to Good & Gather and Favorite Day and that's on top of the hundreds of new items that we launched last year. We are delivering innovation at scale that is unmatched by others. Consumer insight has also helped to continue to develop and grow Favorite Day. We launched the brand during the pandemic, and we've seen it drive trips, build baskets, delivering double-digit growth year after year. So as Food & Beverage has become a go-to category for Target during the holidays, we've expanded the role of Favorite Day to offer key seasonal items. You saw that in November and December with gingerbread kits, hot cocoa-bombs, a huge range of snack mixes. And just a few weeks ago, Favorite Day was front and center for Valentine's Day. And we'll continue to expand Favorite Day into those big seasonal moments that are so important to our guests and important to keeping Target relevant. There's been a lot of work in Food & Beverage to sharpen the focus of our brand portfolio. The launch of a flagship brand, Good & Gather was the first step. We focused Market Pantry on family favorites at our most affordable prices and we've also retired our previous snack and dessert brand, Archer Farms and replaced with Favorite Day, a brand with a much stronger identity around indulgent treats for the whole family.\n All of this helps Target make consumer-centric decisions about our assortment, like the addition of 50 new F&B items for Easter and dozens more that we're launching just in time for the summer season, including a Favorite Day soda. Now it sounds simple, but the thoughtful, deliberate, holistic approach to designing, launching and managing our brands, it's the difference between rolling out catchall brands and the difference between that and building brands that consumers love because we're meeting their needs in a really meaningful way."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. We're looking forward to providing our perspective on the results we shared this morning, and I can't wait for you to hear from several of our top leaders, including Christina Hennington, Rick Gomez, Jill Sando, Cara Sylvester and Michael Fiddelke. While Michael still has his hands firmly on the wheel as CFO, this is his first FCM in his new role as our Chief Operating Officer. I can tell you, we're looking forward to discussing Target's growth horizon and how it transcends volatility over any particular quarter or year. Our preference is always to think long term.\n It's why for years now, we've emphasized the durability of our business model. And many of you have validated that orientation in the conversations we've had with you over the years. So our session today will focus squarely on the long-term thinking that has driven top and bottom line growth over the last decade and positions us for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. You might be asking, why focus on decades? In part because that feels like a long enough time frame to be meaningful. But it's also because we look at longer horizons when evaluating growth potential for investments like new stores, supply chain and other assets. \n And it's good to ask what else would need to be true for those investments to succeed? So we'll analyze our 2023 performance in that context. We'll provide insights on how our '24 plans and guidance fit into that vision. And we'll spend time outlining our plan for sustained growth as well as our capacity to react to unforeseen realities. Both have been important over the last 10 years.\n By designing for steady growth before 2020, we were positioned to absorb exponential growth during a demand boom that none of us could have anticipated. Even now the country and the retail industry, are in a prolonged, post-pandemic return to normal, which has been nearly as unpredictable as a pandemic itself from a consumer, social, political and economic perspective. By staying agile as a team and by continuously refining our approach and innovating, we've been able to navigate this time frame.\n In fact, if you think back to our earlier algorithms and long-range plans, we're well ahead of where we believe we'd be just a few short years ago. At the same time, we recognize this is a unique moment to clarify our road map for growth. Let me be really clear. Our goal is to recapture profitable sales, traffic and market share gains by expanding what makes Target different and better for our guests, amplifying our appeal to consumers beyond our existing guest base, and reinforcing the innovation and investment that drive durable and consistent results for our business and shareholders. So I might start today with the elements of the overall strategy that have been staples all along and will continue to be staples going forward.\n Starting with our stores. The most visible and tangible proof of our long-term planning and investment. When I arrived at Target, we had just over 1,800 stores that didn't quite cover all 50 states. Since then, we built more than 200 new stores. We've invested in more than 1,200 existing locations through remodels and partnerships, and our store footprint has expanded to cover the entire U.S. While retail is decades in the new digital era, on any given day, 2/3 or 3/4 of all U.S. shopping is still done in stores. And thanks to the stores-as-hub model, we invented in the last decade, nearly all Target shopping, including our significant digital penetration growth and our $30-plus billion in revenue growth was made possible by our stores.\n So if you think store shopping will wind down anytime in the next decade, we'll politely disagree on that point once again. Over the next decade, we expect to open more than 300 new mostly full-size stores and [ make ] billions of dollars in incremental growth, while continuing to remodel stores with plans to invest in the vast majority of our nearly 2,000 stores in the next 10 years. We'll also continue to invest in our supply chain and technology. In less than 10 years, we've created, acquired and constantly advanced sortation centers, upstreamed distribution centers, food distribution centers, and a steady stream of replenishment, technology and logistics innovation. At least 10 additional supply chain facilities are in the pipeline, and will be operating within the next decade.\n Underpinning all of this is our long-standing and ongoing investment in technology. This includes a leading team of engineers, data scientists and product managers focused on further integrating AI and machine learning and driving early adoption of generative AI, all geared towards making it easier for our team to best serve our guests across both the digital and physical assets. Take same-day fulfillment. Our initial investments gave us an early lead in same-day. Today, same-day is much more competitive but continued innovation and better integration with our Target ecosystem means we're ready to expand same-day delivery for our guests while also building on our next-day capabilities. You'll hear more about this from Christina and Cara including big moves we're making with Target Circle, a program that didn't exist 10 years ago, but today has well over 100 million members.\n Cara will talk about the incredible progress the team has made with Target Circle and where we're headed next. For now, I'll just emphasize the focus we're placing on unlimited same-day delivery through a new membership feature called Target Circle 360, which is launching next month. Here's the takeaway. Without huge investments in stores, supply chain and tech, there is no drive-up or order pickup, which were monumental growth drivers during COVID and today. And without stores, supply chain and tech and providers like UPS, FedEx and Shipt, there is no home delivery which is ready for a step change in guest acquisition, satisfaction and loyalty. As we move forward, we'll leverage our 2017 acquisition of Shipt to help us build unmistakable recognition for Target same-day delivery.\n Target's Roundel advertising business is another example of something that didn't exist 10 years ago. But today, it's the fastest-growing contributor to the other revenue line on our P&L. In a crowded field of similar offerings, we're punching way above our weight relative to the scale of our retail footprint. The unique relationship we have with our guests and the value our ad business unlocks for the brands that advertise with us are at the heart of Roundel's performance to date. And since our road map for growth focuses on strengthening our relationship with guests, and converting more consumers into guests, we see tremendous growth potential for Roundel for years to come.\n There are a number of other points of continuity and cohesion in our strategy. But for this intro, I'll focus on just one more. That's the strength of our multi-category portfolio and the balance and stability offered by our mix of frequency and discretionary categories. The way we bring those categories to consumers is a stand-out strength we'll continue to build on. The curation, the authority and trend in newness and the competitive advantage and assortment built around beloved national brands, world-class brand partnerships and a fleet of owned brands that drives about 1/3 of our business and puts us in a league of our own.\n Ten years ago, our Starbucks and Disney collaborations were strong and growing, and we're building our partnership with Apple. Those 3 relationships continue to grow throughout this time frame, and we added and expanded outstanding partnerships with CVS, Levi's, Hearth & Hand with Magnolia and Ulta Beauty at Target that drive traffic, sales and loyalty. This element of our strategy has been a bright part of our future. It will continue to play a big role in the decade ahead. And our team's expertise and product design and development and brand creation and management, they're towering strengths that really fuel our own brand portfolio.\n Brands like Cat & Jack, Threshold, Good & Gather, they bring millions of guests to Target. There are 3 of the 11 brands that generate $1 billion or more in sales each year, a lineup that looked much more modest a decade ago. And they lead a roster of Target brands that contribute to more than $30 billion in annual sales, plus outstanding margins for our bottom line.  A steady cadence of brand launches like Figmint last year, and dealworthy last month, help keep our edges sharp on the newness, discovery and affordability consumers crave in the market and find at Target. I believe our own brand capabilities will only become more prominent in the decade ahead, which is why we'll spend time this morning taking you behind the scenes on where we're headed with our owned brands. \n Another area where we'll continue to excel is our commitment to our team. In the last decade, we've taken a leadership position in both pay and benefits and learning and development and we'll continue to be a pacesetter as we ensure our team has all the support they need to take care of our guests, themselves and their families. So as we start to pull all this together, you might be saying, Brian, clearly, Target has some strong assets and advantages and cultivated a great team. But what does that mean for 2024 or 2034? I can tell you, our team has been humble enough as that and many other related questions. We're not taking anything for granted. There's no complacency about our past success. And while we recognize that a rebound in discretionary spending will favor our brand and our business. We're not waiting for economic changes or a different consumer outlook.\n I've been on the road nonstop since November, walking our stores, distribution floors. And I can tell you, the energy and initiative of our front-line team. What they're bringing to our business this year simply can't be conveyed on the slides behind me. This team has shifted to their front foot, and they're changing the momentum of our business, which is why we've seen sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 to Q4. Discretionary declines moderated. Traffic trends rebounded. Our Q4 comps were the high end of our guidance. We drove major gains in efficiency and outperformed our guidance of $1 billion in full year profit growth. Recognizing that we needed to clear the volatility and the challenges in the last 2 years, our team buckled down and said, \"Go time.\"\n But in recent weeks, I've seen the spelling expand by 2 letters. And I've seen the ambition, expand even more than that. What our team is talking about now is grow time. That's the mantra I hear bubbling up from the front line, all with the commitment to recapturing top line growth, traffic and share gains in the years immediately ahead. That starts with ensuring our team can deliver for our guests each and every day. A major step is coming soon with the upgrades we're launching in Target Circle. Upgrades that will make it even easier to unlock the best of Target. At the same time, a focused list of priorities, along with a continued concentration on retail fundamentals, like affordability and in-stock reliability, will make our guest experience easy and dependable in every interaction. We'll continue to focus on delighting our guests with the products, partnerships and value that make Target feel both elevated and accessible.\n The hallmarks here are expert curation, style and trend authority, newness, great design and incredible value. We'll also accelerate our progress in omnichannel discovery. We've all seen how shopping is changing into an always-on activity that's integrated across several aspects of our lives, well beyond physical and digital stores. Discovery and inspiration has always been a hallmark of our shopping experience. We started by providing inspiration and easy access at our stores with no barriers between impulse and purchase. But we see an opportunity to do even more, to think differently about the intersection of physical, digital and social. So consumers can discover Target products wherever they're spending their time. So you'll hear from Christina and Cara this morning, we're going to keep building our capabilities in omnichannel discovery since we see this as an advantage that's ownable over our retail rivals.\n So I've thrown a lot on the table, and there's more definition and detail to come. Having tackled both industry and in-house challenges over the last couple of years, I can tell you, I'm not satisfied. And our team is not satisfied with our recent top line results. We wanted to be even further along than we are today, but we're confident in our path forward, and we're eager to share what's next. Target is not just a bigger company than it was 10 years ago. It's stronger, healthier and more resilient, a company that's flipping the switch from go time to grow time.\n Over the next hour or so, I'll ask Christina, Rick, Jill, Cara and Michael, to add some texture to those claims. Thanks again for being here. Christina, over to you. Michael, thank you. As we get ready to take your questions, I might get started with some of the questions I can imagine are on your mind this morning. First, are the updates we shared enough to get Target back to growth? The answer is absolutely. We're confident that the road map we've outlined today puts our core strengths, capabilities and points of difference to work in new ways with even greater value, relevance, ease for our current guests and U.S. consumers more broadly. This road map will help us meet consumers where they are to drive traffic, profitable sales growth, and long-term market share gains.\n Another question might be, can Target keep building on the profit improvement you put up last year. You just heard it for Michael, nearly $2 billion in 2023 of operating income growth, far outpacing our guidance. More than $0.5 billion in cost savings from our ongoing efficiency efforts, giving us a fast start on our multiyear efficiency goals and realistic expectations for additional improvement in our operating margin rate this year as we move towards our 6% goal. Ultimately, I'm sure you're asking, what does this mean for shareholders over time? And that brings us back to our emphasis on long-term horizons and the durability of our business model.\n Again, you heard it from Michael. From 2013 to 2023, revenue grew by almost 50%, while earnings per share and the annual dividend more than doubled. The progress we made last year in shifting the momentum of our business, defining our road map for growth and improving our profit performance has set us up to resume share repurchase, potentially later this year. We know that's been an important source of shareholder returns over time. But since most of you know our capital priorities as well as we do at this point, I'm guessing you noticed that I'm ending with the priority that's been on top of the list for decades. Simply put, investing in the right strategies and capabilities for our consumers and our business is a surest way to deliver outstanding shareholder returns over decades.\n As you've seen in the last decade, there's a lot we can't control in the operating environment, but we are in charge of our financial decisions and the business plans and investments that drive our performance. We know that if we perform well for consumers, their market will reward investors who are fueling those efforts. That's why you've seen us highlight our road map this morning. It reflects our team's eagerness to grow, and more importantly, our plan to execute on that ambition. It's how we're putting the assets and capabilities we've built in the last decade to work in ways that are inspiring and in step with how consumers will be shopping in the next decade. \n Keep in mind strengths that are unique to us, a comprehensive competitive position, a position that's difficult to replicate because no one can put it all together like Target. We've said it before, it's the power of [ brand ], from our stores and digital experiences to our fulfillment options, our multi-category portfolio, our signature brand partnerships, our own brand [indiscernible] and above all, our global team. Our 400,000 Target team members and a talented and dedicated and determined leadership team, who have led and will keep leading our team through go time. But make no mistakes, everyone at Target from the check lane to the C-suite is committed to the next era of grow time. Now we look forward to hearing from you. I'll ask Christina, Cara and Michael to join me back on stage so we can take your questions. Hands are going up, why don't we start right here? Christina, I think that's a great place to start. And you can talk about the work we've done with our global sourcing teams to make sure we are evolving the way we buy goods across the country. I'd only add that even in 2023, as we took a more conservative approach in discretionary categories, Christina, Rick and Jill's teams certainly leaned into key seasonal moments to make sure that we had the right newness, the right affordability as guests continue to celebrate those key seasonal moments. We'll do more of that in 2024 as we continue to make sure we adjust our flexibility to meet the needs of guests as they continue to change their shopping patterns. Let's go over on the side. Michael. I'm happy to start, Michael. And we're not going to provide you the waterfall today that breaks all those components apart, but everything you've talked about is baked into our plans. We certainly expect new stores to be a major contributor as we go forward. Michael talked about, over a decade, we expect those 300 new stores to generate about $15 billion of incremental revenue. We'll continue to invest in remodels. And we've got a long track record of seeing those remodels deliver really good returns. \n We'll continue to lean into our own brands, our national brands and those great brand partnerships to make sure we're providing our guests with the newness and inspiration they're looking for. We're very excited. As you heard from Cara about the new Target Circle program, the benefits of that base program, circle card and the excitement around Target 360 and how that will extend our same-day offering to guests, bring it right to their home within an hour. \n So each one of those elements play a key role. We're very excited about the enhancements we've made from an overall digital standpoint to provide more ease and inspiration and discovery for our guests. And both Michael and Cara talked about the upward potential we see in Roundel. So they'll all play a key role as we go forward. But I think it fundamentally starts with us understanding consumer trends, how consumers are shopping today and we'll shop differently going forward and continue to meet their needs, no matter how they want to shop with Target. Either in a physical store, in a digital environment, whether it starts with social or they're just walking into a great neighborhood Target store. So each element is going to contribute to our road map for growth. \n And underneath all of that is that continued focus on retail fundamentals, the blocking and tackling that makes sure we provide our guests a great physical and digital experience, making sure we're always in stock that we leverage our crux, that we provide great affordability and we're there to provide a great guest experience no matter how you shop with our brand. How about right back here. Yes. Michael, I'm happy to start because I know it's a topic on everyone's mind. And when I think about shortage, when I think about shrink, I'll start with the word progress. I think we're seeing really solid progress and greater awareness at the national, state and local level. And certainly, our teams have been working to ensure we provide a great guest experience and provide an experience that's safe for our team and safe for our guests. And Michael, I think our teams have made significant progress, but a lot more to come. All right. Just roll it back here. Yes. Michael, I'd only add that taking a very measured approach to setting priorities year-by-year. We see opportunities in stores, in supply chain, opportunities to better leverage technology to continue to build on that efficiency road map. So year after year, we'll reset priorities to make sure we're laser-focused on delivering those results, and they'll build over time. All right. Back over here. Cara, I'll let you take it away. I just want to take this moment and I hope many of our leaders back home are listening and just thank the Circle team, the teams have been working on this program for months and months. Our tech teams have been supporting them and the entire effort that the organization has put behind bringing this forward today. As you can doubt, we are really excited about the future Target Circle and think it's going to be a major growth driver and deepen guest relevance and bring new consumers into the target franchise. All right. Back up front. Ed, it's a great question. I'm happy to start. And actually, over the last couple of years, you've seen us move from a focus on small stores, and we can talk about the performance there to more larger-sized stores as we see new opportunities and catchments where we haven't competed in the past. And we've been very pleased with the performance of these new full-size stores as well as the continued performance in urban centers and on college campuses. \n So as we look at our pipeline going forward, we recognize there's opportunities for more full-size stores, extend our proximity, bring the best of Target into some new trading areas. And as part of that, you will see us continue to expand our food and beverage offering. Rick talked about the progress we've seen in food and beverage and adding over $8 billion in the last couple of years and the strength of a brand like Good & Gather and for many of you who are tracking the consumer packaged goods industry, there aren't a lot of $4 billion brands out there. \n And we launched that brand just prior to the pandemic. And we just continue to see the steady growth and how our guests react to the quality and value we bring with Good & Gather. So we're excited about the pipeline. It will be more larger-sized stores. There will be a broader food offering. And we're going to be moving into trade areas where we can pick up incremental volume and market share because we, in many cases, just haven't competed in these trade areas in the past. Michael, do you want to talk about some of the returns we're seeing with some of our smaller stores. And I'd add 3 more points as we think about small formats. And we're here in Manhattan. 10 years ago, we really didn't have a brand presence in Manhattan. Today, we have over a dozen locations, and we're in many of the different neighborhoods across the city. We've now been connecting with a consumer that we couldn't reach in the past. And we're going to build a long-term relationship there. We're on many college campuses across the country. We know the value of building a connection with college students while they're on campus and the lifelong benefits that's going to provide for our brand as they move into their first apartment or have their first child and start their families. And one of the other things like Christina build on it is the work we've done with smaller formats has allowed us to understand a lot more about segmentation and getting the assortment right geography by geography. \n So as we move into new markets, we're going to get much better at segmentation, having the right assortment that reflects the demand in those local markets. So there have been 3 really important benefits of our small format journey. We're touching new cities where we didn't have our presence in the past. We'll build a lifelong connection with college students, and we've learned a lot more about segmenting our assortment. Cara, one of the things you and I talked a lot is as we open up new stores, there's certainly a physical store component. We drive a lot of new revenue. But there's also benefits from a digital standpoint as we introduce the brand to new communities, you want to expand on some of the things we've learned. All right. We've got time for a couple more questions. Let's go up here. Well, Michael, this is a surprise. We've made it all the way to the last few minutes of our conference today, and this is the first time we've had a question about gross margin. Okay. Go back here. So Cara, why don't you start with partnerships? And Christina, why don't you talk about some of the learning that we have around how we build assortments? I'll just finished up that discussion by saying, I think we've learned time and time again. We make really good decisions when we listen to the guests and listen to the broader consumer trends. Some of the things we rolled out recently. Starbucks for our Drive Up guest. We didn't come up with that. They was the guest saying, \"Well, if Target could only provide me with my favorite Starbucks product, I'd enjoy this drive experience even more.\" If you could take my returns, I would really be pleased. So we respond to what the guests and the consumer tells us, and that's going to guide us for years to come. All right. We've got time for one final question. So I guess we're going right over here. Michael, why don't you start with the second half, and I'll wrap up with Chris' first question. And Chris, from a market share standpoint, I can assure everyone here, we look at market share in a very granular way every single week across our entire portfolio. And we're going to be very focused on taking market share as we go forward. I'll step back, not just look at the last year, but the last several years. And if I go all the way back to the prepandemic, we've added billions and billions of dollars of revenue growth. I think, Michael, over $30 billion. \n And we've deepened our relationship with guests along the way. We've added more capabilities and features. We've deepened partnerships. And those are going to guide us to be even a more relevant retailer and partner for consumers and guests for years to come. So we are very focused right now over not just the next year, but the next 10 years, to continue to drive even more traffic to our stores and visit store site to make sure we are a company that's driving top line growth because we know that's the best way to reward our shareholders. \n And we are absolutely going to be razor-focused on taking market share as we go forward. And sitting here today, we know there are significant opportunities across virtually every aspect of our portfolio, whether it's the work that Jill is leading and apparel and home or the work Rick is doing from a food and beverage standpoint and a beauty and essential standpoint, whether it's physical stores or digital, we see a pathway for continued market share growth, and we'll look at that every single week and talk about it every quarter because we know that's critically important to our road map for growth. \n So I appreciate everyone who joined us in person today. Those of you who have joined us through the video and the conference. Thanks so much. We look forward to seeing you and hearing from you during our first quarter earnings report. So thank you so much."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Cara just mentioned, I've recently taken on a new role. And while I'll be staying on as CFO for a little while longer, I'm honored and excited to be leading our incredible operations team as Chief Operating Officer. As an engineer by training, I've always had a passion and respect for the work of my new team. And I've learned a lot working with them and alongside them during my 20-plus years at Target. As John Hulbert would tell you, over the years, I've often added complexity to our investor travel. So we could squeeze in just one more store visit.\n And throughout the recent holiday season and so far this new year, it's been great to have an opportunity to spend even more time with teams in both our stores and supply chain facilities. While our financial conversations often focus on the metrics we use to assess our performance, there's no substitute for seeing firsthand the strength of our operations, the benefits that come from well-managed inventory and newness and hearing our talented team is focused on building for the future. \n So before I move into the financial portion of my remarks, I'm going to spend a few minutes on my priorities as I move into this new role. And as I've mentioned to my new team, I'm coming into this job at a time when our operations are in a very strong position. As such, my top priority is to build on the foundation that John Mulligan and the team have already established, and I'm fortunate to have an outstanding group of leaders already in place. As you've heard from John over the years, the operations team is focused on advancing multiple long-term initiatives to expand our footprint, modernize how we support our business and advance our company strategy. These efforts begin with investments in our store network, developing new locations, remodeling existing ones, supporting key partnerships like Ulta Beauty, enhancing our same-day services and more.\n We're also transforming our supply chain. This includes our journey to automate upstream replenishment with a focus on reducing store workload and increasing reliability. It also includes the build-out of our sortation center network, which offers faster delivery times while meaningfully reducing the cost of last mile delivery. Beyond this investment in our infrastructure, we're partnering with teams across the company to enhance our inventory positioning and demand forecasting, leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance our speed, consistency and efficiency. And of course, we're focused on the support and development of our team, including their pay, benefits, training and well-being. As I've said consistently, during my time as CFO, our team is our most valuable asset, and I'm bringing that perspective into my new role.\n As Christina mentioned earlier, beginning last year, our team renewed their focus on retail fundamentals after several years of managing through unusually high volatility. These efforts focus first on in-stocks, but encompass a broad array of measures relating to guest experience. In total last year, our store teams rolled out new training on 25 separate best practices, and we've seen the benefit in our recent guest surveys. While those initial improvements are encouraging, we'll continue on that journey throughout this year to ensure we're setting the standard for the shopping experience in U.S. retail.\n So now let me turn to our financial results. And while our focus today is on the future, I'm also going to give a look back for perspective on our longer-term trajectory. I'll begin with a review of last year's financial performance and then compare and then examine how it compares with a decade ago. With that context, I'll look ahead to our aspirations over the next 10 years and conclude with our outlook for 2024. It's clear that last year was unusual as top line results came in below our guidance, but our bottom line performance came in well ahead of expectations. For the full year, we saw a 3.7% decline in our comparable sales, reflecting quarterly traffic trends that varied widely from the strongest performance in Q1 to the softest in Q2 and an improving trend in Q3 and Q4.\n As traffic improved, we saw a better comp sales trend, better digital sales and a dramatic improvement in discretionary categories. On the operating margin line, our business delivered dollar growth of nearly $2 billion last year, well beyond our initial guidance of $1 billion or more. This was driven by a rebound in our operating margin rate from historic lows in 2022, a year where we faced unusually high markdown rates, sky high freight and transportation costs and rising rates of inventory shrink. \n Last year, as the team managed inventory really well, markdown rates improved dramatically, and we saw a huge reduction in freight and transportation costs more than we expected as we entered the year. Healthy inventory levels also helped our operations, without the need to manage overfilled backrooms, store teams were able to flow product onto their sales floor more easily and increase their focus on guest-facing work.\n Similarly, our supply chain facilities were able to operate more smoothly without the necessary labor hours and extra touch is required to manage overly full buildings. Last year, we also benefited meaningfully from the efficiency efforts we launched about a year ago. When we began this work, we said we expected to realize $2 billion to $3 billion in permanent efficiency gains over a 3-year period. And with the first of those 3 years behind us, we continue to feel very good about our progress. More specifically, we estimate that these efforts delivered savings of more than $0.5 billion last year helping to offset other profit pressures, including the deleveraging effect of a soft top line, continued investments and paying benefits for our team and higher inventory shrink. And finally, last year, we continued to benefit from our Roundel ad business, which grew more than 20% in a year when we were facing challenging trends on the top line.\n Altogether, last year's profit performance led to growth in our GAAP and adjusted EPS of nearly $3 or just under 50% compared with the prior year. In addition, cash from operations more than doubled from $4 billion in 2022 to $8.6 billion last year. And finally, after-tax return on invested capital expanded by well over 3 percentage points from 12.6% in 2022 to 16.1% last year. \n Before I include my recap of 2023, I want to provide an update on inventory shrink, which includes the impact of retail theft. Last year, consistent with expectations, shrink cost increased more than $500 million compared with 2022, representing about 50 basis points of incremental rate pressure. Even more notable, compared with 2019, shrink costs have reduced our operating margin rate by a cumulative 1.2 percentage points over a 4-year period. \n Happily, we've seen some encouraging trends recently resulting from both the actions we've taken and the community efforts we're seeing across the country. I want to pause and give a quick shout out to our assets protection and information security teams who are working around the clock to protect the safety of our team and our guests. I'll add, however, that because it's a lagging metric, we're planning for shrink rates to remain approximately flat in 2024. So now with last year in the books, I want to briefly pull back the lens and look back over the last decade, which is a very long time in retail. This will help to highlight the journey we've been on and the capabilities we've developed serving as the foundation for the next decade of profitable growth. As you all know, the last 10 years were a time of rapid change in retail. \n This led to some sluggish results at Target in the early years as our business faced some significant challenges. Those periods were followed by rapid progress in later years based on the steps we took to address those challenges. Let's start with the top line. In 2013, our U.S. business generated about $71 billion in sales, while 2023 sales were about $34.5 billion higher, representing an average growth rate of about 4% per year, breaking down that growth by channel, about $16.5 billion occurred in our stores, while digital sales grew by another $18 billion becoming nearly 13x larger over that decade.\n Within our digital sales, same-day services, which didn't exist 10 years ago, accounted for $12.5 billion or 70% of our digital growth between 2013 and 2023. On the bottom line, our adjusted EPS in the U.S. grew by an average of about 7.6% per year from $4.29 in 2013 to $8.94 last year, while GAAP EPS from continuing operations grew slightly faster. \n On top of those EPS gains, our per share dividend grew at an average rate of 10.7% per year from $1.58 in 2013 to $4.36 last year. I'd note that these bottom line returns were delivered during a decade in which our operating profitability experienced a meaningful amount of compression from a 6.7% operating margin rate in 2013 to 5.3% last year. As we experienced significant pressure from inventory shrink and higher digital penetration. Going forward, we expect to offset at least a portion of this decline over time as we work to achieve an optimal and sustainable operating margin rate.\n Turning to capital deployment. Our priorities have remained consistent for decades. So I'll briefly reiterate them here. We first look to reinvest capital in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our 52-year record of annual increases in the dividend per share. And finally, we deploy any excess cash after these first two uses to repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. Over the last decade, our operations generated just over $67 billion of cash. And during that time, the lowest level of any single year was still more than $4 billion. These cash returns demonstrate the durability of our business as we navigated through several challenging periods over those 10 years. \n They also give us a lot of confidence in our prospects for making continued productive investments in the years ahead. Throughout that entire decade, deployment of cash was consistent with our long-term priorities. Just over $30 billion was devoted to CapEx, accounting for about 45% of the total. Another $14.5 billion was paid as dividends and cumulative share repurchases accounted for the remainder of just over $22 billion as we retired more than 206 million shares at an average price of about $108, all while maintaining our Middle A ratings over the entire period.\n So now with that long-term look back as context, I want to turn to what we expect to achieve over the next 10 years, beginning with the top line, where we're focused on 3 separate growth drivers: comparable sales, new stores and other revenue. Comps are expected to be the primary source of growth with increases in the low to mid-single-digit range in a normal year, consistent with our average over the last decade. We'll support this comp growth with continued investments in our business in remodels, own brands, national brands, signature partnerships and value-added services across all channels.\n Turning to remodels. We plan to invest in the vast majority of our nearly 2,000 store fleet over the next 10 years. Each year, projects will range from full-scale remodels in which we touch the entire store to more surgical investments, including the addition of Ulta Beauty locations, fixture upgrades, support of our same-day services and more. On top of existing stores, we'll continue opening new locations based on the strong financial returns they generate. \n As Brian mentioned, most of these new stores will be larger on average than we've opened in recent years. Based on the opportunities we've already identified, we expect to open more than 300 additional stores over the next decade, meaningfully extending our reach into new neighborhoods. By the end of those 10 years, we expect those new stores will be generating incremental sales of around $15 billion annually.\n Beyond our buildings, we'll continue to focus on the well-being of our team members who enable our growth and serve as the face of Target every day. As Christina and Cara highlighted earlier, the human element as exemplified by our team as a continued differentiator for Target in a world where commerce is becoming increasingly mechanized and impersonal. Finally, over the next decade, we expect to continue seeing outsized growth in other revenue. This has been driven in recent years by our Roundel ad business, which contributed more than $1.5 billion of value to Target last year to the benefit of both gross margin and other revenue. On top of Roundel, we also expect our digital marketplace, Target Plus, to make a more meaningful contribution over the next 10 years.\n Putting this all together, over the next decade, we expect our total revenue will grow by an average rate of roughly 4% per year over the next 10 years. If we attain that goal, our business will add more than $50 billion of revenue on top of the $107 billion we delivered in 2023. That growth will enable our business to further benefit from scale efficiencies as we continue to extend our reach in the U.S. market. On the operating margin line, our ambition is to reach the optimal rate to maximize profit dollar growth over time. While we don't yet know what that rate will be, we believe it will be at least the size our prepandemic rate of 6%. We made enormous progress and moving back towards 6% last year and expect to make continued progress in 2024 and beyond.\n Once we reach that 6% milestone, we'd be happy to continue moving higher as long as we're seeing appropriate dollar growth. For example, if we're successful in reducing shrink over the next few years, that might support our ability to sustainably operate above 6% over time. Regarding CapEx, we don't apply a rule of thumb to determine annual spending. Rather, we maintain a bottom-up plan and allocate capital to all the projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. As you've seen in recent years, annual CapEx will vary based on the external backdrop and individual project investments, which naturally follow the evolving needs of the business will vary as we snap this chalk line in a specific year.\n For example, while in 2022, we needed to rapidly expand our upstream replenishment capacity. We're no longer feeling that same urgency today. Similarly, while we love what we're seeing in our sortation centers and expect to meaningfully grow their capacity over time, the pacing of sort center investments has slowed somewhat in the near term given the brown box last mile delivery volumes declined significantly last year. When we put together all of those considerations, along with our long-term growth ambitions, we believe annual CapEx will typically range between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2025 and beyond. Regarding our second capital priority, we expect to continue growing the per share dividend over the next decade and we'll manage the rate of annual increases with a goal of reaching a 40% payout ratio over time.\n As for our third capital priority, we expect share repurchases will continue to play a meaningful role in our EPS growth in years ahead. Our strong balance sheet successfully absorbed a number of powerful shocks in 2022. And last year, we made significant progress in moving our debt metrics back to appropriate levels. This sets the stage for a potential resumption and repurchase activity later this year. Altogether, we believe we can deliver high single-digit growth in earnings per share in a typical year, at or above the average you've seen over the last 10 years. And lastly, we believe our after-tax ROIC can continue to move higher into the teens over the next decade -- into the high teens over the next decade. \n So now let me turn briefly to our expectations for 2024. On the top line, we're still planning cautiously, given the consumer spending patterns we've seen for 2 full years now. More specifically, on the discretionary side of our business, even as we've seen improving trends over the last 2 quarters, overall demand remains soft as spending patterns continue to normalize from pandemic peaks. In our frequency businesses, we're anticipating a further recovery in unit trends this year as inflation continues to moderate. Altogether, we're planning for a modest increase in comparable sales in the 0% to 2% range for the year. Within the year, our top line will face the highest hurdle in the first quarter, while over the remainder of the year, we'll be comparing over notably softer results. As a result, while we're looking to build on the momentum we've seen in recent quarters, our plans anticipate a comp decline in the first quarter. \n After that, we're planning for a resumption of top line growth over the remaining 3 quarters of the year. On the operating margin line, we expect the impact of inventory shrink will be roughly flat to last year. In addition, given our cautious top line expectations and continued investments in long-term growth, we'll likely see some deleveraging on the SG&A line. In terms of tailwinds, we're planning for modest improvement -- modest rate improvement in shipping and transportation as we annualize the benefit of the lower rate contracts negotiated throughout 2023. We're also planning for continued outsized growth in our Roundel ad business, contributing to both gross margin and other revenue. And of course, we expect our efficiency work will benefit both our gross margin and SG&A expense rates.\n Altogether, in 2024, we're planning for a modest increase from last year's 5.3% operating margin rate as we continue moving towards our 6% goal. On the bottom line, our 2024 expectations translate to a full year range for both GAAP and adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60. On first glance, the midpoint of this range represents growth of just under 2% versus 2023. However, I'd note that it's equivalent to a mid- to high single-digit increase on a 52- to 52-week basis, given that last year had an extra week. Regarding the first quarter, our full year plans translate to a range of $1.70 to $2.10 for both GAAP and adjusted EPS on an expected 3% to 5% decline in comparable sales. \n Turning to our balance sheet and capital deployment. We continue to expect a CapEx range of $3 billion to $4 billion for the year and are planning for another strong year of cash generation. Later in the year, we'll recommend that our Board approved another increase in our per share dividend. And finally, while we don't expect to repurchase any shares in Q1, we may be able to resume that activity later in the year within the limits of our Middle A ratings. As I get ready to close, I want to pause and thank the entire Target team with a particular call out to my colleagues in finance. It's been an honor to serve as your Chief Financial Officer for the last 4.5 years. Just as I have been, I'm confident my successor will be incredibly grateful for the leadership, integrity, passion and discipline you bring to your work every day. \n Until a successor is named, I'll continue to fully occupy the CFO role and partner with all of you on behalf of Target and our stakeholders. To my new team, I'm incredibly excited to be working with all of you. As I said earlier, our operations are already in great shape, and I'm fortunate to be working with a strong set of leaders. I can't wait to see what we can accomplish together as we build and sustain the foundation for another decade of profitable growth at Target. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Brian for some closing remarks. Yes. And maybe just add on that by kind of reinforcing a point Brian made. I love the fact you can't decompose our strategy and to discrete things. It's how they work together, a guest engaging with circle that finds discretionary category discovery within that experience. And so it's never 1 plus 1 equals 2. We're hoping 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 10. And it's how all of it comes together. You asked a question specifically on the cadence as we move through the year. I touched on it a little bit in my remarks, we anniversaried some of the strongest business last year in Q1, and so we would expect to see a build as we move through 2024. Yes. I mean I can't say enough about the hard work of the teams that have led to that ton of progress that Brian hit on. And the way that rolls into our [indiscernible] is we're expecting shrink to be flat year-over-year. We learned a lot in the first quarter. We inventory a lot of stores in Q1, and so it will be smarter a quarter from now. But that progress has us expecting for a lagging metric flat, and we'll see what we've learned as we go through the year. Yes. Well, I'm happy to start. The teams work against a tough top line to deliver that efficiency progress this year. It's a great start, and I can view that as a down payment toward that $2 billion to $3 billion that we expect to get over time. The things are a little closer in that were highlights of that this year. I'd call out the continued benefits of something like our sortation centers. We have a sortation center in a market ,we're faster and we're cheaper than other forms of delivery. \n I also -- I mean we touched on a little bit in the conversation already, but it warrants another shout out. The benefit of exceptionally well-managed inventory just shows up everywhere. We're so much more productive in-store and in our DCs when inventory is well managed. And so I feel really good about the team's work there in 2023. I feel great about our inventory position as we step into 2024. And I would expect our teams to continue taking the growth we've seen and the growth we expect and to translate that more into more efficiencies over time. So if I start with the questions on the credit side of things, we've seen -- I think we've characterized it throughout the year, kind of an expected return to normal in a lot of those underlying credit metrics. And so you've seen a little bit of softness year-over-year there. Then in 2023, was offset nicely and then some by the incredible growth we've seen in the Roundel business. And as a reminder, I think I said this twice in remarks, Roundel is both a little other revenue and a lot of gross margin. And so it benefits 2 places to get to that $1.5 billion of value in total. But we've seen outsized growth there, and we would expect that to continue this year. We're really confident about our prospects to continue growing our Roundel business to the benefit of the guest that get strong engagement with all of those offers. \n Another example of how the strategy fits together, the more engagement we have with Circle, the better we know our guests. The better we know our guests, the better we can serve them through Roundel. And so we're excited about what growth looks like there. Your second question, Greg, refresh my memory? Yes, we won't break out ticket versus traffic. But the theme I'll talk about that we've seen this year is a moderation of inflation, I think, but disinflation is the word of the quarter in retail. That's a good thing for the consumer. You've heard it for the consumer. You've heard us talk about that being one of the inputs, some share of wallet recovery on the discretionary side of things. And so we're pleased to see that ticket pressure because we think it's a good thing for the U.S. consumer. Yes, we feel really good about the returns of those small stores. And it's great to have that flexibility in kind of our toolbox of what's the right thing to build for the opportunity in a specific market. And to be clear, going forward, if the right opportunity can be fit with a 25,000 square foot box that brings us closer to a college campus or an urban center. We know how to do that. We like the returns, and we'll lean in there. But as we step back, and look at what that pipeline looks like in total. It's actually the big box stores where we're able to bring the best of Target that are bubbling to the top in terms of where we expect returns to be strongest. And so we'll lean in to that shift over time. And if our properties team was here on the stage with us, they could roll out a map of the U.S. and show a bunch of main and main locations where we'd love to bring Targets to new communities, and we feel good about what that pipeline looks like. Excited to get the question as always. We'll, I can start by unpacking a little bit what we saw in Q4, and there's some consistent themes to what we saw in the broader part of the year because the theme of gross margin recovery this year. And I think Q4 and the year, we were just shy of 3 percentage points of improvement in gross margin. Better inventory management, we saved a lot of markdowns and costs that were associated with some of the inventory challenges that we had a couple of years ago.\n So on a year-over-year basis, that's a big source of improvement. Within there too, freight and transportation is in a much better place today from a cost perspective, not all the way back to 2019 levels, but on a year-over-year basis, another significant source of improvement. In addition, we also see benefit from digital and supply chain to the tune of, I think, 50 basis points in the right direction for the quarter and the year. \n And that's a combination of being more productive as inventory levels have been better managed and a little bit of tailwind from fewer brown boxes shipped with our brown box business being down on a year-over-year basis. As we look ahead to next year, all of our best assumptions are wrapped into the EPS guidance we've given. And a little bit of deleveraging, given a cautious view on the top line with some continued improvement in gross margin, we think is going to be the right recipe going forward.\n  When it comes to a Target Circle instead of speaking to any specific assumption within that business case, I think of Target Circle is about growth. When we meet our guests with the right value proposition in a free loyalty program and the right value proposition and Target delivered to your doorstep through Target 360 and if you're looking for 5% more every day, we've got to Target Circle card for you. All of that is about stronger relevancy in growth. \n And so the line of the P&L, I'm most excited about from a Target Circle standpoint is growth. And time and time again, if we think about the P&L through the lens of the guests, we get to the right decisions. It costs us a little bit more to serve a Drive Up order than it does an in-store trip. But when guests start using Drive Up, we've described it before, it continues to be true. They spend 20% to 30% more at Target thereafter. And so we're making decisions with what we think drives the most value and growth in total. Yes. So as we look at the first quarter, I think the key thing there is our cautious approach on the top line, and there's some differences year-over-year in what we anniversary, but that's a source of pressure in the first quarter. As we get back to growth, deeper in the year, we'll see some of that pressure subsides. So that's the headline on that one, Chris."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call.\n [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 15, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. \n On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer.\n In a few moments, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their insights on our third quarter performance, along with our outlook and priorities for the fourth quarter. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.\n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the third quarter, and his priorities for the remainder of the year. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John. For many years now, we have focused on building a durable business model that allows us to meet guests where they are, developing and enhancing the right tools and capabilities while investing heavily in our team, all in the service of providing an affordable, easy and joyful guest experience. And the flexibility of our multi-category model has served us incredibly well over the last few years, delivering unprecedented growth in both traffic and sales.\n Today, our business generates well over $100 billion in annual revenue and is successfully navigating through a very challenging environment as consumers continue to rebalance their spending between goods and experiences and make tough choices in the face of persistent inflation. Even as our P&L is being impacted by multiple top line and bottom line challenges, including soft industry trends in discretionary categories, moderating inflation rates in Essentials and Food and Beverage and higher inventory shrink. We've seen a meaningful improvement in profitability compared with last year.\n More specifically, our EPS through the first 3 quarters of 2023 was more than 40% higher than last year and more than 26% higher than in 2019. Importantly, even beyond this year's rapid progress, we believe we have a significant opportunity to grow both the top line and bottom line in the years ahead. So even as we remain cautious in our near-term outlook, we're not standing still. We're playing the long game, investing in our stores, our supply chain, our team, our digital capabilities and our assortment to provide the newness, value and convenience our guests want for this holiday season and beyond. At the heart of it all is our focus on being our guests' happy place and delivering the joyful shopping experience that makes Target, Target. \n In the third quarter, Target's comparable sales were down 4.9%, in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarters and overall industry trends, discretionary categories were the driver of this decline, partially offset by net sales growth in our frequency categories. Between sales channels, store comp trends were somewhat stronger than in the digital channel. Among our digital fulfillment capabilities, same-day services saw high single-digit comp growth led by Drive-Up, which expanded 12%. Strength in these services was offset by continued softness in brown box delivery, which is most affected by the pullback in discretionary categories. \n On the bottom line, our third quarter EPS of $2.10 was well above our expectations and more than 36% ahead of last year. This increase reflected the continued benefit of lower freight costs, disciplined inventory management by our team, favorable category and channel mix and the continued benefit of our work to enhance efficiency, which offset multiple pressures throughout our business. This is outstanding profit performance in the face of a very challenging environment, and I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts in support of our guests, our business and each other.\n As you know, one of our top priorities this year was to rebuild our profitability following the unique challenges we faced in 2022. And while there's lots more work ahead of us, I'm really pleased with the progress the team has delivered so far this year. At the same time, I want to make it clear. We are not satisfied with the top line trends we've been seeing. Our #1 priority is to get back to sustainable growth in both traffic and sales, and we're committed to investing in long-term initiatives to deliver this growth.\n As we assess the external environment, it's clear that consumers have been remarkably resilient. Yet at the same time, our research indicates that themes like uncertainty, caution, managing my time and budget and focusing on essentials while still finding ways to celebrate are all top of mind. Overall, consumers are still spending, but pressures like higher interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayments, increased credit card debt and reduced savings rates, have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade-offs in their family budgets.\n For example, this year, we've seen more and more consumers delaying their spending until the last moment. Guests who previously bought sweatshirts or denim in August or September are deciding to wait until the weather turns cold before making a purchase. This is a clear indication of the pressures they're facing as they work to stretch their budgets until the next paycheck. \n Consistent with these pressures, as we look at recent trends across the retail industry, dollar sales are being driven by higher prices with consumers buying fewer units per trip. In fact, overall unit demand across the industry has been down 2% to 4% in recent quarters. And the industry has experienced 7 consecutive quarters of declines in discretionary dollars and units. And while we're happy to see inflation rates moderating this year, if you compare industry pricing in key categories back to 2020, food at home pricing for families has increased 25% overall and in some areas, up to 30%. And if you're a parent raising a baby, you're facing increases of more than 30% on baby food and formula, too. And that's in addition to persistent increases in a variety of other categories.\n So when you layer on the impact of higher energy prices, it all puts pressure on discretionary spending. As a result, this holiday season, we're focusing on highlighting the amazing value we've always provided in our end caps, promotions and the price points we feature in our marketing. As we built our plans for this holiday season, we maintained our cautious inventory positioning in markdown-sensitive categories. This provides our team the necessary flexibility to quickly adjust to volatile trends, something that has served us well all year.\n But I want to be crystal clear. That does not mean we're backing off on newness. While we're cautious about the size of our inventory commitments, we're leaning into the amount of innovation featured in our assortment. And after several years in which our vendors were focused on raising production volumes in the face of unprecedented demand, we're encouraged by the focus on newness and innovation we're seeing from them. And as I've mentioned, throughout this holiday season, we'll be focused on highlighting value, helping families to celebrate the joy of the season in a way that fits their budget.\n Beyond our assortment, as we work to provide a great guest experience, we've enhanced our training of retail fundamentals to our teams. This is an important shift after years of operating in an environment that was anything but normal. After all, given the large number of team members we've hired over the last few years, a meaningful number of them have never experienced ordinary sales trends.\n As we've said many times, investments in our team are the most important ones we make. And today, we remain on our front foot, investing to ensure they can deliver a joyful industry-leading shopping experience. This holiday season, we'll be supplementing our existing team by hiring nearly 100,000 seasonal team members to meet expected demand and ensure we can deliver a joyful shopping experience.\n So now as I get ready to hand the call over to Christina, I think it would be useful to pause and assess how this year has progressed in comparison to our expectations. As a reminder, at the beginning of this year, we said we were expecting a challenging environment with the sales guidance range centered around flat comparable sales. In terms of profitability, we said we expected to grow our full year operating income by $1 billion or more with an expected EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75.\n So today, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, top line trends have obviously been tougher than expected, and we're firmly focused on getting back to growth. But the story on profitability has been very different. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, we've already grown operating income by more than $1 billion compared with last year despite unexpected headwinds from higher-than-expected shrink and softer-than-expected sales. We're encouraged with this performance against a challenging backdrop, which demonstrates the resilience of both our team and our business. I'm incredibly proud to be a member of this great team and excited about the growth we're positioned to deliver in the years ahead. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we've shared for the past several quarters now, even as our guests face tough choices as they manage their budgets, they're also continuing to celebrate seasonal moments while showing their excitement for new product offerings and compelling value. After all, consumers are feeling the weight of multiple economic pressures and discretionary retail has borne the brunt of this weight for many quarters now.\n In addition, consumers are facing newly emerging headwinds, including higher interest rates and the return of student loan payments. In the face of this mental and emotional tug of war, consumers are looking for a respite, which is why we are relentless in our pursuit to provide ease, inspiration, joy and comprehensive value every day. And while we are not satisfied with our current performance, I'm confident that our team's empathy and their continued focus on serving our guests' wants and needs, will pay dividends in the years ahead.\n As Brian mentioned, our third quarter comparable sales decline reflected continued softness in discretionary categories, partially offset by growth in Beauty. Notably, comps within frequency categories slowed between Q2 and Q3, driven entirely by a deceleration in the comp benefit from growth in average retail. More specifically, in both Food and Beverage and Beauty and Essentials, the benefit from average pricing decelerated by about 3 percentage points between the second and third quarters as we move beyond the period of peak inflation from a year ago. As we've said, a lower inflation rate is welcome news as it will reduce pressure on consumer budgets, making room for them to expand back into discretionary categories over time. \n Beauty-led performance in the quarter with comparable sales growth in the high single digits driven by strength across core Beauty and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings. We're excited to launch Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in the third quarter, and it has quickly become one of our top-selling beauty brands across the chain. In Food and Beverage, comp sales were down slightly to last year. Seasonal candy, snacks and hosting solutions performed particularly well. Comp sales in Essentials declined in the low single digits despite strength in health care and baby categories. \n Comp sales in our discretionary categories remained soft in the third quarter with declines ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. However, trends improved markedly compared with the second quarter, thanks to the agility of our team and their focus on listening and responding to our guests. Home saw a high single-digit comp decline, an improvement of more than 6 percentage points from the second quarter. Most notably, we saw strength in Back-to-School and college categories and a great response to our assortment of Stanley drinkware. \n Additionally, within kitchenware, we launched our most recent owned brand, Figmint, and received an enthusiastic response from our guests. Figmint offers more than 250 items, ranging from enameled cookware to ceramic mixing bowls to kitchen gadgets all at a quality, aesthetic and value that can't be topped.\n Apparel comparable sales also declined high single digits, an improvement of nearly 3 percentage points when compared with Q2. The business was strongest within new offerings, including our partnership with Kendra Scott jewelry, the latest All In Motion performance wear and new fall fashion sets within our women's categories. Hardlines comparable sales were down in the low teens. While we were encouraged by Back-to-School performance, demand for electronics remains particularly soft.\n This quarter's performance demonstrates that while the results are not immune to macro conditions, when we focus on retail fundamentals, offer exciting new products at incredible value and respond to our guests' wants and needs in a timely manner, we remain relevant with our guests, even against the challenging backdrop. By leaning into seasonal moments like Back-to-School, Back-to-College and Halloween, we not only drove sales in the current quarter, we helped to build lasting affinity with our guests. This focus on celebrating the season creates an engaging experience that keeps Target top of mind.\n And that's why we continue to offer events like our latest Target Circle week in early October, which added another 500,000 members to our loyalty platform, providing future opportunities to engage with these guests in deeper ways. Our goal this holiday season is to create the perfect combination of incredible value, inspiring and fresh products and a joyful shopping experience as you stroll the aisles in our stores or on the recently refreshed Target website and app.\n We aim to deepen the relationships with our guests as they look to deck the halls and celebrate the joys that the holidays bring. As we do year round, we are leaning into the power of and this holiday season by not focusing only on one aspect of our strategy, but celebrating how they all work together to create a unique offering in a crowded retail landscape.\n Our plans start with a celebratory experience that you feel the moment you walk into our stores or open the Target website or app, featuring on-trend and inspiring color pallets, imagery and in-store marketing that complements all the excitement and joy, we are creating with our national marketing campaigns. Guests will feel the holiday spirit before they even add their first item to the cart. The excitement builds with our assortment at unbeatable value only at Target-exclusive merchandise and our easy and convenient holiday solutions. \n And through it all, we'll remain diligent on executing the necessary retail fundamentals our guests want and expect from us, including being in-stock on the must-have items of the season, offering unmatched value and pricing, highlighting our inspiring and differentiated merchandise assortment and making each trip easy and convenient regardless of where, when and how guests chooses to shop. \n Whether a guest knows exactly what they're looking for or needs a bit of inspiration, we want to make the trip joyful, easy and welcoming. And we know families want to celebrate the holidays, but they're relying on us to help them do so affordably. With a combination of everyday low prices, compelling promotions and exciting savings events all season long, we aim to be the holiday destination for affordable joy.\n So with Thanksgiving right around the corner, guest shopping for food and beverage area will discover how we're helping families celebrate with a Thanksgiving meal that includes all the family favorites for under $25, featuring $0.99 per pound Good & Gather turkeys and the must-have sides for just $5.

And so far, among the most popular toys in our assortment are All Things Target, including plush Bullseye dogs, Barbie First Job at Target Dolls and Target cash register and shopping cart toys, a nod to the Target brand love, even among our youngest guests.\n And back by popular demand, we have an exciting array of toys from FAO Schwarz, including only-at-Target exclusives with 50% of the assortment under $20.

Nearly 2/3 of the assortment will be priced under $20 with in-store and digital signing and displays, making it easy for guests to see how they can refresh their holiday decor affordably with $15 ornament sets, family baking solutions and Mondo Llama craft sets, $10 throw pillows and tree skirts and still much more.\n And of course, the season is all about gathering with loved ones. Guests will find all the best entertaining, gifting and gathering solutions in this year's assortment, and we're launching more than 100 new items in Good & Gather and Favorite Day, with over half of these priced under $5.\n Throughout the holiday season, guests can rest assured that they'll get the best price and quality, wherever and however they shop. We'll be offering incredible deals leading up to Black Friday, including 4 weeks of deals on tens of thousands of items with many up to 50% off. Target Circle members will receive exclusive promotions and offers to reward and deepen their love of All Things Target. Plus, we've added more personalization than ever before, giving them even more options to earn rewards. And of course, we'll offer our season-long price match guarantee, which assures guests that no matter when they shop, they'll get the best price of the season.\n The holidays are so special to so many families, and they are made even brighter by everything our team members do for our guests and for each other. I'm so inspired by how each of our teams from marketing to merchandising to stores to supply chain are bringing their best to create something truly magical and uniquely target this holiday season. I want to thank the entire Target team around the world for being the not-so-secret weapon that will help us to win the holiday season. \n As I get ready to end my remarks, John, I want to pause and thank you and acknowledge your countless contributions to the Target brand and team. I've greatly appreciated getting to work alongside you for so many years and know your legacy will be felt for many more. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to you. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. Over the last 3.5 years, our operations have continually faced unusual and rapidly changing external conditions. In 2020 and 2021, after the onset of the pandemic, we couldn't secure enough inventory to satisfy the explosion in demand for our products, and we saw operating margin rates grow well beyond normal levels. Then in early 2022, the period of rapid growth in discretionary categories suddenly reversed, and we quickly moved from having too little inventory to having way too much. As a result, both our distribution centers and store backrooms filled up well beyond optimal levels and operating margin rates quickly moved to historical lows.\n So this year, as Brian mentioned, a key priority was to optimize our inventory position so it was better aligned to the current size and growth rate of our business. We were confident that if we were successful in that effort, our operations will become more efficient, markdowns will come back down, and we'd see our profit rate recover back toward more sustainable long-term levels. And through the first 3 quarters of the year, despite unexpectedly soft top line trends, the team has delivered a more rapid recovery in our profitability than we'd even planned at the beginning of the year.\n Looking ahead, we've maintained this cautious inventory posture and planning for the fourth quarter as well. More specifically, at the end of the third quarter, total inventory on our balance sheet was 14% lower than a year ago with discretionary category inventory down 19%. And importantly, while this ending inventory position was 29% higher than at the end of Q3 2019, that's aligned with growth we've seen on the sales line over those 4 years, making us feel really good about both the size and the health of our inventory position as we enter the holiday season.\n In addition, even though we own a lot less inventory than a year ago, the team has delivered meaningfully improved reliability and in-stock metrics this year, and they made additional progress in Q3. More specifically, overall in-stocks in the third quarter improved nearly 1 percentage point compared with Q2 and more than 3 percentage points from a year ago. And notably, in-stocks in our highest volume stores saw an even greater year-over-year improvement. \n In terms of our top-selling items, while the in-stock rate remained consistent between Q2 and Q3, that was after we grew the size of that list by about 75%, meaning that today, our top item list accounts for more than 1/3 of our total sales. Beyond these broader metrics, we also saw meaningful improvements in our seasonal in-stocks and a more than 6 percentage point improvement in new item in-stocks. \n In our smaller stores, which on average have less shelf capacity and turn faster than the chain, in-stocks have improved by more than 2 percentage points between the first and third quarters. And today, our in-stock levels in those stores are slightly better than the overall chain. And finally, in the digital channel, the percent of items available for purchase has improved by more than 2 points compared with last year, reflecting an improvement of nearly 8 percentage points in Apparel.\n Beyond the work of our team to deliver these outstanding improvements, we're benefiting from a more than 2-week reduction of import lead times compared with last year and a nearly 10 percentage point improvement in purchase order fill rates compared with a year ago. And with the combined benefit of a faster supply chain and a simultaneous reduction in inventory levels, all of our supply chain facilities stayed at or below our desired capacity thresholds through all 13 weeks of the third quarter this year compared with only 3 of 13 weeks in Q3 of 2022. So while we'll continue to focus on ways to consistently deliver higher in-stocks and reliability, I'm incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished so far this year. \n So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to highlight how our team continues to deliver on their efforts to improve execution of everyday retail fundamentals as we prepare for the busiest shopping season of the year. One of the key areas of focus for our store teams this year was to ensure priority items remained available on our sales floors throughout the day. And this year, through these efforts, we've increased the amount of inventory available on our sales floors by more than $0.25 billion. \n In addition, we've seen improvements in metrics relating to backroom inventory accuracy and the percent of new assortments set on time. In the digital channel, the percentage of orders picked and shipped on time and the average Drive-Up wait time have all improved from last year. Also in support of the digital business, the percent of items ordered but not found has declined from a year ago, meaning that we are fulfilling more items per order and canceling fewer, a key factor in guest satisfaction. \n Since our goal is for Target to be the easiest place for our guests to shop, our teams have been focused on the front of store experience with the goal of providing consistently great service through the in-store checkout experience, along with drive-up and in-store pickup. And because our guests tell us they enjoy interacting with our team, since we've refocused on the front-end experience, we've seen more than a 6 percentage point increase in the usage of full service lanes across the chain. And we've seen sustained month-over-month improvement in the Net Promoter Score relating to interactions with our team at checkout. In addition, compared with last year, we've seen improvements in Net Promoter Scores for both Drive Up and in-store pickup on top of already high levels a year ago.\n Beyond the front of store, in support of our efforts to highlight value and affordability, our team has been working to increase the number of store end caps featuring 1 or 2 price points. As a result, going into this holiday season, nearly 2/3 of our end caps were meeting the standard and conveying a simple, compelling and easy-to-understand value message. \n Finally, I want to provide a quick update on our goal of hiring 100,000 seasonal team members to join our team and provide a great guest experience during the holiday season. I'm happy to report that our hiring stats this year have improved relative to last year. I'm confident our entire team will be energized and ready to support our guests throughout the busiest season of the year.\n So now as I get ready to turn the call over to Michael, I want to quickly thank all of you for your continued interest and engagement with Target. I've been fortunate to meet and interact with many of you over the years beginning with my time as CFO and continuing with my time leading operations. I also want to say to the entire Target team, thank you for everything I've learned from you, for your enduring passion for retail and for your love of this iconic brand. I'll continue to be a huge supporter of this company and this team when I'm no longer on these calls. Because of all of you, I know that the company and our guests are in very good hands, and I'll be cheering on your efforts from the sidelines.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. Before I begin my formal remarks, I want to thank you for the positive impact you've made on this company, our strategy, our team and on me personally. I've been fortunate to work with you and learn from you since I first arrived at Target 20 years ago. \n In the third quarter, total revenue was down 4.2%, reflecting a 4.3% decline in total sales and a 0.6% decline in other revenue. Within the other revenue line, declines in credit card revenue and a few smaller items were nearly offset by growth in Roundel ad revenue. Among the drivers of our third quarter comparable sales, traffic was down 4.1%, combined with a 0.8% decrease in average ticket.\n While we're encouraged that our Q3 comp trend improved 0.5 point compared with Q2 and the traffic trend recovered a little bit faster, we're not at all satisfied with this result, and we're laser-focused on moving both traffic and sales trends back into positive territory. As Christina mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments. So not surprisingly, Q3 comp performance was strongest around the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons. For the remainder of the quarter, we saw variability week by week with periods of relative strength around promotions. \n Our third quarter gross margin rate of 27.4% was more than 2.5 points better than last year, driven by multiple benefits within merchandising, including meaningfully lower freight costs and favorable clearance markdowns. In addition, we benefited from year-over-year favorability in digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. And perhaps, surprisingly, merchandise mix drove a small rate benefit compared with last year as we continue to benefit from growth in higher-margin categories like Beauty and we saw the softest performance in very low-margin categories, like electronics. \n Partially offsetting these tailwinds, the rising cost of inventory shrink represented a 40 basis point headwind to our third quarter gross margin rate. While we're encouraged that this impact was smaller than expected and better than we faced earlier in the year, growth in shrink remains a significant financial headwind, and we're determined to continue making progress in the years ahead. \n While our Q3 guidance anticipated significant improvement in our gross margin rate, our actual performance was well above our expectations as the team delivered greater-than-expected progress on several fronts. At the top of that list is their continued agility in managing inventory, which delivered compelling benefits on both the gross margin and SG&A expense lines. \n In addition, our team's ongoing efforts to identify long-term efficiency opportunities is already contributing to this quarter's better-than-expected performance. Beyond those drivers, a couple of macro factors came in better than expected including freight costs and the impact of inventory shrink.\n On the SG&A line, our third quarter rate of 20.9% was just over 1 percentage point higher than last year. This growth reflected cost increases throughout our business, including continued investments in our team, along with the deleveraging impact of lower sales, partially offset by disciplined cost management throughout the organization. Our Q3 depreciation and amortization expense rate of 2.4% was about 10 basis points higher than a year ago, reflecting dollar growth of about 3%. \n Altogether, our third quarter operating margin rate of 5.2% was more than a percentage point higher than last year. And notably, this year's rate was only about 20 basis points lower than the 5.4% our business delivered prior to the pandemic in the third quarter of 2019 despite the cumulative 110 basis point drag from shrink we faced since then. \n Also important, given the growth in revenue that our team has delivered over that 4-year period, this year's Q3 operating margin dollars were more than 30% higher than in 2019. As a result, on the bottom line, both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 in this year's third quarter were more than 36% ahead of last year and more than 50% higher than in 2019.\n Important to note, while the backdrop today remains tough, because of the long-term investments we continue to make and the efforts of our team to identify efficiency opportunities throughout our business, we have a lot more opportunity to grow both our top line and increase our profitability in the years ahead. And our team is already delivering strong profit performance, both compared to a year ago and versus our longer-term history as well.\n Now I'll turn to capital deployment and reiterate our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained for more than 50 years. And finally, we deploy any excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchase over time. \n Regarding the first priority, capital investment through the first 3 quarters of the year was just under $4 billion, and we expect full year CapEx will be near the high end of the $4 billion to $5 billion range we laid out for the year. While we're still in the early stages of developing next year's capital plan, our current expectation is that next year's CapEx will be somewhat lower than this year in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, reflecting our current view of the optimal timing for key investments we're planning over the next several years. Regarding our second capital priority, we paid dividends of just over $0.5 billion in Q3, $10 million higher than last year, reflecting a per share dividend increase of 1.9%.\n Regarding the last priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our middle A credit ratings. And we continue to make meaningful progress on that journey as the combined benefits of higher profits and lower working capital have led to a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow. More specifically, our operations have generated more than $5.3 billion in cash through the first 3 quarters of the year, up dramatically from about $550 million through the first 3 quarters of 2022. \n As always, I'll conclude my review of the quarter with our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC, which was 13.9% in the third quarter, down from 14.6% a year ago. While an after-tax return in the low teens is quite healthy in absolute terms, it's meaningfully lower than the returns we expect to deliver over time. Importantly, we've seen sequential improvement in this metric over the last couple of quarters, and we're focused on continuing that momentum in the years ahead.\n Now I'll turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On the top line, our expectations reflect our continued near-term caution, leading us to maintain our prior guidance for a mid-single-digit decline in Q4 comparable sales. On the bottom line, we're also maintaining a cautious posture, particularly because the fourth quarter is typically a very promotional season. As such, we're planning a wide range for our fourth quarter EPS of $1.90 to $2.60, which represents approximately flat growth to last year on the low end and growth of about 37% on the high end.\n I also want to note that 2023 is a 53-week year. So the fourth quarter will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and result in about 30 basis points of operating margin rate leverage on the quarter. Note that it will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length.\n On top of the results, our team has already delivered through Q3, our fourth quarter guidance implies a full year EPS range that's very close to the original guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year, with a midpoint less than $0.05 from the center of the original range. That's an amazing outcome against the backdrop of a tougher-than-expected top line, and it's a testament to the tireless efforts of our team to stay nimble and successfully navigate through a volatile and unpredictable period.\n In fact, given how strong our profit rate performance has been so far this year, we've been getting some questions about whether we're only focused on increasing our profit rate, and I want to pause and address that question head on. As John mentioned earlier, coming into this year, we were confident our team would deliver a significant increase in our profit rate by achieving better alignment between our inventory and our sales. In addition, a year ago, we first talked about the significant long-term efficiency opportunities we're pursuing, given that we've grown our revenue to more than $100 billion per year.\n While that work is still in its early stages, the team has already delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of efficiency savings so far this year, significantly benefiting our profitability. But I want to make it clear, we are focused on growing profit dollars. And if we saw an opportunity to invest a portion of our current profit rate to gain sustainable long-term growth in dollars, we would gladly do that. Even more fundamentally, our first priority is to deliver long-term top line growth because the only way a retailer can sustainably deliver bottom line growth is by delivering top line growth as well.\n At the same time, we're not interested in making any investments that might boost the top line in the short term, but which wouldn't lead to any sustainable growth. In fact, our experience has shown that many times, those kinds of short-term decisions are actually harmful over time. \n So today, we remain focused on the long-term strategies that have been so successful in driving top line growth over the last half decade, including our work to enhance our assortment of both owned brands and national brands, our investments in our store assets and our team to deliver a reliable and differentiated shopping experience, investments in new stores and markets we've not previously served and in existing stores to keep them fresh and enhancing our digital experience, beginning with the website and Target app, all the way through to the fulfillment services we provide.\n As we pursue those long-term initiatives, we also have opportunity to further grow our operating margin rate in the years ahead, and we don't believe those efforts are incompatible with each other. But more directly, based on where we are today, we believe we can successfully deliver both top line growth and rate improvement over time.  \n And as always, the basis for my confidence starts and ends with the Target team. They have delivered unprecedented growth over the last several years. And this year, they've made amazing progress in moving our profitability back toward the optimal level, all while focusing on building and maintaining long-term relationships with our guests. Our team is truly the best team in retail.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to pause and acknowledge John's incredible record of service to Target and thank him for his profound impact he's had on this company. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I'm not planning to recap his entire 27-year career this morning. But I do want to highlight the impact he's had since I arrived in 2014, an impact that literally began on my first day when John handed me a large binder, a recap of the comprehensive strategy review he and the Board conducted during his time as interim CEO. \n That body of work was an invaluable resource that allowed me to hit the ground running. It serves as a blueprint for all the strategic changes we made in those early years. One of those changes was the creation of a Chief Operating Officer role, the first time we've had one at Target. And while John was already an outstanding CFO, I knew he was the right person for this new position. Since becoming COO in 2015, and John has led the transformation of our store portfolio from new stores or remodels through the operating model within those buildings.\n Similarly, John is leading the transformation of our upstream supply chain completely changing the way our distribution network serves our stores. And of course, John's team developed and implemented our stores as hub strategy. When we launched stores as hubs, it was a completely unique approach in retail. It's a model that has changed the way we serve our guests, including Drive-Up service, now accounts for well over $7 billion in annual sales, $7 billion is larger than the total sales of some other prominent retailers.\n But beyond the tangible operational changes John has led, it's his focus on team development and its impact on individual leaders that's been the most notable. John has served as both a formal and informal mentor to countless members of our team, and he's hired and developed an extraordinary group of leaders, including Mark Schindele in our stores and Gretchen McCarthy in our supply chain, both of whom are ready and well prepared to continue leading the work after John steps down. \n Perhaps the strongest compliment I can pay John is to say he will be missed as a colleague, and I will personally miss his partnership. But I know our operations will not miss a beat given how masterfully he's prepared everyone around him. And that goes for me, too. Since the day I arrived, John has been a trusted adviser, whose only goal was to do what was best for our guests, for this great company and for our team. \n I should also reiterate that John will remain in his role through the end of this fiscal year and has agreed to continue in advisory role until February of 2025. We'll share additional information on our succession plans for John early next year. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I sincerely thank John for all he's done for Target and wish him only the best in his retirement. \n With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. \nRobert Ohmes: First, I just want to say congrats to Brian and team Target on a great quarter in a really tough environment and to John Mulligan on just everything you've accomplished working at Target. But then my question is actually for Mr. Fiddelke. I was hoping that you could talk to us about how to think about the puts and takes on gross margin differences in, say, 4Q versus 3Q. You mentioned shrink was a little better. How should we think about that for the fourth quarter, also freight versus what you saw in the third quarter? What inventory management could bring in expectations for markdown ranges that we should think about for the fourth quarter, say, versus the third quarter, to give us something to think about. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Happy to start, Robby. And you had a couple of other drivers in your question. The Q3 relative benefits of shrink coming out in a little better than we thought, freight coming in healthy on a year-over-year basis were certainly contributing factors. But the one I just underscore is the continued benefit we see from our strong inventory position. The cautious approach we've taken to inventory and, frankly, the team's good work to drive more productivity with a better inventory position, that inventory position just reaps benefits across our operations. Our stores are more efficient, our DCs are more efficient. All systems run better with inventory where it sits today. And with inventory down 14% on the balance sheet as we exit the quarter, we feel really good about that inventory position heading into Q4. \nRobert Ohmes: And do you still expect shrink to be favorable year-over-year in the fourth quarter? \nMichael Fiddelke: So that's probably worth spending just a second on so that we all interpret what we're likely to see in Q4 the right way. Given the pace of some of our accruals last year, we would expect shrink to not to be quarter-over-quarter headwind in Q4 that we've seen throughout the balance of the year. Important to note that, that doesn't mean we've turned the corner on shrink. We'll continue to watch those trends carefully, and we still saw year-over-year pressure in Q3 as the underlying shrink in the business is still a headwind on a year-over-year basis, but there's some things unique to last year in Q4 that are likely to make it less of a driver of year-over-year variance in that quarter. \nBrian Cornell: Robby, I might build on Michael's comments around inventory. And we certainly feel very good about the actions we've taken and the reduction of inventory by 14%. But if you heard Christina earlier in the call, we've also been leaning into newness and feel really good about our position going into the holiday season with 10,000 new items, and we'll continue to lean in to meet demand during the holiday season. So I think the team has done an exceptional job of managing inventory. The benefits throughout our system have been realized in the third quarter. But we're playing to win in the fourth quarter. And I think Christina highlighted the amount of newness we have in our system and the great value we'll offer our guests throughout the holiday season. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: Congrats on a nice quarter. So just for the holiday season, just curious if there's any early reads you can share and then any commentary just in terms of what you're seeing quarter-to-date. \nBrian Cornell: Well, as you might expect, we're watching it day by day, almost hour by hour, but we're still really early in the season. The big days, the big weeks are still in front of us. So we'll launch it carefully. Again, I think we're prepared for a really solid holiday season, but it's just way too early to tell. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then maybe one follow-up question just on the CapEx. So expectations are lower for next year. Any specific buckets where you guys expect to reduce CapEx spending next year? Just any initial color you can share. \nMichael Fiddelke: You can expect us to unpack that more as we get into the start of next year, Rupesh. But wanted to share our latest thinking of how we think the cadence by year flows, and as you heard me say in my remarks, importantly, we'll continue to invest in the things that will drive growth over time. We're really pleased with the almost $5 billion of investments this year and the returns those will drive. And we feel like that $3 billion to $4 billion number is the right number for next year based on what we see today, but more to come on that front. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Best of luck to John Mulligan. With sales down around 5% in the third quarter and the guidance calling for a similar decline in the fourth quarter, one of the key debates, and using an example is, are customers not coming to Target right now because they're just not in the market for a coffeemaker, as an example? Or are they buying that coffeemaker somewhere else? And if the latter is the [ key ], how much more promotional will Target need to become in order to get the customer back? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, I'm happy to start, and then I'll ask Christina to provide additional color. But one of the things that we've called out a number of times now is that there's tremendous pressure on the consumer's wallet and the impact of very sticky food and beverage inflation, which compared to prepandemic, food and beverage prices were up on average 25%. And that's certainly pressured consumers as they're making choices and certainly has forced them to make very tough choices when it comes to discretionary goods. \n We've actually seen in the industry 7 consecutive quarters where discretionary goods have declined both in dollars and units. So there's an overall pressure in the marketplace. So you're seeing a consumer who is focused on managing their budget, buying those household essentials and then carefully shopping for those new items you just mentioned. \n But Christina, why don't you give Michael some additional color on what we're seeing in some of those categories? \nA. Hennington: Yes. To build on what Brian said, certainly, when we do have hot promotions, the guest is responding. And the fourth quarter is always very competitive, and we'll be very well positioned with everyday low prices as well as promotions and investments in Circle, our loyalty program. I think the big difference for us this year and this fourth quarter is the amount of newness that we've invested in. If there's one thing that we've seen is in an environment where people are making choices and they might have some constraints with their budget, the motivation to buy is really, is this going to add value to my life? Is this something that is intriguing and feels relevant or is fashion forward or is really for me?\n And doing more of the same just isn't going to get it done, which is why we've invested in newness. And you'll see that across the store. You'll see it as you walk in, first thing in our women's set. It's right on trend, it's colorful. The price points are very appealing. You walk around to our seasonal business. Right now, you can get everything [indiscernible], your tree skirt to ornaments at a great value. Continue down the path to toys, you've got over 2/3 of our toys below $25. And then around the corner of our store to food, where you can get not only your Thanksgiving meal for under $25, but all the gifting solutions and special trades for Marks & Spencer, only rounded out at Beauty, which has been our strongest business year-to-date and for many years and find gifting solutions at every price point. \n So we're really pleased with assortment we're putting forward and think this will certainly motivate the guest to buy. \nBrian Cornell: And Michael, one point to clarify. While we've certainly called out the pressure we're seeing both from an industry standpoint and a Target standpoint in discretionary categories, in the third quarter alone, we generated over $25 billion of revenue. And as Michael referenced, on a full year basis, we'll generate over $100 billion of revenue. A significant portion of that comes from discretionary sales. \n And as Christina pointed out, much of that's tied to combining great newness with affordability. And I think we're well positioned to continue to perform in those categories. So while we've seen some pressure, consumers continue to turn to Target for Apparel and Home, for discretionary categories and items. And I think we're well positioned with the amount of newness and value we'll offer during the holiday season. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, Brian, over the last couple of years, Target has shown that it can drive sales growth. It's now showing that it can drive profitability. As you look towards 2024, when arguably the consumer is going to continue to face pressure, will your priority being on driving better sales performance or sustaining the profitability that Target has been able to achieve this year? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, it's such a great question. And you heard me say this in my prepared comments, our focus is on obviously doing both. We're certainly not satisfied today with our top line performance, and we are laser-focused on improving traffic, on growing our top line and continuing to advance our profitability. So for Target, it's a combination of doing both. And as we finish this year and build our plans for 2024, you'll see us being focused on driving our top line, building traffic and continue to expand our profitability. \nOperator: Our next question is from Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. \nEdward Yruma: John Mulligan, congratulations on all that you've done, and thanks for all the help over the years. Really just a couple of clarification questions. So Michael, on shrink, I know last year you had a significant accrual in the fourth quarter, you said that there's favorability, but just trying to understand the underlying trend. Are you seeing stabilization? And not to conflate 2 things, but I know you did call out kind of more usage of full-service lane. So trying to understand if you kind of at least start to flatten the curve on shrink. And then as a follow-up, on discretionary categories, obviously, nice to see the improvement in Apparel. Are you planning kind of continued improvement within that negative mid-single comp guide? \nMichael Fiddelke: I'm happy to start with the shrink question, Ed. In the third quarter, we still saw year-over-year pressure, so about 40 basis points of year-over-year headwind. That's less pressure relatively than we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year, and it was a little better than we thought it'd be. And so those are encouraging signs of some progress in the right direction, but to be clear, still a year-over-year headwind in Q3. And so as we've said before, shrink's a lagging metric. We think progress there probably doesn't happen quickly. But we're focused on progress over time, and you'll see us continue to take the actions to get a better outcome there over time, but it's not one that we'd expect overnight. \nA. Hennington: And on the discretionary side, I said it in my prepared remarks, but there was an underlying shift in the third quarter compared to the second quarter with both Apparel and Home accelerating nicely. And so that's our continued goal, is to make sure that we present the right level of newness to build the business back to positive territory over the long term. We are, however, picking our bets. And so our cautionary planning to inventory has bought so much goodness in the total P&L on the operation that about -- it's about being choiceful and placing our bets. \nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We wonder if you could talk to traffic trends by month throughout the quarter. And just wondered how much better traffic in the third quarter versus second quarter was driven by customers coming back after what we saw in June. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. So when we think about what we see in traffic, as you heard in our prepared remarks, it was good to see sequentially traffic improve quarter-over-quarter at a slightly faster rate than the top line did. And we're excited about the work teams do, that balance of newness and value and the investments we continue to make in the business to turn traffic back in our favor over time. And so that's where you'll see us focused, Kate. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And then our follow-up question is just around promotions. Are you seeing any kind of increase in vendor support when it comes to promotions versus what you saw last year? \nA. Hennington: As we've talked about, the consumer is responding to promotions and so the market is responding accordingly. With that said, I'd say it's still a rational environment. And the healthy inventory position that we're in allows us to continue to offer great value to our guests without chasing empty calories. \nMichael Fiddelke: Kate, I might offer just one more piece of context on traffic. Even with the tougher sales trends that we've seen so far year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of this year versus prepandemic, traffic is up over 20% in total. And so we feel really good about the engagement that we've built with guests over the last few years. We think that's an asset and a base that will really benefit us well going forward. \nKatharine McShane: And John Mulligan, congratulations. \nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: And I wanted to ask, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from unit perspective in terms of unit sales? And I know, as you mentioned in the transcript, that units are down a little bit. But are you starting to see any stabilization there? And how should we think about unit sales going forward? And also if you could touch on the Grocery aspect of that as well, I'd be curious -- or Essentials, I should say. \nA. Hennington: Yes. So Brian hit on this in his prepared remarks, that the industry has seen a slowdown in unit performance over many quarters in a row. And that is because the pressure on the consumer is really real and they're having to make those choices. I also shared in my remarks that in the frequency businesses, which we think of as Food and Beverage and Essentials and Beauty, that in the third quarter we saw prices come down so that we comped over the peak of inflation. The prices came down, that's an industry-wide phenomenon. And as a result, we did see some improvement in unit velocity. That's a good thing in the long run, is that when consumers can stretch their budget across more things that they want to buy and not have it tied up in any high prices. That's a good thing. But as Brian talked about, the inflation on these categories over the last several years, especially in Food, Household Essentials, even pets and baby, is meaningful. And that's going to take a while to overcome. \nBrian Cornell: Operator, we've got time for 2 more questions today. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I want to go back to this market share -- or not market share, actually sales versus margin. And I'm curious if you can speak to market share, if that is a gauge you're looking at how -- what happened during the quarter. And is the decision around this trade-off, is it market share dependent? Are there certain categories you're looking at thinking about when to apply promotions or where to apply promotions? \nA. Hennington: So right now, with total consumer spending soft in the discretionary portfolio, we are not going to chase short-term benefit at the long term -- at the expense of long term. And so it's always a balance. We're always looking to drive both sales and profit. We've also been very clear that this year has -- we put profit on a high priority to recover from last 5 years. But as Brian said, the long-term gain -- the long-term game has to be both. \nBrian Cornell: Again, I'll underscore the point Christina just made. Simeon, I think you know it's all about the balance. And we're always looking to balance our focus on sales and margin and profitability. Early in the year, we talked about the fact that we were going to plan discretionary categories cautiously in this environment. And we said appropriately. And I think that's played out well for us. But at the same time, we've been leaning into categories with strong demand in Food and Beverage, in Household Essentials, in Beauty. \n We know today's consumers still celebrating seasons. So we lean into Back-to-School and Back-to-College and Halloween. And we know they're going to celebrate the holiday season. So we're leaning into those select categories where we know the guest is looking for newness, affordability, and they're going to celebrate those seasons. But that's what we do each and every day as a good retailer and is constantly a balance category by category of the focus on sales, on market share, on profitability. And I think as you saw in the third quarter, that's the way that [ worked ] for us. \nSimeon Gutman: And just quick follow-up, sortation centers. Do you have a sense of what the savings look like? Do you have enough scale and experience with them to know what the savings will be? And is that a '24 -- do we start to see the savings next year? \nBrian Cornell: Well, you've opened up the door for John Mulligan to answer your question today, and I'm really glad you did. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks for that, Simeon. I would start by saying we remain incredibly excited about sort centers. And with that, we have already started to see savings flow through the P&L. We haven't talked about it because I think -- it's been 3 years, but we are still early in the journey. I think there's still much to do in front of us. We're still optimizing routes. We're still just getting into much higher capacity vehicles, which will create more density, which will create more savings. \n And then what we've said over the next few years, we've got at least 5 more of these to open. And then as we get the digital business growing again, hopefully, that number goes up as well. So we're still in the early days, but we remain very optimistic because we are seeing savings. It's much faster than the alternative, and we know the next best alternative, we are operating well below from a cost perspective. \nBrian Cornell: Operator, we've got time for our final question. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Congratulations to John. It's been an incredible journey, and I hope you have a wonderful retirement. So Mike, I'll follow up on the operating margin question for next year. Michael, maybe you could talk about the puts and takes as you think about next year. Clearly, the consumer is the question. But as you think about shrink versus maybe some incremental promotion when you're not so lean on the inventory side versus what you might see from Roundel and you also have the $2 billion to $3 billion cost savings program. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks for the question, Chris. I think the punch line is we'll talk more about next year after we get through a really important holiday season. So that's our team's focus right now. And a lot of what will impact as we get there will be some of the things that you listed in your question. But more to come as we turn the page to next year once we get through a really important fourth quarter. \nBrian Cornell: Yes. Thank you. So operator, that concludes our Q3 call. I want to thank everybody for joining us. I wish everybody a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to seeing you in March.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. Over the last 3.5 years, our operations have continually faced unusual and rapidly changing external conditions. In 2020 and 2021, after the onset of the pandemic, we couldn't secure enough inventory to satisfy the explosion in demand for our products, and we saw operating margin rates grow well beyond normal levels. Then in early 2022, the period of rapid growth in discretionary categories suddenly reversed, and we quickly moved from having too little inventory to having way too much. As a result, both our distribution centers and store backrooms filled up well beyond optimal levels and operating margin rates quickly moved to historical lows.\n So this year, as Brian mentioned, a key priority was to optimize our inventory position so it was better aligned to the current size and growth rate of our business. We were confident that if we were successful in that effort, our operations will become more efficient, markdowns will come back down, and we'd see our profit rate recover back toward more sustainable long-term levels. And through the first 3 quarters of the year, despite unexpectedly soft top line trends, the team has delivered a more rapid recovery in our profitability than we'd even planned at the beginning of the year.\n Looking ahead, we've maintained this cautious inventory posture and planning for the fourth quarter as well. More specifically, at the end of the third quarter, total inventory on our balance sheet was 14% lower than a year ago with discretionary category inventory down 19%. And importantly, while this ending inventory position was 29% higher than at the end of Q3 2019, that's aligned with growth we've seen on the sales line over those 4 years, making us feel really good about both the size and the health of our inventory position as we enter the holiday season.\n In addition, even though we own a lot less inventory than a year ago, the team has delivered meaningfully improved reliability and in-stock metrics this year, and they made additional progress in Q3. More specifically, overall in-stocks in the third quarter improved nearly 1 percentage point compared with Q2 and more than 3 percentage points from a year ago. And notably, in-stocks in our highest volume stores saw an even greater year-over-year improvement. \n In terms of our top-selling items, while the in-stock rate remained consistent between Q2 and Q3, that was after we grew the size of that list by about 75%, meaning that today, our top item list accounts for more than 1/3 of our total sales. Beyond these broader metrics, we also saw meaningful improvements in our seasonal in-stocks and a more than 6 percentage point improvement in new item in-stocks. \n In our smaller stores, which on average have less shelf capacity and turn faster than the chain, in-stocks have improved by more than 2 percentage points between the first and third quarters. And today, our in-stock levels in those stores are slightly better than the overall chain. And finally, in the digital channel, the percent of items available for purchase has improved by more than 2 points compared with last year, reflecting an improvement of nearly 8 percentage points in Apparel.\n Beyond the work of our team to deliver these outstanding improvements, we're benefiting from a more than 2-week reduction of import lead times compared with last year and a nearly 10 percentage point improvement in purchase order fill rates compared with a year ago. And with the combined benefit of a faster supply chain and a simultaneous reduction in inventory levels, all of our supply chain facilities stayed at or below our desired capacity thresholds through all 13 weeks of the third quarter this year compared with only 3 of 13 weeks in Q3 of 2022. So while we'll continue to focus on ways to consistently deliver higher in-stocks and reliability, I'm incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished so far this year. \n So now before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to highlight how our team continues to deliver on their efforts to improve execution of everyday retail fundamentals as we prepare for the busiest shopping season of the year. One of the key areas of focus for our store teams this year was to ensure priority items remained available on our sales floors throughout the day. And this year, through these efforts, we've increased the amount of inventory available on our sales floors by more than $0.25 billion. \n In addition, we've seen improvements in metrics relating to backroom inventory accuracy and the percent of new assortments set on time. In the digital channel, the percentage of orders picked and shipped on time and the average Drive-Up wait time have all improved from last year. Also in support of the digital business, the percent of items ordered but not found has declined from a year ago, meaning that we are fulfilling more items per order and canceling fewer, a key factor in guest satisfaction. \n Since our goal is for Target to be the easiest place for our guests to shop, our teams have been focused on the front of store experience with the goal of providing consistently great service through the in-store checkout experience, along with drive-up and in-store pickup. And because our guests tell us they enjoy interacting with our team, since we've refocused on the front-end experience, we've seen more than a 6 percentage point increase in the usage of full service lanes across the chain. And we've seen sustained month-over-month improvement in the Net Promoter Score relating to interactions with our team at checkout. In addition, compared with last year, we've seen improvements in Net Promoter Scores for both Drive Up and in-store pickup on top of already high levels a year ago.\n Beyond the front of store, in support of our efforts to highlight value and affordability, our team has been working to increase the number of store end caps featuring 1 or 2 price points. As a result, going into this holiday season, nearly 2/3 of our end caps were meeting the standard and conveying a simple, compelling and easy-to-understand value message. \n Finally, I want to provide a quick update on our goal of hiring 100,000 seasonal team members to join our team and provide a great guest experience during the holiday season. I'm happy to report that our hiring stats this year have improved relative to last year. I'm confident our entire team will be energized and ready to support our guests throughout the busiest season of the year.\n So now as I get ready to turn the call over to Michael, I want to quickly thank all of you for your continued interest and engagement with Target. I've been fortunate to meet and interact with many of you over the years beginning with my time as CFO and continuing with my time leading operations. I also want to say to the entire Target team, thank you for everything I've learned from you, for your enduring passion for retail and for your love of this iconic brand. I'll continue to be a huge supporter of this company and this team when I'm no longer on these calls. Because of all of you, I know that the company and our guests are in very good hands, and I'll be cheering on your efforts from the sidelines.\n Now I'll turn the call over to Michael. Thanks for that, Simeon. I would start by saying we remain incredibly excited about sort centers. And with that, we have already started to see savings flow through the P&L. We haven't talked about it because I think -- it's been 3 years, but we are still early in the journey. I think there's still much to do in front of us. We're still optimizing routes. We're still just getting into much higher capacity vehicles, which will create more density, which will create more savings. \n And then what we've said over the next few years, we've got at least 5 more of these to open. And then as we get the digital business growing again, hopefully, that number goes up as well. So we're still in the early days, but we remain very optimistic because we are seeing savings. It's much faster than the alternative, and we know the next best alternative, we are operating well below from a cost perspective."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John. For many years now, we have focused on building a durable business model that allows us to meet guests where they are, developing and enhancing the right tools and capabilities while investing heavily in our team, all in the service of providing an affordable, easy and joyful guest experience. And the flexibility of our multi-category model has served us incredibly well over the last few years, delivering unprecedented growth in both traffic and sales.\n Today, our business generates well over $100 billion in annual revenue and is successfully navigating through a very challenging environment as consumers continue to rebalance their spending between goods and experiences and make tough choices in the face of persistent inflation. Even as our P&L is being impacted by multiple top line and bottom line challenges, including soft industry trends in discretionary categories, moderating inflation rates in Essentials and Food and Beverage and higher inventory shrink. We've seen a meaningful improvement in profitability compared with last year.\n More specifically, our EPS through the first 3 quarters of 2023 was more than 40% higher than last year and more than 26% higher than in 2019. Importantly, even beyond this year's rapid progress, we believe we have a significant opportunity to grow both the top line and bottom line in the years ahead. So even as we remain cautious in our near-term outlook, we're not standing still. We're playing the long game, investing in our stores, our supply chain, our team, our digital capabilities and our assortment to provide the newness, value and convenience our guests want for this holiday season and beyond. At the heart of it all is our focus on being our guests' happy place and delivering the joyful shopping experience that makes Target, Target. \n In the third quarter, Target's comparable sales were down 4.9%, in line with our expectations. Consistent with prior quarters and overall industry trends, discretionary categories were the driver of this decline, partially offset by net sales growth in our frequency categories. Between sales channels, store comp trends were somewhat stronger than in the digital channel. Among our digital fulfillment capabilities, same-day services saw high single-digit comp growth led by Drive-Up, which expanded 12%. Strength in these services was offset by continued softness in brown box delivery, which is most affected by the pullback in discretionary categories. \n On the bottom line, our third quarter EPS of $2.10 was well above our expectations and more than 36% ahead of last year. This increase reflected the continued benefit of lower freight costs, disciplined inventory management by our team, favorable category and channel mix and the continued benefit of our work to enhance efficiency, which offset multiple pressures throughout our business. This is outstanding profit performance in the face of a very challenging environment, and I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts in support of our guests, our business and each other.\n As you know, one of our top priorities this year was to rebuild our profitability following the unique challenges we faced in 2022. And while there's lots more work ahead of us, I'm really pleased with the progress the team has delivered so far this year. At the same time, I want to make it clear. We are not satisfied with the top line trends we've been seeing. Our #1 priority is to get back to sustainable growth in both traffic and sales, and we're committed to investing in long-term initiatives to deliver this growth.\n As we assess the external environment, it's clear that consumers have been remarkably resilient. Yet at the same time, our research indicates that themes like uncertainty, caution, managing my time and budget and focusing on essentials while still finding ways to celebrate are all top of mind. Overall, consumers are still spending, but pressures like higher interest rates, the resumption of student loan repayments, increased credit card debt and reduced savings rates, have left them with less discretionary income, forcing them to make trade-offs in their family budgets.\n For example, this year, we've seen more and more consumers delaying their spending until the last moment. Guests who previously bought sweatshirts or denim in August or September are deciding to wait until the weather turns cold before making a purchase. This is a clear indication of the pressures they're facing as they work to stretch their budgets until the next paycheck. \n Consistent with these pressures, as we look at recent trends across the retail industry, dollar sales are being driven by higher prices with consumers buying fewer units per trip. In fact, overall unit demand across the industry has been down 2% to 4% in recent quarters. And the industry has experienced 7 consecutive quarters of declines in discretionary dollars and units. And while we're happy to see inflation rates moderating this year, if you compare industry pricing in key categories back to 2020, food at home pricing for families has increased 25% overall and in some areas, up to 30%. And if you're a parent raising a baby, you're facing increases of more than 30% on baby food and formula, too. And that's in addition to persistent increases in a variety of other categories.\n So when you layer on the impact of higher energy prices, it all puts pressure on discretionary spending. As a result, this holiday season, we're focusing on highlighting the amazing value we've always provided in our end caps, promotions and the price points we feature in our marketing. As we built our plans for this holiday season, we maintained our cautious inventory positioning in markdown-sensitive categories. This provides our team the necessary flexibility to quickly adjust to volatile trends, something that has served us well all year.\n But I want to be crystal clear. That does not mean we're backing off on newness. While we're cautious about the size of our inventory commitments, we're leaning into the amount of innovation featured in our assortment. And after several years in which our vendors were focused on raising production volumes in the face of unprecedented demand, we're encouraged by the focus on newness and innovation we're seeing from them. And as I've mentioned, throughout this holiday season, we'll be focused on highlighting value, helping families to celebrate the joy of the season in a way that fits their budget.\n Beyond our assortment, as we work to provide a great guest experience, we've enhanced our training of retail fundamentals to our teams. This is an important shift after years of operating in an environment that was anything but normal. After all, given the large number of team members we've hired over the last few years, a meaningful number of them have never experienced ordinary sales trends.\n As we've said many times, investments in our team are the most important ones we make. And today, we remain on our front foot, investing to ensure they can deliver a joyful industry-leading shopping experience. This holiday season, we'll be supplementing our existing team by hiring nearly 100,000 seasonal team members to meet expected demand and ensure we can deliver a joyful shopping experience.\n So now as I get ready to hand the call over to Christina, I think it would be useful to pause and assess how this year has progressed in comparison to our expectations. As a reminder, at the beginning of this year, we said we were expecting a challenging environment with the sales guidance range centered around flat comparable sales. In terms of profitability, we said we expected to grow our full year operating income by $1 billion or more with an expected EPS range of $7.75 to $8.75.\n So today, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, top line trends have obviously been tougher than expected, and we're firmly focused on getting back to growth. But the story on profitability has been very different. Through the first 3 quarters of this year, we've already grown operating income by more than $1 billion compared with last year despite unexpected headwinds from higher-than-expected shrink and softer-than-expected sales. We're encouraged with this performance against a challenging backdrop, which demonstrates the resilience of both our team and our business. I'm incredibly proud to be a member of this great team and excited about the growth we're positioned to deliver in the years ahead. \n Now I'll turn the call over to Christina. Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to pause and acknowledge John's incredible record of service to Target and thank him for his profound impact he's had on this company. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I'm not planning to recap his entire 27-year career this morning. But I do want to highlight the impact he's had since I arrived in 2014, an impact that literally began on my first day when John handed me a large binder, a recap of the comprehensive strategy review he and the Board conducted during his time as interim CEO. \n That body of work was an invaluable resource that allowed me to hit the ground running. It serves as a blueprint for all the strategic changes we made in those early years. One of those changes was the creation of a Chief Operating Officer role, the first time we've had one at Target. And while John was already an outstanding CFO, I knew he was the right person for this new position. Since becoming COO in 2015, and John has led the transformation of our store portfolio from new stores or remodels through the operating model within those buildings.\n Similarly, John is leading the transformation of our upstream supply chain completely changing the way our distribution network serves our stores. And of course, John's team developed and implemented our stores as hub strategy. When we launched stores as hubs, it was a completely unique approach in retail. It's a model that has changed the way we serve our guests, including Drive-Up service, now accounts for well over $7 billion in annual sales, $7 billion is larger than the total sales of some other prominent retailers.\n But beyond the tangible operational changes John has led, it's his focus on team development and its impact on individual leaders that's been the most notable. John has served as both a formal and informal mentor to countless members of our team, and he's hired and developed an extraordinary group of leaders, including Mark Schindele in our stores and Gretchen McCarthy in our supply chain, both of whom are ready and well prepared to continue leading the work after John steps down. \n Perhaps the strongest compliment I can pay John is to say he will be missed as a colleague, and I will personally miss his partnership. But I know our operations will not miss a beat given how masterfully he's prepared everyone around him. And that goes for me, too. Since the day I arrived, John has been a trusted adviser, whose only goal was to do what was best for our guests, for this great company and for our team. \n I should also reiterate that John will remain in his role through the end of this fiscal year and has agreed to continue in advisory role until February of 2025. We'll share additional information on our succession plans for John early next year. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I sincerely thank John for all he's done for Target and wish him only the best in his retirement. \n With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Robby, I might build on Michael's comments around inventory. And we certainly feel very good about the actions we've taken and the reduction of inventory by 14%. But if you heard Christina earlier in the call, we've also been leaning into newness and feel really good about our position going into the holiday season with 10,000 new items, and we'll continue to lean in to meet demand during the holiday season. So I think the team has done an exceptional job of managing inventory. The benefits throughout our system have been realized in the third quarter. But we're playing to win in the fourth quarter. And I think Christina highlighted the amount of newness we have in our system and the great value we'll offer our guests throughout the holiday season. Well, as you might expect, we're watching it day by day, almost hour by hour, but we're still really early in the season. The big days, the big weeks are still in front of us. So we'll launch it carefully. Again, I think we're prepared for a really solid holiday season, but it's just way too early to tell. Michael, I'm happy to start, and then I'll ask Christina to provide additional color. But one of the things that we've called out a number of times now is that there's tremendous pressure on the consumer's wallet and the impact of very sticky food and beverage inflation, which compared to prepandemic, food and beverage prices were up on average 25%. And that's certainly pressured consumers as they're making choices and certainly has forced them to make very tough choices when it comes to discretionary goods. \n We've actually seen in the industry 7 consecutive quarters where discretionary goods have declined both in dollars and units. So there's an overall pressure in the marketplace. So you're seeing a consumer who is focused on managing their budget, buying those household essentials and then carefully shopping for those new items you just mentioned. \n But Christina, why don't you give Michael some additional color on what we're seeing in some of those categories? And Michael, one point to clarify. While we've certainly called out the pressure we're seeing both from an industry standpoint and a Target standpoint in discretionary categories, in the third quarter alone, we generated over $25 billion of revenue. And as Michael referenced, on a full year basis, we'll generate over $100 billion of revenue. A significant portion of that comes from discretionary sales. \n And as Christina pointed out, much of that's tied to combining great newness with affordability. And I think we're well positioned to continue to perform in those categories. So while we've seen some pressure, consumers continue to turn to Target for Apparel and Home, for discretionary categories and items. And I think we're well positioned with the amount of newness and value we'll offer during the holiday season. Michael, it's such a great question. And you heard me say this in my prepared comments, our focus is on obviously doing both. We're certainly not satisfied today with our top line performance, and we are laser-focused on improving traffic, on growing our top line and continuing to advance our profitability. So for Target, it's a combination of doing both. And as we finish this year and build our plans for 2024, you'll see us being focused on driving our top line, building traffic and continue to expand our profitability. Operator, we've got time for 2 more questions today. Again, I'll underscore the point Christina just made. Simeon, I think you know it's all about the balance. And we're always looking to balance our focus on sales and margin and profitability. Early in the year, we talked about the fact that we were going to plan discretionary categories cautiously in this environment. And we said appropriately. And I think that's played out well for us. But at the same time, we've been leaning into categories with strong demand in Food and Beverage, in Household Essentials, in Beauty. \n We know today's consumers still celebrating seasons. So we lean into Back-to-School and Back-to-College and Halloween. And we know they're going to celebrate the holiday season. So we're leaning into those select categories where we know the guest is looking for newness, affordability, and they're going to celebrate those seasons. But that's what we do each and every day as a good retailer and is constantly a balance category by category of the focus on sales, on market share, on profitability. And I think as you saw in the third quarter, that's the way that [ worked ] for us. Well, you've opened up the door for John Mulligan to answer your question today, and I'm really glad you did. Operator, we've got time for our final question. Yes. Thank you. So operator, that concludes our Q3 call. I want to thank everybody for joining us. I wish everybody a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to seeing you in March."

            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we've shared for the past several quarters now, even as our guests face tough choices as they manage their budgets, they're also continuing to celebrate seasonal moments while showing their excitement for new product offerings and compelling value. After all, consumers are feeling the weight of multiple economic pressures and discretionary retail has borne the brunt of this weight for many quarters now.\n In addition, consumers are facing newly emerging headwinds, including higher interest rates and the return of student loan payments. In the face of this mental and emotional tug of war, consumers are looking for a respite, which is why we are relentless in our pursuit to provide ease, inspiration, joy and comprehensive value every day. And while we are not satisfied with our current performance, I'm confident that our team's empathy and their continued focus on serving our guests' wants and needs, will pay dividends in the years ahead.\n As Brian mentioned, our third quarter comparable sales decline reflected continued softness in discretionary categories, partially offset by growth in Beauty. Notably, comps within frequency categories slowed between Q2 and Q3, driven entirely by a deceleration in the comp benefit from growth in average retail. More specifically, in both Food and Beverage and Beauty and Essentials, the benefit from average pricing decelerated by about 3 percentage points between the second and third quarters as we move beyond the period of peak inflation from a year ago. As we've said, a lower inflation rate is welcome news as it will reduce pressure on consumer budgets, making room for them to expand back into discretionary categories over time. \n Beauty-led performance in the quarter with comparable sales growth in the high single digits driven by strength across core Beauty and our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings. We're excited to launch Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in the third quarter, and it has quickly become one of our top-selling beauty brands across the chain. In Food and Beverage, comp sales were down slightly to last year. Seasonal candy, snacks and hosting solutions performed particularly well. Comp sales in Essentials declined in the low single digits despite strength in health care and baby categories. \n Comp sales in our discretionary categories remained soft in the third quarter with declines ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. However, trends improved markedly compared with the second quarter, thanks to the agility of our team and their focus on listening and responding to our guests. Home saw a high single-digit comp decline, an improvement of more than 6 percentage points from the second quarter. Most notably, we saw strength in Back-to-School and college categories and a great response to our assortment of Stanley drinkware. \n Additionally, within kitchenware, we launched our most recent owned brand, Figmint, and received an enthusiastic response from our guests. Figmint offers more than 250 items, ranging from enameled cookware to ceramic mixing bowls to kitchen gadgets all at a quality, aesthetic and value that can't be topped.\n Apparel comparable sales also declined high single digits, an improvement of nearly 3 percentage points when compared with Q2. The business was strongest within new offerings, including our partnership with Kendra Scott jewelry, the latest All In Motion performance wear and new fall fashion sets within our women's categories. Hardlines comparable sales were down in the low teens. While we were encouraged by Back-to-School performance, demand for electronics remains particularly soft.\n This quarter's performance demonstrates that while the results are not immune to macro conditions, when we focus on retail fundamentals, offer exciting new products at incredible value and respond to our guests' wants and needs in a timely manner, we remain relevant with our guests, even against the challenging backdrop. By leaning into seasonal moments like Back-to-School, Back-to-College and Halloween, we not only drove sales in the current quarter, we helped to build lasting affinity with our guests. This focus on celebrating the season creates an engaging experience that keeps Target top of mind.\n And that's why we continue to offer events like our latest Target Circle week in early October, which added another 500,000 members to our loyalty platform, providing future opportunities to engage with these guests in deeper ways. Our goal this holiday season is to create the perfect combination of incredible value, inspiring and fresh products and a joyful shopping experience as you stroll the aisles in our stores or on the recently refreshed Target website and app.\n We aim to deepen the relationships with our guests as they look to deck the halls and celebrate the joys that the holidays bring. As we do year round, we are leaning into the power of and this holiday season by not focusing only on one aspect of our strategy, but celebrating how they all work together to create a unique offering in a crowded retail landscape.\n Our plans start with a celebratory experience that you feel the moment you walk into our stores or open the Target website or app, featuring on-trend and inspiring color pallets, imagery and in-store marketing that complements all the excitement and joy, we are creating with our national marketing campaigns. Guests will feel the holiday spirit before they even add their first item to the cart. The excitement builds with our assortment at unbeatable value only at Target-exclusive merchandise and our easy and convenient holiday solutions. \n And through it all, we'll remain diligent on executing the necessary retail fundamentals our guests want and expect from us, including being in-stock on the must-have items of the season, offering unmatched value and pricing, highlighting our inspiring and differentiated merchandise assortment and making each trip easy and convenient regardless of where, when and how guests chooses to shop. \n Whether a guest knows exactly what they're looking for or needs a bit of inspiration, we want to make the trip joyful, easy and welcoming. And we know families want to celebrate the holidays, but they're relying on us to help them do so affordably. With a combination of everyday low prices, compelling promotions and exciting savings events all season long, we aim to be the holiday destination for affordable joy.\n So with Thanksgiving right around the corner, guest shopping for food and beverage area will discover how we're helping families celebrate with a Thanksgiving meal that includes all the family favorites for under $25, featuring $0.99 per pound Good & Gather turkeys and the must-have sides for just $5. As they explore our assortment, guests will discover exciting gifting options for every loved one.\n In toys, guests will find the characters and items their kids want at prices designed to fit every budget, with over 2/3 of this season's toy assortment priced under $25. In addition, around 1 in 4 toy items is a Target exclusive, featuring everyone's favorite properties, including Barbie, Paw Patrol, Pokemon, Marvel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, LEGO and so much more. And so far, among the most popular toys in our assortment are All Things Target, including plush Bullseye dogs, Barbie First Job at Target Dolls and Target cash register and shopping cart toys, a nod to the Target brand love, even among our youngest guests.\n And back by popular demand, we have an exciting array of toys from FAO Schwarz, including only-at-Target exclusives with 50% of the assortment under $20. With so many options to choose from, we are making it easier than ever to help narrow in on what will bring the biggest smiles this holiday season through exciting in-store displays and experiences. And on target.com as well as the Target app, guests can immerse themselves in a digital 360-degree room filled with the hottest toys for kids of all ages to try before they buy.\n When the presents are taken care of, it will be time to deck the halls, and we're offering an array of holiday decor at even lower prices than ever before. Nearly 2/3 of the assortment will be priced under $20 with in-store and digital signing and displays, making it easy for guests to see how they can refresh their holiday decor affordably with $15 ornament sets, family baking solutions and Mondo Llama craft sets, $10 throw pillows and tree skirts and still much more.\n And of course, the season is all about gathering with loved ones. Guests will find all the best entertaining, gifting and gathering solutions in this year's assortment, and we're launching more than 100 new items in Good & Gather and Favorite Day, with over half of these priced under $5.\n Throughout the holiday season, guests can rest assured that they'll get the best price and quality, wherever and however they shop. We'll be offering incredible deals leading up to Black Friday, including 4 weeks of deals on tens of thousands of items with many up to 50% off. Target Circle members will receive exclusive promotions and offers to reward and deepen their love of All Things Target. Plus, we've added more personalization than ever before, giving them even more options to earn rewards. And of course, we'll offer our season-long price match guarantee, which assures guests that no matter when they shop, they'll get the best price of the season.\n The holidays are so special to so many families, and they are made even brighter by everything our team members do for our guests and for each other. I'm so inspired by how each of our teams from marketing to merchandising to stores to supply chain are bringing their best to create something truly magical and uniquely target this holiday season. I want to thank the entire Target team around the world for being the not-so-secret weapon that will help us to win the holiday season. \n As I get ready to end my remarks, John, I want to pause and thank you and acknowledge your countless contributions to the Target brand and team. I've greatly appreciated getting to work alongside you for so many years and know your legacy will be felt for many more. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to you. Yes. To build on what Brian said, certainly, when we do have hot promotions, the guest is responding. And the fourth quarter is always very competitive, and we'll be very well positioned with everyday low prices as well as promotions and investments in Circle, our loyalty program. I think the big difference for us this year and this fourth quarter is the amount of newness that we've invested in. If there's one thing that we've seen is in an environment where people are making choices and they might have some constraints with their budget, the motivation to buy is really, is this going to add value to my life? Is this something that is intriguing and feels relevant or is fashion forward or is really for me?\n And doing more of the same just isn't going to get it done, which is why we've invested in newness. And you'll see that across the store. You'll see it as you walk in, first thing in our women's set. It's right on trend, it's colorful. The price points are very appealing. You walk around to our seasonal business. Right now, you can get everything [indiscernible], your tree skirt to ornaments at a great value. Continue down the path to toys, you've got over 2/3 of our toys below $25. And then around the corner of our store to food, where you can get not only your Thanksgiving meal for under $25, but all the gifting solutions and special trades for Marks & Spencer, only rounded out at Beauty, which has been our strongest business year-to-date and for many years and find gifting solutions at every price point. \n So we're really pleased with assortment we're putting forward and think this will certainly motivate the guest to buy. And on the discretionary side, I said it in my prepared remarks, but there was an underlying shift in the third quarter compared to the second quarter with both Apparel and Home accelerating nicely. And so that's our continued goal, is to make sure that we present the right level of newness to build the business back to positive territory over the long term. We are, however, picking our bets. And so our cautionary planning to inventory has bought so much goodness in the total P&L on the operation that about -- it's about being choiceful and placing our bets. As we've talked about, the consumer is responding to promotions and so the market is responding accordingly. With that said, I'd say it's still a rational environment. And the healthy inventory position that we're in allows us to continue to offer great value to our guests without chasing empty calories. Yes. So Brian hit on this in his prepared remarks, that the industry has seen a slowdown in unit performance over many quarters in a row. And that is because the pressure on the consumer is really real and they're having to make those choices. I also shared in my remarks that in the frequency businesses, which we think of as Food and Beverage and Essentials and Beauty, that in the third quarter we saw prices come down so that we comped over the peak of inflation. The prices came down, that's an industry-wide phenomenon. And as a result, we did see some improvement in unit velocity. That's a good thing in the long run, is that when consumers can stretch their budget across more things that they want to buy and not have it tied up in any high prices. That's a good thing. But as Brian talked about, the inflation on these categories over the last several years, especially in Food, Household Essentials, even pets and baby, is meaningful. And that's going to take a while to overcome. So right now, with total consumer spending soft in the discretionary portfolio, we are not going to chase short-term benefit at the long term -- at the expense of long term. And so it's always a balance. We're always looking to drive both sales and profit. We've also been very clear that this year has -- we put profit on a high priority to recover from last 5 years. But as Brian said, the long-term gain -- the long-term game has to be both."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Before I begin my formal remarks, I want to thank you for the positive impact you've made on this company, our strategy, our team and on me personally. I've been fortunate to work with you and learn from you since I first arrived at Target 20 years ago. \n In the third quarter, total revenue was down 4.2%, reflecting a 4.3% decline in total sales and a 0.6% decline in other revenue. Within the other revenue line, declines in credit card revenue and a few smaller items were nearly offset by growth in Roundel ad revenue. Among the drivers of our third quarter comparable sales, traffic was down 4.1%, combined with a 0.8% decrease in average ticket.\n While we're encouraged that our Q3 comp trend improved 0.5 point compared with Q2 and the traffic trend recovered a little bit faster, we're not at all satisfied with this result, and we're laser-focused on moving both traffic and sales trends back into positive territory. As Christina mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments. So not surprisingly, Q3 comp performance was strongest around the Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons. For the remainder of the quarter, we saw variability week by week with periods of relative strength around promotions. \n Our third quarter gross margin rate of 27.4% was more than 2.5 points better than last year, driven by multiple benefits within merchandising, including meaningfully lower freight costs and favorable clearance markdowns. In addition, we benefited from year-over-year favorability in digital fulfillment and supply chain costs. And perhaps, surprisingly, merchandise mix drove a small rate benefit compared with last year as we continue to benefit from growth in higher-margin categories like Beauty and we saw the softest performance in very low-margin categories, like electronics. \n Partially offsetting these tailwinds, the rising cost of inventory shrink represented a 40 basis point headwind to our third quarter gross margin rate. While we're encouraged that this impact was smaller than expected and better than we faced earlier in the year, growth in shrink remains a significant financial headwind, and we're determined to continue making progress in the years ahead. \n While our Q3 guidance anticipated significant improvement in our gross margin rate, our actual performance was well above our expectations as the team delivered greater-than-expected progress on several fronts. At the top of that list is their continued agility in managing inventory, which delivered compelling benefits on both the gross margin and SG&A expense lines. \n In addition, our team's ongoing efforts to identify long-term efficiency opportunities is already contributing to this quarter's better-than-expected performance. Beyond those drivers, a couple of macro factors came in better than expected including freight costs and the impact of inventory shrink.\n On the SG&A line, our third quarter rate of 20.9% was just over 1 percentage point higher than last year. This growth reflected cost increases throughout our business, including continued investments in our team, along with the deleveraging impact of lower sales, partially offset by disciplined cost management throughout the organization. Our Q3 depreciation and amortization expense rate of 2.4% was about 10 basis points higher than a year ago, reflecting dollar growth of about 3%. \n Altogether, our third quarter operating margin rate of 5.2% was more than a percentage point higher than last year. And notably, this year's rate was only about 20 basis points lower than the 5.4% our business delivered prior to the pandemic in the third quarter of 2019 despite the cumulative 110 basis point drag from shrink we faced since then. \n Also important, given the growth in revenue that our team has delivered over that 4-year period, this year's Q3 operating margin dollars were more than 30% higher than in 2019. As a result, on the bottom line, both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 in this year's third quarter were more than 36% ahead of last year and more than 50% higher than in 2019.\n Important to note, while the backdrop today remains tough, because of the long-term investments we continue to make and the efforts of our team to identify efficiency opportunities throughout our business, we have a lot more opportunity to grow both our top line and increase our profitability in the years ahead. And our team is already delivering strong profit performance, both compared to a year ago and versus our longer-term history as well.\n Now I'll turn to capital deployment and reiterate our priorities, which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained for more than 50 years. And finally, we deploy any excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchase over time. \n Regarding the first priority, capital investment through the first 3 quarters of the year was just under $4 billion, and we expect full year CapEx will be near the high end of the $4 billion to $5 billion range we laid out for the year. While we're still in the early stages of developing next year's capital plan, our current expectation is that next year's CapEx will be somewhat lower than this year in the $3 billion to $4 billion range, reflecting our current view of the optimal timing for key investments we're planning over the next several years. Regarding our second capital priority, we paid dividends of just over $0.5 billion in Q3, $10 million higher than last year, reflecting a per share dividend increase of 1.9%.\n Regarding the last priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third quarter as we continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and restoring our debt metrics to levels that support our middle A credit ratings. And we continue to make meaningful progress on that journey as the combined benefits of higher profits and lower working capital have led to a meaningful improvement in operating cash flow. More specifically, our operations have generated more than $5.3 billion in cash through the first 3 quarters of the year, up dramatically from about $550 million through the first 3 quarters of 2022. \n As always, I'll conclude my review of the quarter with our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC, which was 13.9% in the third quarter, down from 14.6% a year ago. While an after-tax return in the low teens is quite healthy in absolute terms, it's meaningfully lower than the returns we expect to deliver over time. Importantly, we've seen sequential improvement in this metric over the last couple of quarters, and we're focused on continuing that momentum in the years ahead.\n Now I'll turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. On the top line, our expectations reflect our continued near-term caution, leading us to maintain our prior guidance for a mid-single-digit decline in Q4 comparable sales. On the bottom line, we're also maintaining a cautious posture, particularly because the fourth quarter is typically a very promotional season. As such, we're planning a wide range for our fourth quarter EPS of $1.90 to $2.60, which represents approximately flat growth to last year on the low end and growth of about 37% on the high end.\n I also want to note that 2023 is a 53-week year. So the fourth quarter will include an extra week of sales and profits. We estimate that extra week will add about $1.7 billion in sales and result in about 30 basis points of operating margin rate leverage on the quarter. Note that it will not affect our comparable sales as we base that calculation on periods of equal length.\n On top of the results, our team has already delivered through Q3, our fourth quarter guidance implies a full year EPS range that's very close to the original guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year, with a midpoint less than $0.05 from the center of the original range. That's an amazing outcome against the backdrop of a tougher-than-expected top line, and it's a testament to the tireless efforts of our team to stay nimble and successfully navigate through a volatile and unpredictable period.\n In fact, given how strong our profit rate performance has been so far this year, we've been getting some questions about whether we're only focused on increasing our profit rate, and I want to pause and address that question head on. As John mentioned earlier, coming into this year, we were confident our team would deliver a significant increase in our profit rate by achieving better alignment between our inventory and our sales. In addition, a year ago, we first talked about the significant long-term efficiency opportunities we're pursuing, given that we've grown our revenue to more than $100 billion per year.\n While that work is still in its early stages, the team has already delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of efficiency savings so far this year, significantly benefiting our profitability. But I want to make it clear, we are focused on growing profit dollars. And if we saw an opportunity to invest a portion of our current profit rate to gain sustainable long-term growth in dollars, we would gladly do that. Even more fundamentally, our first priority is to deliver long-term top line growth because the only way a retailer can sustainably deliver bottom line growth is by delivering top line growth as well.\n At the same time, we're not interested in making any investments that might boost the top line in the short term, but which wouldn't lead to any sustainable growth. In fact, our experience has shown that many times, those kinds of short-term decisions are actually harmful over time. \n So today, we remain focused on the long-term strategies that have been so successful in driving top line growth over the last half decade, including our work to enhance our assortment of both owned brands and national brands, our investments in our store assets and our team to deliver a reliable and differentiated shopping experience, investments in new stores and markets we've not previously served and in existing stores to keep them fresh and enhancing our digital experience, beginning with the website and Target app, all the way through to the fulfillment services we provide.\n As we pursue those long-term initiatives, we also have opportunity to further grow our operating margin rate in the years ahead, and we don't believe those efforts are incompatible with each other. But more directly, based on where we are today, we believe we can successfully deliver both top line growth and rate improvement over time.  \n And as always, the basis for my confidence starts and ends with the Target team. They have delivered unprecedented growth over the last several years. And this year, they've made amazing progress in moving our profitability back toward the optimal level, all while focusing on building and maintaining long-term relationships with our guests. Our team is truly the best team in retail.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Yes. Happy to start, Robby. And you had a couple of other drivers in your question. The Q3 relative benefits of shrink coming out in a little better than we thought, freight coming in healthy on a year-over-year basis were certainly contributing factors. But the one I just underscore is the continued benefit we see from our strong inventory position. The cautious approach we've taken to inventory and, frankly, the team's good work to drive more productivity with a better inventory position, that inventory position just reaps benefits across our operations. Our stores are more efficient, our DCs are more efficient. All systems run better with inventory where it sits today. And with inventory down 14% on the balance sheet as we exit the quarter, we feel really good about that inventory position heading into Q4. So that's probably worth spending just a second on so that we all interpret what we're likely to see in Q4 the right way. Given the pace of some of our accruals last year, we would expect shrink to not to be quarter-over-quarter headwind in Q4 that we've seen throughout the balance of the year. Important to note that, that doesn't mean we've turned the corner on shrink. We'll continue to watch those trends carefully, and we still saw year-over-year pressure in Q3 as the underlying shrink in the business is still a headwind on a year-over-year basis, but there's some things unique to last year in Q4 that are likely to make it less of a driver of year-over-year variance in that quarter. You can expect us to unpack that more as we get into the start of next year, Rupesh. But wanted to share our latest thinking of how we think the cadence by year flows, and as you heard me say in my remarks, importantly, we'll continue to invest in the things that will drive growth over time. We're really pleased with the almost $5 billion of investments this year and the returns those will drive. And we feel like that $3 billion to $4 billion number is the right number for next year based on what we see today, but more to come on that front. I'm happy to start with the shrink question, Ed. In the third quarter, we still saw year-over-year pressure, so about 40 basis points of year-over-year headwind. That's less pressure relatively than we saw in the first 2 quarters of the year, and it was a little better than we thought it'd be. And so those are encouraging signs of some progress in the right direction, but to be clear, still a year-over-year headwind in Q3. And so as we've said before, shrink's a lagging metric. We think progress there probably doesn't happen quickly. But we're focused on progress over time, and you'll see us continue to take the actions to get a better outcome there over time, but it's not one that we'd expect overnight. Yes. So when we think about what we see in traffic, as you heard in our prepared remarks, it was good to see sequentially traffic improve quarter-over-quarter at a slightly faster rate than the top line did. And we're excited about the work teams do, that balance of newness and value and the investments we continue to make in the business to turn traffic back in our favor over time. And so that's where you'll see us focused, Kate. Kate, I might offer just one more piece of context on traffic. Even with the tougher sales trends that we've seen so far year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of this year versus prepandemic, traffic is up over 20% in total. And so we feel really good about the engagement that we've built with guests over the last few years. We think that's an asset and a base that will really benefit us well going forward. Thanks for the question, Chris. I think the punch line is we'll talk more about next year after we get through a really important holiday season. So that's our team's focus right now. And a lot of what will impact as we get there will be some of the things that you listed in your question. But more to come as we turn the page to next year once we get through a really important fourth quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 17, 2023.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Financial Officer. In a few minutes, Brian, Christina, John and Michael will provide their perspective on our first quarter performance, along with our outlook and priorities for the second quarter and beyond. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.\n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's press release and our most recently filed 10-K. Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the first quarter and his priorities for the second quarter and remainder of the year. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our team's discipline and dedication to staying in step with our guests, drove results that met or exceeded the expectations we set at our financial community meeting back in February. Q1 total sales increased 0.5%, reflecting flat comparable sales at the midpoint of our guidance range, combined with the benefit of sales in new locations.\n Profitability for the quarter was ahead of expectations. We came into the year clear-eyed about what consumers are facing with persistent inflation and rising interest rates. And we were determined to build on the trust our guests have had in target by unifying as a team to deliver affordable joy each and every day as consumers and businesses navigate, a third straight year of dynamic challenges. We knew this year would demand agility and teamwork and the ability to flex across our multi-category portfolio as we emphasize the categories our guests need most now. Well, our team did all of that in Q1, taking other step forward on our long-term growth trajectory. I might point to 3 unbroken years of traffic growth as a proof point.\n In the first quarter, comparable traffic grew 0.9%, even as consumers were becoming more cautious in their overall shopping behavior. That's a healthy indication of the trust, loyalty and strategic relevance we've created, especially given how much and how frequently consumers and the world circumstances have changed over those 12 straight quarters of traffic growth. Very few others can point to anything like that. This growth in guest engagement is the product of deliberate investments we've been making for many years. In all we do, we put the guests at the center, listening carefully to them and finding innovative ways to make their lives easier, more convenient and more joyful. \n And here again, both the balance of our multi-category portfolio and the flexibility of our stores as hub model are helping us stay in step with our guests. The mix of in-store shopping has been growing for well over a year now as consumers have become increasingly comfortable in public places. This has led them to choose more in-store visits causing in-store sales growth to outpace digital in the first quarter, both this year and a year ago.\n Notably, even within the digital channel, our same-day services, which rely entirely on our stores expanded more than 5% during the quarter. As usual, this increase was led by our Drive-Up service. We saw growth in the high single digits as more and more of our guests embrace the speed, convenience and reliability it provides. In total for the quarter, more than 97% of our sales were fulfilled by our stores.\n As it did throughout last year, pressure from inflation and rising interest rates affected the mix of retail spending in Q1, with a further softening in discretionary categories in the March and April time frame. This coincided with the deterioration in consumer confidence, reflecting recent events such as the banking crisis that emerged in March. These continued signs of caution among consumers have reinforced why we entered this year with a conservative inventory position. \n And as Michael will cover in more detail, we maintain that cautious stance throughout the first quarter and feel good about our current positioning in light of the trends we've been seeing. But as Christina will highlight in a few minutes, our cautious posture has not reduced our commitment to offering fresh, on-trend merchandise throughout the year. We know that newness is a critical element of what our guests expect when they shop with us. And even if they manage their household budgets and make disciplined buying choices, our guests continue to respond when we offer the right combination of newness, trend right fashion and affordability. That's what we mean when we talk about affordable joy. It's something that's core to our brand and a key differentiator in the marketplace.\n Beyond macroeconomic challenges, we continue to contend with significant headwinds caused by inventory shrink, building on a worsening trend that emerged last year. While shrink can be driven by multiple factors, theft and organized retail crime are increasingly urgent issues, impacting the team and our guests and other retailers. The problem affects all of us, limiting product availability, creating a less convenient shopping experience and putting our team and guests in harm's way. The unfortunate fact is violent incidents are increasing at our stores and across the entire retail industry. And when products are stolen, simply put, they're no longer available for our guests who depend on them and left unchecked, theft and organized retail crime to grade the communities we call home.\n As we work to address the problem, the safety of our guests and our team members will always be our primary concern. As a result, we are engaged in a variety of mitigation efforts, which began with significant resource investments to protect our team and our guests. In addition, we're installing pictures to protect merchandise and adjusting our assortment in affected stores.\n Beyond safety concerns, worsening shrink rates are putting significant pressure on our financial results. More specifically, based on the results we've seen so far this year, we expect that shrink will reduce our profitability by more than $0.5 billion compared with last year. And while we're doing all we can to address the problem, it's an industry and community issue that can't be solved by a single retailer. That's why we're actively collaborating with legislators, law enforcement and retail industry partners to advocate for public policy solutions to combat organized retail crime. As we communicate with those partners, we emphasize that we're focused on keeping our stores open in the markets where problems are occurring.\n Our stores create jobs, serve local shoppers and act as critical hubs in communities across the country and we'll continue to do everything in our power to keep our doors open. At the same time, we'll be closely monitoring the safety of our team and guests as well as the financial impact to our business as we determine the right path forward at Target.\n Even as we navigate through multiple short-term challenges, we remain focused on making Target stronger and better for all our stakeholders over the long term. Right now, our team is rallying around of focus on retail fundamentals to ensure we're staying reliable and affordable for our guests and that we're translating key points of difference like our physical proximity to the vast majority of U.S. shoppers and our emphasis on a joyful guest experience into unmatched ease and inspiration for our guests as we continue to grow and scale.\n We're also intently focused on creating easier and more efficient ways for our team to deliver on our strategy and fuel our ongoing growth ambitions.\n Underpinning all of this is our continued commitment to disciplined, return-based investments that will benefit stakeholders both today and well into the future.\n This goes well beyond our physical capital. As John will outline, we'll continue to make important investments in our team. This begins, of course, by building on the robust investments in wages and benefits we've made in recent years. Because of those past investments, today, we offer starting a wage range of $15 to $24 across the country. We significantly enhanced the health and wellness benefits we provide and tens of thousands of our team members are enrolled in our industry-leading debt-free college educational program. But our efforts extend well beyond the wages we pay and the benefits we offer. We are committed to building a culture of growth, providing our team with strong foundational learning, enhancing their skills and providing them to excel not just at their current role, but their next role on the Target team. as they continue to build a rewarding career with us.\n I want to close my remarks by thanking our team. Nothing is more energizing than the time I spend with them, from visits to our stores and distribution centers across the country to the time I recently spent with our headquarter team in Bangalore, India. Our team is proud to work at Target, and they show that pride through their actions every day, all in support of our guests. I'm proud to work alongside them, and it's a privilege to represent their efforts in venues like these.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In many ways, the themes of the first quarter operating environment were very similar to what we've outlined in recent quarters. So it likely comes as no surprise that we continue to face elevated volatility and see a reprioritization of spending away from discretionary categories in the face of persistent inflation in groceries and essentials. Despite the near-term challenges facing the retail industry and our business, we remain confident in our ability to generate long-term results, largely driven by the unwavering commitment displayed by the Target team, to our guests, each other and the communities where we operate. Guests continue to place their trust in Target, choosing to shop with us more and more often, at a time when consumers are hyper-focused on managing their budget.\n As Brian mentioned, American consumers continue to face difficult trade-off decisions as they juggle the wants and needs of their families. Consumer saving rates are down, and while inflation rates are finally declining, so is consumer confidence. The fear of a looming recession weighs heavily on many American families and though discretionary spending remains soft, our guests are still looking to sprinkle some affordable joy into their regular shopping at Target.\n In the first quarter, comparable sales were flat to last year, which was squarely at the center of our expectations. As you heard from Brian, we continue to benefit from traffic and sales growth in our frequency categories; Food & Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty, which helped to offset softer year-on-year sales in our more discretionary home, apparel and hardlines categories. Within the quarter, total sales were strongest in February, began decelerating in March and softened further near the end of April.\n Q1 performance was led by Beauty, which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens in light of continued strength in both Core Beauty and Ulta Beauty at Target assortment. Food & Beverage grew in the high single digits, reflecting broad-based strength across the category. Household Essentials delivered low single-digit growth, reflecting notable strength in both the health and pet care categories. Apparel, home and hard lines all experienced sales declines from the mid-single digits to low double digits as guests continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. Notably, guests are shifting to shop more just in time in these categories as they wait until the last moment before key events to invest in new decor or wardrobe refreshes.\n As we've been noting for some time, despite overall softness in discretionary categories, seasonal moments and newness in apparel, home and hard lines continue to be bright spots, prompting great responses from our guests. Within the first quarter, we had strong Valentine season and Easter holiday across multiple assortments, ranging from food and hosting solutions to decor and giftables. New offerings in apparel, including the latest wave of our designer dress collection and new sets in women's athleisure have seen incredible responses from guests. And this year's major theatrical releases such as Super Mario Brothers and the upcoming Disney film, The Little Mermaid, are driving outsized share gains and sales momentum. These examples demonstrate that when our assortments are fresh, seasonally relevant and affordable, that's a winning formula to engage and delight our guests.\n Given that consumers are cautious when buying discretionary items, we are being more declarative than ever about affordable joy and leaning into value messaging across all our media channels, in-store signing, merchandise displays and through our digital platforms. With a balance of strong opening price points, timely and relevant promotions, as well as a mix of competitively priced national brands and high-quality and affordable owned brand offerings, we have an opportunity to boldly demonstrate the power of Target's value proposition to our guests.\n As I've shared in prior calls, this is where the power of Roundel and Target Circle really shine through, creating collective value for our guests and for Target.\n With consumers more price conscious and focused on promotions right now, we know they're willing to search for a deal, but appreciate when we make the hunt easy for them. By utilizing our rich guest insights, we are best able to match the right product to the right guests with the right promotion. This is why we take such a differentiated approach with Roundel, thoughtfully and selectively connecting vendors and their products to our guests. Roundel's interconnection with the broader Target digital ecosystem means we are uniquely positioned to inspire the millions of users of our website, the Target app and other diverse media platforms. This helps vendors find consumers that are most likely to be interested in our products, creates awareness and conversion to new products for our guests through compelling deals and ads and drives top line and bottom line benefit to Target, all with an eye to enhancing the guest experience.\n Similarly, we know this personalized touch is why active Target Circle users make 2.5x the trips in Q1 compared to non-Circle guests and spent 3x more. Whether through everyday offers or member exclusive events like Target Circle week in March, we see incredible guest response to Target Circle promotions. Roundel and Target Circle provide opportunities for us to connect with guests in both the short and long term, offering instantly gratifying promotions in the now and a tailored and elevated experience that builds lasting affinity tomorrow and beyond. And beyond promotions and product placements, we know that when guests try our own brand offerings, they love the value and quality they receive, and this leads to repeat purchases. \n We also know that simplified, easy to understand, pricing promotion removes friction from the shopping experience, both in stores and online. This explains why our guests are responding to affordable home decor selections where we are expanding our assortment of items priced under $10. It's why we recently launched new swim assortments starting at just $12 and to help our guests get ready for summer celebrations of all kinds are only a Target Sun Squad brand, offers everything needed to be outside this summer with more than 60% of the entire assortment priced under $10 and nearly 90% of the assortment priced under $20. \n But our comprehensive view of affordability extends beyond compelling price points. In particular, our own brand portfolio offers an unmatched combination of quality and price. For an example, look no further than our $3 billion owned brand, Cat & Jack, featuring on-trend durable and affordable kids clothing. With everyday essentials like $4 T-shirts, $5 leggings, and $8 dresses and jeans, Cat & Jack offers both affordability and style. And because we stand behind not just the price but the quality of these items as well, we guarantee all Cat & Jack apparel for 1 full year with free returns should anything not meet our guest expectations. This is just another example of how we offer comprehensive value for our guests giving them affordable options without skipping on quality.\n As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we will continue the steady drumbeat of newness and value all while maintaining a cautious inventory ownership position in our discretionary categories.\n In terms of seasonal moments and holidays, Target teams are focused on helping our guests celebrate all summer long. Starting last weekend, we kicked things off by celebrating Mother's Day with affordable and inspiring ways to thank the moms in our lives, and we have plans to continue celebrating key summer moments [indiscernible] long wrapping up with everything needed to host the perfect Fourth of July Barbecue.\n With new summer Food & Beverage offerings, including more than 100 new Good & Gather items to target exclusive pickup offsets for amateurs and pros alike, we are listening closely to our guests and providing the hottest trends across our entire assortment.\n In apparel, guests will find vibrant color pallets across our offerings, helping all families celebrate summer and style. Best of all, these apparel items provide amazing value with clear, compelling opening price points.  \n For kids and kids at heart, the summer's roster of exciting movie blockbusters will find their way into multiple assortments ranging from apparel to toys to collectibles, featuring familiar characters from Disney, Marvel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and more. And because you can never have too much of a good thing, the latest assortment drop from Tabitha Brown just launched a few days ago. Already off to a fabulous start. This collection celebrates the joy that comes from gathering alongside friends and family, recharging in the summer sun and pausing for fun and games. The assortment includes over 60 items ranging from backyard entertaining essentials, games, tableware, outdoor furniture as well as guest favorite food items backed by popular demand. \n As we navigate this challenging environment, we will continue to lean into flexibility and focus on retail fundamentals while remaining vigilant in monitoring changing trends with the consumer and the economy. It's only because of our incredible team that we are able to stay nimble, listening for and quickly applying guest feedback into our operations. So our teams in stores, supply chain and headquarters locations around the world. Thank you for sharing your talent and passion and support of our guests. You are truly the best team in retail, and you bring Target's values to life each and every day.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. \nJohn Mulligan: Thanks, Christina. Through all of the rapid and unexpected changes we've experienced over the last 3 years, teams throughout our operations have done an amazing job, maintaining their energy, staying agile and doing everything in their power to serve our guests' ever-changing needs. And today, with 2 years of unusually rapid growth behind us and last year's excess inventory in the rearview mirror, we are focusing this year on training and development for our team with an emphasis firmly centered on retail fundamentals. Our goal is to reinforce the reliability and consistency of our shopping experience as we help our team members to succeed in their current job and build the right skills to prepare for the next one. \n More specifically, every store this year is engaging in assessments to reinforce consistently strong execution throughout the country and every day of the year. These assessments are centered on the factors most essential to operating great stores and delivering a consistent experience, ranging from staffing and scheduling to inventory management, in-store signing, digital fulfillment, guest and team member safety and the checkout experience.\n In support of these efforts, we're investing in training and development across every level of our team from entry-level team members to the store leaders. Beyond the reinforcement of everyday best practices, we're preparing our team to support new services including the upcoming rollout of Drive-Up returns and the opening of additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations. In addition, to develop our store supervisors and leaders, we're investing in a cohort-based peer learning model, in which participants engage in classroom experiences, one-on-one coaching and on the job practice. All of this training is designed to help our teams succeed today and build our pipeline of future leaders.  \n Of course, a foundational element of our team development effort is our education assistance program called Dream 2B, which enables our U.S.-based part-time and full-time team members to pursue tuition-free undergraduate and associate degrees, certificates and boot camps. This industry-leading program features tuition-free options in more than 250 business aligned programs across more than 40 schools, colleges and universities. Since the rollout of Dream to Be in 2021, tens of thousands of our team members have successfully participated in this program. \n As you saw in today's release, we ended the first quarter with a 16% less inventory than a year ago. This decrease reflects our current cautious position in discretionary categories, combined with the impact of excess inventory on last year's balance sheet. Those factors are being partially offset by some purposeful inventory investments. These include investments in support of our frequency categories, in light of the rapid growth we've been seeing and to ensure we're in stock. And I'm happy to say that these investments have been paying off.\n In the first quarter, out of stocks of our most important Food & Beverage and Essentials items, we're running at 3-year lows and trending in a favorable direction. In addition to support of our frequency businesses, we're also making strategic inventory investments where we believe we have a long-term market share opportunity, most notably in the upcoming Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons. As you know, in our supply chain, we're engaged in a multiyear journey to modernize how we replenish inventory in our stores.\n When I moved into this position 8 years ago, store inventory replenishment was a standardized inflexible process. That placed a heavy burden on our store team members. With this modernization effort, our primary goal is to reduce those labor demands on our stores. We achieved that result by moving work upstream to a distribution center, where we can apply the appropriate processes, technology, tools and automation to accomplish the work at scale. This results in higher labor efficiency for the company overall while allowing our store team members to spend more time in the front of our stores with our guests.\n In the upstream distribution centers we've opened over the last 2 years, we've implemented technology and capabilities that improve how product is sorted and loaded on to trailers headed for our stores. These improvements reduce the necessary time for the store team to unload the trailer and for them to move the inventory to where it's needed in the store. In these new buildings, we've also invested to automate the sortation and packing of break pack items, facilitating the shipment of quantities smaller than a full case pack. This automated process makes the shipment easier to unload, reduces sorting time for the store team and lowers the amount of inventory in our store backrooms. \n Outside of our new facilities, we're working to roll out similar capabilities to our legacy distribution centers. In addition, throughout our legacy network, we continue to focus on reducing the overall cost of store replenishment by implementing automation, along with other improvements. For example, we've been testing ways to improve the lead time and accuracy of our deliveries from several of our existing buildings and have seen an increase in speed and lower out-of-stocks in stores service from these facilities.\n But I want to stress, automation is only 1 way to deliver value to our business. Consider our sortation centers, which are positioned downstream from our stores to provide speed and efficiency in support of last mile delivery. Our sort centers are not highly automated. Instead, they use technology and sophisticated process logic to sort packages and provide a faster and better guest experience at a significantly lower cost. In fact, it's because of the relative simplicity in the design of these buildings and the efforts of an incredibly innovative and energetic team that we've been able to scale the number of these buildings so quickly from 3 a year ago to 9 today. And an expected total of 15 or more in 2026. \n Beyond rapidly scaling the number of sort centers, our team continues to innovate around the existing processes in those buildings, finding ways to deliver additional value to the business. One example is a new facility that we opened earlier this month in Smyrna, Georgia. This new facility, which costs very little to open, serves as an extension of the existing sortation center in the Atlanta market extending the reach of our next-day delivery capability.\n With this new facility, online orders that have been packed by Atlanta area stores continue to flow to the sortation center, where they're sorted and delivered via our national carrier partners or a ship driver. However, a portion of local orders falling outside the sortation centers last mile delivery area can now be transferred to Smyrna extension, where ship drivers can pick them up and serve additional neighborhoods. \n With the opening of this extension facility, our next-day delivery capability is now reaching more than 3 million guests in the Atlanta market. As we mentioned at our recent financial community meeting in our Dallas and Minneapolis sortation centers, Target and Shipt have been testing the development of high-capacity van routes that enable us to bring last-mile delivery to a larger number of guests. In addition, over the past year, across all of our markets served by our sortation centers, we have shifted more routes to larger passenger vehicles and early results have been positive. \n Compared with routes previously served by sedans, SUVs and minivans can deliver more than double the number of packages per route while high-capacity vans can service nearly 5x as many packages. And beyond capacity, the use of larger vehicles enables further route optimization, increasing the number of packages that can be delivered per hour.\n With these changes, in the first quarter, approximately 65% of our last mile deliveries serviced by Shipt were made with larger vehicles compared with 0 a year ago. This resulted in meaningful cost savings for our last mile delivery program overall. Based on the success of these efforts, we're developing plans to begin testing high-capacity vans at a larger scale. In addition, we're developing a standardized faster way to load those vans, enabling package containerization and easy identification of the correct packages at delivery.\n In addition to simplifying the load process for the drivers, this new process will enable us to safely move a larger number of ship drivers in and out of our sort centers in a given amount of time, expanding our last mile delivery capacity in these markets. While there are many different ways our team is working to gain efficiencies and deliver value to the business, all of our projects have some things in common. First and foremost, they're all designed and implemented with a focus on our guests and continuing to build their engagement with Target. \n In keeping with that guest focus, we design processes and deploy technology and automation as a way to highlight the human element in our business rather than minimizing it. It's an essential element of our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. As I get ready to close, I want to pause and thank our team for bringing that purpose to life every day for both our guests and for your fellow team members. Here are the reason that guests trust and love our brand and why they choose to shop at Target.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, John. In many ways, the environment today feels completely different than 3 years ago when the pandemic was just beginning and no one knew what to expect, but today even as the pandemic feels further and further behind us, we continue to face elevated macro uncertainty and volatility as the world continues to transition toward a new normal. From a macro perspective, inflation remains high and stubbornly persistent, having recently peaked at decades high levels. To control this inflation, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates at an unprecedented pace. But for now, despite the building economic pressure from both inflation and higher interest rates, the U.S. unemployment rate is lower today than it's been in 50 years. And as Christina mentioned, consumer spending patterns continue to evolve, putting significant pressure on our discretionary categories.\n While I'm guessing we're all looking forward to the day when economic conditions begin to stabilize and normalize, I'm pleased that today, even in the face of all these challenges, we're continuing to see deeper engagement from our guests. That's most visible on our traffic, which grew just under 1% in Q1 and has now grown for 12 consecutive quarters. In fact, since 2019, prior to the pandemic, first quarter total sales have increased more than 43%. The vast majority of that growth is the result of an increase in sales per square foot over that time of which a significant portion has been driven by traffic. \n Total sales grew 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting flat comparable sales, combined with the contribution from new locations. Total revenue growth of 0.6% reflected sales growth, combined with double-digit growth on the other revenue line, led by our Roundel ad business. As Brian mentioned, sales trends softened over the course of the first quarter. More specifically, we began the quarter with positive comp growth in the month of February and then saw the trends soften into low single-digit declines by the end of April and so far into May. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate of 26.3% was about 60 basis points higher than a year ago. Among the drivers, we saw more than a percentage point of favorability in merchandising, driven primarily by a reduction in freight and transportation costs, along with the benefit of retail pricing and a lower clearance markdown rate as we compared over last year's inventory actions. We also saw a small gross margin rate benefit from lower digital volume and a more favorable mix of lower cost same-day fulfillment.\n Offsetting those 2 sources of benefit, shrink reduced our gross margin rate by a full percentage point compared with a year ago. As Brian highlighted, pressure from shrink has continued to increase, and we now expect that if current trends continue, shrink will reduce our full year profitability by more than $500 million compared with last year. One note, the impact of merchandise mix on our first quarter gross margin rate was approximately neutral as the rate impact of sales declines in our highest-margin categories was offset by sales declines in lower-margin rate categories.\n Consistent with the guidance we provided for the quarter, our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 19.8%, up about 90 basis points from a year ago. This increase reflects our continued purposeful investments and paying benefits for our team, combined with inflationary cost pressures throughout our business against a backdrop of flat comparable sales, partially offset by the benefit of productivity increases and strong expense discipline across the company. Our first quarter D&A expense rate was down about 10 basis points, reflecting lower accelerated depreciation related to our remodel program compared with last year. Altogether, our first quarter operating income rate to 5.2% was higher than expected, due primarily to upside in our gross margin rate as the benefits from lower freight and transportation costs and our efficiency efforts offset a higher-than-expected impact from shrink.\n As John mentioned, Q1 ending inventory was about 16% lower than a year ago. Within that inventory number was a decline of more than 25% in discretionary categories, reflecting the excess inventory we were carrying last year and the cautious approach we are taking this year. Partially offsetting the decline in discretionary inventory are the purposeful inventory investments we're making in our frequency categories, along with some strategic bets in support of long-term share opportunities. We believe our cautious inventory approach has served us well so far this year and will continue to be the right approach going forward.\n As I turn now to capital deployment, I'll start where I always do, by reiterating our long-standing priorities. First, we fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and look to build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained since 1971. And third, only after we've supported those first 2 priorities, we deploy any excess cash to repurchase shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we made capital investments of $1.6 billion in the first quarter as we continue to remodel stores, open up new locations, build upstream inventory replenishment capacity and ramp up our sortation center strategy. \n With 1 quarter of the year behind us, we continue to expect our full year CapEx will be in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $497 million in the first quarter, up from $424 million last year, driven by a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in average share count.\n And finally, given the impact of the current environment on our financial performance, we didn't repurchase any shares in the first quarter. In the near term, we'll maintain that approach and don't intend to resume repurchase activity until it's compatible with our long-term credit rating goals. \n On that note, I'm pleased with our progress in strengthening our balance sheet. Even as profitability remains well below our long-term potential, we've already seen an encouraging improvement in our operating cash flows. More specifically, our operations generated $1.3 billion of cash in Q1 in stark comparison to a year ago when our operations absorbed $1.4 billion. This dramatic year-over-year improvement was driven almost entirely by changes in our inventory investment compared with last year.\n And finally, I want to end my review of the quarter with our after-tax returned on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months through the first quarter of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 11.4% compared with 25.3% a year ago, reflecting both the change in profitability and the increase in working capital we began to see a year ago. As we move further into the year, we expect to see higher profitability than a year ago and continue to benefit from the inventory efficiency reflected in this quarter's cash flow. Based on these expectations, we anticipate a recovery in the ROIC metric this year and expect to continue building back toward our longer-term potential in 2024 and beyond.\n So now let me turn to our expectations for Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, on the sales line, we experienced notably softer comp trends as we exited the first quarter and moved into May. As a result, we're anticipating second quarter sales in a wide range centered around a low single-digit decline, consistent with those recent trends. In terms of profitability, we're expecting a range of possibilities as well.\n On the gross margin line, we believe that many of the same trends that emerged in Q1 will continue in the second quarter, including a meaningful tailwind from freight and transportation costs, and a significant headwind resulting from inventory shrink. Similarly, on the SG&A expense line, we'll continue to face broad-based inflationary pressures and expect to benefit from efficiency efforts and cost discipline across our team. However, if our second quarter comp sales end up declining in the low single digits, which is where they are trending currently, we'll see greater SG&A rate pressure related to cost deleverage than we experienced in Q1. \n In light of all of these expectations, we believe our Q2 operating margin rate will be much higher than the very low rate we earned a year ago, but lower than the 5.2% we saw in Q1. Altogether, our expectations translate to a second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS range of $1.30 to $1.70.  As we look beyond Q2, we continue to believe that we entered this year with the appropriate level of caution planning conservatively in light of a tough macro environment and rapidly changing consumer trends. While we're facing some clear headwinds in the short term, we also have multiple actions underway to mitigate them, including ongoing efficiency work and cost saving efforts that we expect to flow into the P&L in the second half of the year.\n While we feel good about these efforts, we also remain cautious on the overall environment in light of the macro industry pressures we've outlined today.  Taking this all into account, we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided at our Financial Community Meeting in February. Namely, we're planning for full year comparable sales in a wide range centered around flat. We expect to grow our full year operating income by $1 billion or more, and we expect our business to generate full year GAAP and adjusted EPS of $7.75 to $8.75.\n As I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to reiterate my confidence in our longer-term prospects for profitable growth. Even today against a very challenging backdrop, we're starting to assemble the building blocks for a recovery in our operating margin rate back towards its longer-term potential. And while spending pressures in discretionary categories are currently outweighing the continued strong growth we've seen in our frequency categories, we're confident that the economy and the consumer will stabilize over time and will once again benefit from growth in the more discretionary portion of our assortment.\n In the meantime, we have the capacity to navigate this environment with a strong balance sheet and a resilient business model. We have the right long-term strategy, and we're privileged to work with the best team in retail. I want to express my sincere thanks to our entire team. You are, by far, our most valuable long-term asset.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: As Michael just mentioned, we don't build our strategy based on a single moment, but focus on the best way to serve our guests over time. We take that approach when we invest in our stores, in our supply chain, in digital fulfillment and our team. And as we've said many times, we also build our assortment to serve the long-term needs of our guests and the benefit of this flexible assortment strategy has been clearly evident over the last few years. Following the onset of the pandemic, we saw unprecedented traffic and sales growth in our discretionary categories. \n And now this year, even as guests are pulling back on discretionary purchases, we still grew traffic just under 1% in the first quarter as guests increase their spending in Beauty, Food & Beverage and Household Essentials. But a short-term pullback in discretionary purchases doesn't mean we'll turn away from our apparel, home and hardline categories. Instead, we'll continue to invest in them and deliver fresh new items throughout the year. That's because our guests continue to love these categories, and we're focused on building our guest engagement with them. \n Think about it this way. When I arrived at Target just under 9 years ago, our Food & Beverage category was underperforming and losing market share. But rather than turning away from that part of our business, we decided to lean in. We committed to the long term and engage in the hard work that we needed to improve our performance, ranging from our relationship with vendors to our French food supply chain, store labor model, assortment strategy and our own brands. Much of that work happened behind the scenes, and it took time before business trends in Food & Beverage started to change, but the work paid off over time. We entered 2023 following 3 straight years of unprecedented growth and market share gains in Food & Beverage, having grown that category by more than 61% between Q1 2019 and this year's first quarter. \n Beauty is another category where past investments are paying off. It's been performing well for years because we continually invested in the store experience, in passionate, talented and well-trained team members, in our digital experience and our assortment. Our growing partnership with Ulta Beauty is the latest example of how we're finding innovative ways to further enhance our beauty assortment and experience. And our business results clearly demonstrate that our investments are paying off. \n We've experienced double-digit growth in Beauty sales for the last 3 years in a row and just saw mid-teen growth in the first quarter. These examples demonstrate why we're investing and maintaining our long-term focus across the board on every 1 of our merchandising categories, fulfillment options, stores, services and our team, all in service to bringing affordable joy to our guests.\n If we do that right, we'll always be ready to serve our guests as their needs change, further deepening our long-term relationship with them.\n With that, we'll move to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. \nEdward Kelly: I wanted to start with the guidance. I mean, clearly, you're beginning to see increased consumer pressure now in Q2. And I think those signs of weakening are broad out there. But the midpoint of your guidance implies a pretty good back half improvement. I'm just kind of curious how you thought about Q2 with the reaffirmation of the full year? And is it realistic for us to think that the back half would be in the low $2 range, given what Q2 guidance is? \nBrian Cornell: I'll let Michael start by talking about Q2, and then I'll talk about our focus on the balance of the year. \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, thanks for the question. You said part of the answer right in your question. We continue to take a cautious approach to the top line. We think that served us really well in the first quarter. 1 of the reasons we got the profit outcome we did in the first quarter is that with inventory position conservatively, that gives us flexibility and agility. And so you'll continue to see us take that posture for the balance of the year. And that comes with an impact on the top line and the bottom line. Our leverage looks different at a slightly negative comp than it does when we're running a positive comp. \n A couple of other things that I dimensionalize kind of in how they'll paginate over the year, though. When the shrink with the current trends continuing, that year-over-year pressure from shrink is certainly front half loaded in the year. And so you see that impact in Q2 as well. And then we're excited about the continued work on our efficiency initiatives, and you'll see some of that come to bear in the back half of the year, too. So taking that all together, we feel good about the full year positioning, and we're appropriately cautious for the second quarter. \nBrian Cornell: You heard Christina talk about the changes we've taken from an inventory standpoint, the benefits that it's going to provide over the balance of the year, that gives us optimism as we think about the full year guidance. The combination of reduced inventory allows us to bring newness into our assortment, make sure we're on trend with the items we know our guests are shopping for, continue to leverage the traffic gains we've seen now for 12 consecutive quarters and balance the strength we're seeing in Food & Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty with the seasonal moments where Target shines. So as we sit here today, we're excited about Back-to-School and Back-to-College. We've got great plans for the holiday season. And Christina and her team have done a fabulous job of making sure we've got new on-trend items that are going to delight our guests and provide that affordable joy we're looking for each and every day. \nEdward Kelly: Just a follow-up. At the Investor Day, you mentioned that 6% is, I guess, potential for '24. And the backdrop is shifting though. Can you just sort of update us on your thoughts around that building blocks considering the macro? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, nothing new to share on that front today. I mean, as we sit here 1 quarter into the year with a comp that played out kind of exactly as we expected and a full year guidance that we think is still appropriate. I think we're -- the underlying work in front of us to build back profitability, a meaningful piece of which is part of our plan here in 2023. It will be the first step along that path. \nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So a follow-up to the first question there. So on the comp side, is it your expectation that despite disinflation in consumables that clean inventory, some new newness and easier compares, you're expecting general merchandise performance to, I guess, maybe get less worse as we get into the back half of the year? \nA. Hennington: Chris, maybe I can start this one. We acknowledge that there's a lot of volatility and that we cannot predict the future, but our expectation is that some of the strengths of Target really amplified during the back half of the year. And it starts with what Brian said, Back-to-School, Back-to-College, where the full value proposition of Target is really put on display. You can leverage all 5 categories in our multi-category portfolio to achieve what you need for your families, buying backpacks and lunches and new outfits for school. And that really then sets up into a cadence of the fall with -- we start new fashion trends in September. We go into October with Halloween, followed by Thanksgiving and Christmas, and those are big moments for Target. \n On top of that, we do believe that there's some market share upside in key categories, especially in home, where we believe Back-to-College will benefit strongly from market disruptions in categories like domestic and kitchen appliances. So we're betting on some of those things as well as the newness and the agility that both Michael and Brian have spoken to that having the right fresh assortment and continuing to lead into the affordable side of that will give us momentum in the back half. \nMichael Fiddelke: Chris, the only thing that I might add to that is, that's all underpinned by a clean inventory position. I mean 1 of the benefits of planning inventory cautiously as we've got the flexibility to lean in to all the good stuff Christina just talked about. And so the end of the quarter, down 16% on a year-over-year basis, that's over 25% in the discretionary categories gives us a lot of room to maneuver as we get into the back part of the year. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Then as a follow-up, just thinking about the puts and takes as you move through in the back half of the year on the margin, particularly on the gross margin front. So it sounds like the shrink kind of wait and it sort of dissipates as you hopefully catch up on an accrual here. Does freight also improve? And then as you think about the benefit of freight rise into the back half? And then as you think about the efficiency efforts, can you talk about how they're proceeding and where you expect those efficiency efforts to play out in the P&L? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. You're hitting on some of the 3 key big factors as we get into the back part of the year. We're pleased to see headwind on a year-over-year basis. From freight, we're in a better place now than we were a year ago certainly on that front, and that will continue as we get into the back part of the year based on how we currently have things projected.\n On the efficiency side of things, I mean, there's a lot within that. Some of that will come to bear this year. As we've shared before, importantly, some of that will come to bear over the next few years. But as an example of something that we'll see more benefit from in the back half of this year, sortation centers are a perfect example. We've got many more facilities open this year. They'll do a lot of business in the back half of the year. And so that's -- it's more sort centers helping deliver goods faster in a sort center market and save us some last mile shipping costs with our Shipt and drivers delivering those brown boxes. And so that's 1 of many initiatives that will start to bear fruit as we get into the back part of this year and the years to come. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: One of the key debates right now on Target is what's the sustainable gross margin rate moving forward? And the first quarter performance is going to help inform the various perspectives on that. So with that being said, can you help bridge the gap in your first quarter 2023 gross margin performance versus 2020 -- excuse me, 2019? I know you said that 100 basis points of the gross margin decline versus last year was shrink. I think you previously said that heading back to last year, there was a 150 basis point drag. So is it right to think that the -- more than 2/3 of the decline from this quarter to 2019 was just shrink related? \nMichael Fiddelke: So I'll take a swing at that, Michael. The -- as I said in my remarks, the big drivers, speaking on a year-over-year basis of margin in the first quarter, we had a tailwind from freight. We already talked a little bit about the benefit we're seeing there on a year-over-year basis versus 2019, freight is still a headwind, to be clear. But on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing some benefit. We also saw some benefit on a year-over-year basis on the markdown and think salvage front as we recover from some of the inventory actions that we started to take last year. And then we saw the headwind from shrink, a full percentage point in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Like I said, if the current trends were to continue, we'd see that drag from shrink to be front half of the year loaded and kind of how it shows up throughout the year. But you're hitting on the key -- 3 key drivers on a year-over-year basis. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. And my follow-up question is, the other area of discussion is going to be how do you get this flattish comp for the full year in light of what proceeds to be deteriorating macro situation. So perhaps you're going to make some purposeful choices trading off some margin in order to drive traffic? And if that's the case, how much are you willing to sacrifice the profitability in order to maintain the top line performance as we move into the second half of the year and beyond? \nMichael Fiddelke: I'm happy to start. Christina, feel free to chime in. We think about it a little differently than that, Michael, in that as we think about the last back half of the year, I mean, we're going to drive traffic in a lot of ways, but it's not a simple trade margin for traffic play. It's about being relevant for our guests in the moments that matter. And is evidenced by the strength in traffic we saw in Q1. With the balance we have across categories, we can appeal to whatever is at the top of the guest shopping list. And first and foremost, that's how we think about staying relevant and driving traffic. So our guide for the year unchanged at the end of Q1 versus what we said 90 days ago, incorporates our best view of how we see all of those puts and takes playing out. And it's a wide range on the top line and the bottom line, but we believe is appropriate from the variables as we digest them sitting 1 quarter into the year. Christina, feel free to -- is there anything you'd add? \nA. Hennington: Yes. I agree with Michael, 100% that we aren't looking to make those 2 trade-offs. What we do instead is we look at where is there potential for us to take share because our unique proposition in the market might play really well under these circumstances. But in the discretionary categories, we're going in with a very conservative posture. And so it's the strength of our multi-category portfolio and the guests choosing Food, Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty that's creating the majority of the traffic gains that we're seeing right now. \n And I'm very confident about what that means in terms of what the guests are saying in the categories where there's the most price inflation and the most price sensitivity. They're choosing us disproportionately often, which I think is a very good sign of the relevance that we created. Now we will lean into newness, we will lean into affordable joy. We will lean into areas where the guests also are telling us that they're finding our value proposition to be relevant. That showed up in the first quarter in key seasonal moments and is why I'm excited about the back half because we have more of them and there's more disruption in key categories like home. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, the only other thing I would add is as we think about leveraging our multi-category portfolio in this environment, we have the advantage of a nice balance between national brands and the continued strength we see in own brands, particularly at a time when our guests are looking for that affordable joy from Target. So we do think we're uniquely positioned to continue to maneuver through a challenging 2023 through the strength of our multi-category portfolio, the great national brand partnerships we have, complemented by our own brands and the flexibility we built into our system by reducing inventory and giving us the ability to flow fresh new items that are trend right for our guests. \nOperator: Our next question is from Karen Short with Credit Suisse. \nKaren Short: I just wanted to ask a little bit about your -- you had a lot of discussion in terms of price points that are going to be lower in discretionary. So I guess my question is, how much of there -- how much of your weakness in discretionary is just a misperception on your actual price point and your value proposition? That's my first question. \n And then my second question is when you obviously have more of an extreme issue on shrink than some other retailers, how much are you losing sales based on some of the measures that you're taking? \nBrian Cornell: Karen, why don't I start and address the last point because as we sit here today, we think about what's happening from a theft and organized retail crime standpoint. It's an urgent issue, not just for Target, but across the entire retail industry. It is a problem that impacts availability of product, the shopping conditions are less convenient. And unfortunately, what I'm most concerned with is it puts our team and our guests in harm's way. So we are working right now with NRF, our partners at [indiscernible], other retailers across the country to make sure that we can talk to legislators that we can work with law enforcement to make some industry-wide changes and we're advocating for public policy changes to address the growing issues that surround all of us in retail today with theft and organized retail crime. \n Christina, if we talk about our approach to discretionary categories, I think we've been very clear about the fact that we've been trying to bring fresh new items and at a great price point and value that our guests are looking for. And Karen, I think that's been really consistent throughout the last couple of years as we've seen an overall decline in apparel sales in the industry, in home and hardline-related categories. But Christina can talk to the fact, in many cases, we're holding or growing share in categories that have been soft. But where we've continued to see strength in our ability to hold share and bring newness that's relevant to the guest. \nA. Hennington: Yes, that's absolutely right. We have been talking about unit share for many, many, many quarters in a row because in many cases, we didn't actually raise our prices as much as the market. And we maintained that affordability. And so that has continued to help contribute the traffic gains that we've seen and the performance that we've seen in aggregate. Our value proposition is always a balance between expect more and pay less, and we're always going to play up that. And so the opportunity for us is to make sure that we are cutting through in our -- with the clarity of our promotions that we continue to put those great items in front of the guests and our merchandise displays and that our website reflects the incredible value that we do offer. \n I would tell you though that something that we're leaning into that has the potential to continue to create relevance for our guests is Target Circle. Target Circle is our loyalty program. It's free, and it offers personalized promotions and it is -- we've seen that, that is generating better returns than mass promotions. And so our ability to not only create relevance for our guests, but deliver better returns for the business is a big priority for us. And that is part of the ecosystem the way we deliver value. The last part that I'd offer up, though, is because of the way we deliver value and our value proposition is about balance, it comes through a lot in the assortment and own brands play a particular role here. Not only are they great quality products that have been designed with specific guest needs in mind, they're also incredibly accessible from a price point perspective. And that's why you hear us talking a lot about that, particularly in this environment. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: I just want to get your perspective in terms of what you're seeing right now in the promotional backdrop. And then for Q2, just curious if you guys have assumed a more promotional backdrop in Q2? \nA. Hennington: Right now, there's no question that guests are seeking deals. The opportunity to balance their budget by finding deals is very visible. As I just talked about, the way that we're continuing to evolve our proposition is make sure that the deals that we do offer are certainly competitive with the market, but that they're increasingly more personalized. And as has been said a couple of times now, the inventory position that we're in right now gives us the ability to compete with the market but not chase the market down. And so that's what we're really excited about. We have an agile playbook that will allow us to continue to go after creating relevance for our guests and offering value but keep it rational. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then my follow-up question, just on the shrink, I think per estimates, I think shrink is now $1 billion-plus headwind over a 2-year basis. Does your team feel that you can fully recover that headwind over time? And then with some of the efforts that you already have in place, are you starting to see traction with any of those efforts, even if they're maybe in the early stages? \nBrian Cornell: John, why don't you talk about some of the mitigation efforts we put in place? \nJohn Mulligan: Yes, I think -- as we think about mitigation efforts, I would go back to, first, what Brian said, it starts, first and foremost, with creating a safe environment for our team and for our guests. And there are multiple approaches to that, that also have a financial impact. So clearly, there is what we do with merchandise and how we display it and how we make that available to a guest. There is assortment changes that we can make to improve that performance as well.\n And then finally, there's security changes in the store that we can make. You put all 3 of those together and as you said, we introduced some of those last year. And over time, we do see the impact of that. We see improvement in the safeness of the store. We see improvement in sales and we see a reduction in out-of-stocks, all of which to us are positive indicators that we can make progress. And we'll continue to implement those. Now some of those create additional friction for our guests. It's on us to create the right environment with our team so that we reduce that friction as much as possible. But we do see, overall, again, through time, we see those things improve. \nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Brian, and it's been said a few times, the consumer is becoming more cautious. Can you talk about the competitive backdrop? I think it's natural that it's gotten more competitive. It sounded like that in Christina's remarks. Can you maybe give perspective on how it compares maybe to last year or even pre-COVID? \nBrian Cornell: I think we've seen pretty consistent trends year-on-year. One of the things, as we think about discretionary categories, Simeon, and we talked about this in February at our financial community meeting. While we have seen some softness, last year, we generated almost $55 billion of revenue in those discretionary categories. And if we go back to pre-pandemic, we've seen sizable gains across all 3 of our major discretionary categories; apparel, home and hard lines. So there's still a consumer who's shopping those categories. \n There's certainly a competitive activity that we're watching carefully. But to Christina's point, we're trying to make sure that we're not leading the market down. We're using the benefits of Target Circle that personalized offers to those guests that we know are looking for those items at Target and blending the balance of our national brands with our own brands to provide great value each and every day. So those categories are still relevant to the consumer. As Christina mentioned, we see certainly dislocation in the retail market that's going to open up market share opportunities for us. I think we're going to start realizing some of that during the Back-to-College season. But we'll also see opportunities over the balance of the year and as we go into the holiday season, they continue to make sure guests are turning to Target for those discretionary purchases they're looking to make. \nSimeon Gutman: And then a quick follow-up maybe for Michael. The negative flow-through in Q2 looks like it's higher than that of Q1. And there is some movement in math given the comparisons here. Curious, why shouldn't there be more margin recovery in Q2 even on the negative comp or potentially negative comp? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I think I've hit most of the key themes there already. Just to repeat a couple, we're positioned in the top line conservatively and that means what leverage looks like in an inflationary cost environment throughout the P&L looks different planning for a slightly negative comp in our guide for Q2. So you see some deleverage there. And then we've talked a few times, the headwind of shrink will be present again in Q2, and that's more of a front half of the year thing than a back half of the year thing. But those would be some of the key things that we'll watch as the quarter plays out. \nBrian Cornell: Operator, we have time for 1 final question today. \nOperator: Our final question is from Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein. \nDean Rosenblum: I want to just follow up on the gross margin questions first. So you mentioned that relative to 2019, rate is a headwind, shrink is a headwind, et cetera. When we talked back in the fourth quarter event, we've asked about the notion of permanent sort of impairment to gross margins. We're looking at gross margin historically. In the second quarter with gross margin above 30%, can you give us some idea of where you might expect gross margins to come in for the second quarter? What might you consider middle slice and may be ambitious for gross margins for the second quarter? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Our expectations for both margin and SG&A and the rest of those are all baked into that EPS guide. And so as you guys know, we don't break out the specific components in our guidance. And the other thing I'd note, you probably heard me say this before, quarterly margins have more noise in them than I think sometimes the group here might appreciate. And so stepping back and seeing the margin trajectory over a longer period of time, I think, is going to be important. And we've got some work to do on that front. It's baked into our guide for the year to recover some of the margin pressure that we saw last year. \nBrian Cornell: All right. So that concludes our first quarter call. And we appreciate all of you joining us and look forward to talking to you later this year. So thank you.",

            "name": "John Mulligan",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. Through all of the rapid and unexpected changes we've experienced over the last 3 years, teams throughout our operations have done an amazing job, maintaining their energy, staying agile and doing everything in their power to serve our guests' ever-changing needs. And today, with 2 years of unusually rapid growth behind us and last year's excess inventory in the rearview mirror, we are focusing this year on training and development for our team with an emphasis firmly centered on retail fundamentals. Our goal is to reinforce the reliability and consistency of our shopping experience as we help our team members to succeed in their current job and build the right skills to prepare for the next one. \n More specifically, every store this year is engaging in assessments to reinforce consistently strong execution throughout the country and every day of the year. These assessments are centered on the factors most essential to operating great stores and delivering a consistent experience, ranging from staffing and scheduling to inventory management, in-store signing, digital fulfillment, guest and team member safety and the checkout experience.\n In support of these efforts, we're investing in training and development across every level of our team from entry-level team members to the store leaders. Beyond the reinforcement of everyday best practices, we're preparing our team to support new services including the upcoming rollout of Drive-Up returns and the opening of additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations. In addition, to develop our store supervisors and leaders, we're investing in a cohort-based peer learning model, in which participants engage in classroom experiences, one-on-one coaching and on the job practice. All of this training is designed to help our teams succeed today and build our pipeline of future leaders.  \n Of course, a foundational element of our team development effort is our education assistance program called Dream 2B, which enables our U.S.-based part-time and full-time team members to pursue tuition-free undergraduate and associate degrees, certificates and boot camps. This industry-leading program features tuition-free options in more than 250 business aligned programs across more than 40 schools, colleges and universities. Since the rollout of Dream to Be in 2021, tens of thousands of our team members have successfully participated in this program. \n As you saw in today's release, we ended the first quarter with a 16% less inventory than a year ago. This decrease reflects our current cautious position in discretionary categories, combined with the impact of excess inventory on last year's balance sheet. Those factors are being partially offset by some purposeful inventory investments. These include investments in support of our frequency categories, in light of the rapid growth we've been seeing and to ensure we're in stock. And I'm happy to say that these investments have been paying off.\n In the first quarter, out of stocks of our most important Food & Beverage and Essentials items, we're running at 3-year lows and trending in a favorable direction. In addition to support of our frequency businesses, we're also making strategic inventory investments where we believe we have a long-term market share opportunity, most notably in the upcoming Back-to-School and Back-to-College seasons. As you know, in our supply chain, we're engaged in a multiyear journey to modernize how we replenish inventory in our stores.\n When I moved into this position 8 years ago, store inventory replenishment was a standardized inflexible process. That placed a heavy burden on our store team members. With this modernization effort, our primary goal is to reduce those labor demands on our stores. We achieved that result by moving work upstream to a distribution center, where we can apply the appropriate processes, technology, tools and automation to accomplish the work at scale. This results in higher labor efficiency for the company overall while allowing our store team members to spend more time in the front of our stores with our guests.\n In the upstream distribution centers we've opened over the last 2 years, we've implemented technology and capabilities that improve how product is sorted and loaded on to trailers headed for our stores. These improvements reduce the necessary time for the store team to unload the trailer and for them to move the inventory to where it's needed in the store. In these new buildings, we've also invested to automate the sortation and packing of break pack items, facilitating the shipment of quantities smaller than a full case pack. This automated process makes the shipment easier to unload, reduces sorting time for the store team and lowers the amount of inventory in our store backrooms. \n Outside of our new facilities, we're working to roll out similar capabilities to our legacy distribution centers. In addition, throughout our legacy network, we continue to focus on reducing the overall cost of store replenishment by implementing automation, along with other improvements. For example, we've been testing ways to improve the lead time and accuracy of our deliveries from several of our existing buildings and have seen an increase in speed and lower out-of-stocks in stores service from these facilities.\n But I want to stress, automation is only 1 way to deliver value to our business. Consider our sortation centers, which are positioned downstream from our stores to provide speed and efficiency in support of last mile delivery. Our sort centers are not highly automated. Instead, they use technology and sophisticated process logic to sort packages and provide a faster and better guest experience at a significantly lower cost. In fact, it's because of the relative simplicity in the design of these buildings and the efforts of an incredibly innovative and energetic team that we've been able to scale the number of these buildings so quickly from 3 a year ago to 9 today. And an expected total of 15 or more in 2026. \n Beyond rapidly scaling the number of sort centers, our team continues to innovate around the existing processes in those buildings, finding ways to deliver additional value to the business. One example is a new facility that we opened earlier this month in Smyrna, Georgia. This new facility, which costs very little to open, serves as an extension of the existing sortation center in the Atlanta market extending the reach of our next-day delivery capability.\n With this new facility, online orders that have been packed by Atlanta area stores continue to flow to the sortation center, where they're sorted and delivered via our national carrier partners or a ship driver. However, a portion of local orders falling outside the sortation centers last mile delivery area can now be transferred to Smyrna extension, where ship drivers can pick them up and serve additional neighborhoods. \n With the opening of this extension facility, our next-day delivery capability is now reaching more than 3 million guests in the Atlanta market. As we mentioned at our recent financial community meeting in our Dallas and Minneapolis sortation centers, Target and Shipt have been testing the development of high-capacity van routes that enable us to bring last-mile delivery to a larger number of guests. In addition, over the past year, across all of our markets served by our sortation centers, we have shifted more routes to larger passenger vehicles and early results have been positive. \n Compared with routes previously served by sedans, SUVs and minivans can deliver more than double the number of packages per route while high-capacity vans can service nearly 5x as many packages. And beyond capacity, the use of larger vehicles enables further route optimization, increasing the number of packages that can be delivered per hour.\n With these changes, in the first quarter, approximately 65% of our last mile deliveries serviced by Shipt were made with larger vehicles compared with 0 a year ago. This resulted in meaningful cost savings for our last mile delivery program overall. Based on the success of these efforts, we're developing plans to begin testing high-capacity vans at a larger scale. In addition, we're developing a standardized faster way to load those vans, enabling package containerization and easy identification of the correct packages at delivery.\n In addition to simplifying the load process for the drivers, this new process will enable us to safely move a larger number of ship drivers in and out of our sort centers in a given amount of time, expanding our last mile delivery capacity in these markets. While there are many different ways our team is working to gain efficiencies and deliver value to the business, all of our projects have some things in common. First and foremost, they're all designed and implemented with a focus on our guests and continuing to build their engagement with Target. \n In keeping with that guest focus, we design processes and deploy technology and automation as a way to highlight the human element in our business rather than minimizing it. It's an essential element of our purpose to help all families discover the joy of everyday life. As I get ready to close, I want to pause and thank our team for bringing that purpose to life every day for both our guests and for your fellow team members. Here are the reason that guests trust and love our brand and why they choose to shop at Target.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Michael. Yes, I think -- as we think about mitigation efforts, I would go back to, first, what Brian said, it starts, first and foremost, with creating a safe environment for our team and for our guests. And there are multiple approaches to that, that also have a financial impact. So clearly, there is what we do with merchandise and how we display it and how we make that available to a guest. There is assortment changes that we can make to improve that performance as well.\n And then finally, there's security changes in the store that we can make. You put all 3 of those together and as you said, we introduced some of those last year. And over time, we do see the impact of that. We see improvement in the safeness of the store. We see improvement in sales and we see a reduction in out-of-stocks, all of which to us are positive indicators that we can make progress. And we'll continue to implement those. Now some of those create additional friction for our guests. It's on us to create the right environment with our team so that we reduce that friction as much as possible. But we do see, overall, again, through time, we see those things improve."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our team's discipline and dedication to staying in step with our guests, drove results that met or exceeded the expectations we set at our financial community meeting back in February. Q1 total sales increased 0.5%, reflecting flat comparable sales at the midpoint of our guidance range, combined with the benefit of sales in new locations.\n Profitability for the quarter was ahead of expectations. We came into the year clear-eyed about what consumers are facing with persistent inflation and rising interest rates. And we were determined to build on the trust our guests have had in target by unifying as a team to deliver affordable joy each and every day as consumers and businesses navigate, a third straight year of dynamic challenges. We knew this year would demand agility and teamwork and the ability to flex across our multi-category portfolio as we emphasize the categories our guests need most now. Well, our team did all of that in Q1, taking other step forward on our long-term growth trajectory. I might point to 3 unbroken years of traffic growth as a proof point.\n In the first quarter, comparable traffic grew 0.9%, even as consumers were becoming more cautious in their overall shopping behavior. That's a healthy indication of the trust, loyalty and strategic relevance we've created, especially given how much and how frequently consumers and the world circumstances have changed over those 12 straight quarters of traffic growth. Very few others can point to anything like that. This growth in guest engagement is the product of deliberate investments we've been making for many years. In all we do, we put the guests at the center, listening carefully to them and finding innovative ways to make their lives easier, more convenient and more joyful. \n And here again, both the balance of our multi-category portfolio and the flexibility of our stores as hub model are helping us stay in step with our guests. The mix of in-store shopping has been growing for well over a year now as consumers have become increasingly comfortable in public places. This has led them to choose more in-store visits causing in-store sales growth to outpace digital in the first quarter, both this year and a year ago.\n Notably, even within the digital channel, our same-day services, which rely entirely on our stores expanded more than 5% during the quarter. As usual, this increase was led by our Drive-Up service. We saw growth in the high single digits as more and more of our guests embrace the speed, convenience and reliability it provides. In total for the quarter, more than 97% of our sales were fulfilled by our stores.\n As it did throughout last year, pressure from inflation and rising interest rates affected the mix of retail spending in Q1, with a further softening in discretionary categories in the March and April time frame. This coincided with the deterioration in consumer confidence, reflecting recent events such as the banking crisis that emerged in March. These continued signs of caution among consumers have reinforced why we entered this year with a conservative inventory position. \n And as Michael will cover in more detail, we maintain that cautious stance throughout the first quarter and feel good about our current positioning in light of the trends we've been seeing. But as Christina will highlight in a few minutes, our cautious posture has not reduced our commitment to offering fresh, on-trend merchandise throughout the year. We know that newness is a critical element of what our guests expect when they shop with us. And even if they manage their household budgets and make disciplined buying choices, our guests continue to respond when we offer the right combination of newness, trend right fashion and affordability. That's what we mean when we talk about affordable joy. It's something that's core to our brand and a key differentiator in the marketplace.\n Beyond macroeconomic challenges, we continue to contend with significant headwinds caused by inventory shrink, building on a worsening trend that emerged last year. While shrink can be driven by multiple factors, theft and organized retail crime are increasingly urgent issues, impacting the team and our guests and other retailers. The problem affects all of us, limiting product availability, creating a less convenient shopping experience and putting our team and guests in harm's way. The unfortunate fact is violent incidents are increasing at our stores and across the entire retail industry. And when products are stolen, simply put, they're no longer available for our guests who depend on them and left unchecked, theft and organized retail crime to grade the communities we call home.\n As we work to address the problem, the safety of our guests and our team members will always be our primary concern. As a result, we are engaged in a variety of mitigation efforts, which began with significant resource investments to protect our team and our guests. In addition, we're installing pictures to protect merchandise and adjusting our assortment in affected stores.\n Beyond safety concerns, worsening shrink rates are putting significant pressure on our financial results. More specifically, based on the results we've seen so far this year, we expect that shrink will reduce our profitability by more than $0.5 billion compared with last year. And while we're doing all we can to address the problem, it's an industry and community issue that can't be solved by a single retailer. That's why we're actively collaborating with legislators, law enforcement and retail industry partners to advocate for public policy solutions to combat organized retail crime. As we communicate with those partners, we emphasize that we're focused on keeping our stores open in the markets where problems are occurring.\n Our stores create jobs, serve local shoppers and act as critical hubs in communities across the country and we'll continue to do everything in our power to keep our doors open. At the same time, we'll be closely monitoring the safety of our team and guests as well as the financial impact to our business as we determine the right path forward at Target.\n Even as we navigate through multiple short-term challenges, we remain focused on making Target stronger and better for all our stakeholders over the long term. Right now, our team is rallying around of focus on retail fundamentals to ensure we're staying reliable and affordable for our guests and that we're translating key points of difference like our physical proximity to the vast majority of U.S. shoppers and our emphasis on a joyful guest experience into unmatched ease and inspiration for our guests as we continue to grow and scale.\n We're also intently focused on creating easier and more efficient ways for our team to deliver on our strategy and fuel our ongoing growth ambitions.\n Underpinning all of this is our continued commitment to disciplined, return-based investments that will benefit stakeholders both today and well into the future.\n This goes well beyond our physical capital. As John will outline, we'll continue to make important investments in our team. This begins, of course, by building on the robust investments in wages and benefits we've made in recent years. Because of those past investments, today, we offer starting a wage range of $15 to $24 across the country. We significantly enhanced the health and wellness benefits we provide and tens of thousands of our team members are enrolled in our industry-leading debt-free college educational program. But our efforts extend well beyond the wages we pay and the benefits we offer. We are committed to building a culture of growth, providing our team with strong foundational learning, enhancing their skills and providing them to excel not just at their current role, but their next role on the Target team. as they continue to build a rewarding career with us.\n I want to close my remarks by thanking our team. Nothing is more energizing than the time I spend with them, from visits to our stores and distribution centers across the country to the time I recently spent with our headquarter team in Bangalore, India. Our team is proud to work at Target, and they show that pride through their actions every day, all in support of our guests. I'm proud to work alongside them, and it's a privilege to represent their efforts in venues like these.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. As Michael just mentioned, we don't build our strategy based on a single moment, but focus on the best way to serve our guests over time. We take that approach when we invest in our stores, in our supply chain, in digital fulfillment and our team. And as we've said many times, we also build our assortment to serve the long-term needs of our guests and the benefit of this flexible assortment strategy has been clearly evident over the last few years. Following the onset of the pandemic, we saw unprecedented traffic and sales growth in our discretionary categories. \n And now this year, even as guests are pulling back on discretionary purchases, we still grew traffic just under 1% in the first quarter as guests increase their spending in Beauty, Food & Beverage and Household Essentials. But a short-term pullback in discretionary purchases doesn't mean we'll turn away from our apparel, home and hardline categories. Instead, we'll continue to invest in them and deliver fresh new items throughout the year. That's because our guests continue to love these categories, and we're focused on building our guest engagement with them. \n Think about it this way. When I arrived at Target just under 9 years ago, our Food & Beverage category was underperforming and losing market share. But rather than turning away from that part of our business, we decided to lean in. We committed to the long term and engage in the hard work that we needed to improve our performance, ranging from our relationship with vendors to our French food supply chain, store labor model, assortment strategy and our own brands. Much of that work happened behind the scenes, and it took time before business trends in Food & Beverage started to change, but the work paid off over time. We entered 2023 following 3 straight years of unprecedented growth and market share gains in Food & Beverage, having grown that category by more than 61% between Q1 2019 and this year's first quarter. \n Beauty is another category where past investments are paying off. It's been performing well for years because we continually invested in the store experience, in passionate, talented and well-trained team members, in our digital experience and our assortment. Our growing partnership with Ulta Beauty is the latest example of how we're finding innovative ways to further enhance our beauty assortment and experience. And our business results clearly demonstrate that our investments are paying off. \n We've experienced double-digit growth in Beauty sales for the last 3 years in a row and just saw mid-teen growth in the first quarter. These examples demonstrate why we're investing and maintaining our long-term focus across the board on every 1 of our merchandising categories, fulfillment options, stores, services and our team, all in service to bringing affordable joy to our guests.\n If we do that right, we'll always be ready to serve our guests as their needs change, further deepening our long-term relationship with them.\n With that, we'll move to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. I'll let Michael start by talking about Q2, and then I'll talk about our focus on the balance of the year. You heard Christina talk about the changes we've taken from an inventory standpoint, the benefits that it's going to provide over the balance of the year, that gives us optimism as we think about the full year guidance. The combination of reduced inventory allows us to bring newness into our assortment, make sure we're on trend with the items we know our guests are shopping for, continue to leverage the traffic gains we've seen now for 12 consecutive quarters and balance the strength we're seeing in Food & Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty with the seasonal moments where Target shines. So as we sit here today, we're excited about Back-to-School and Back-to-College. We've got great plans for the holiday season. And Christina and her team have done a fabulous job of making sure we've got new on-trend items that are going to delight our guests and provide that affordable joy we're looking for each and every day. Michael, the only other thing I would add is as we think about leveraging our multi-category portfolio in this environment, we have the advantage of a nice balance between national brands and the continued strength we see in own brands, particularly at a time when our guests are looking for that affordable joy from Target. So we do think we're uniquely positioned to continue to maneuver through a challenging 2023 through the strength of our multi-category portfolio, the great national brand partnerships we have, complemented by our own brands and the flexibility we built into our system by reducing inventory and giving us the ability to flow fresh new items that are trend right for our guests. Karen, why don't I start and address the last point because as we sit here today, we think about what's happening from a theft and organized retail crime standpoint. It's an urgent issue, not just for Target, but across the entire retail industry. It is a problem that impacts availability of product, the shopping conditions are less convenient. And unfortunately, what I'm most concerned with is it puts our team and our guests in harm's way. So we are working right now with NRF, our partners at [indiscernible], other retailers across the country to make sure that we can talk to legislators that we can work with law enforcement to make some industry-wide changes and we're advocating for public policy changes to address the growing issues that surround all of us in retail today with theft and organized retail crime. \n Christina, if we talk about our approach to discretionary categories, I think we've been very clear about the fact that we've been trying to bring fresh new items and at a great price point and value that our guests are looking for. And Karen, I think that's been really consistent throughout the last couple of years as we've seen an overall decline in apparel sales in the industry, in home and hardline-related categories. But Christina can talk to the fact, in many cases, we're holding or growing share in categories that have been soft. But where we've continued to see strength in our ability to hold share and bring newness that's relevant to the guest. John, why don't you talk about some of the mitigation efforts we put in place? I think we've seen pretty consistent trends year-on-year. One of the things, as we think about discretionary categories, Simeon, and we talked about this in February at our financial community meeting. While we have seen some softness, last year, we generated almost $55 billion of revenue in those discretionary categories. And if we go back to pre-pandemic, we've seen sizable gains across all 3 of our major discretionary categories; apparel, home and hard lines. So there's still a consumer who's shopping those categories. \n There's certainly a competitive activity that we're watching carefully. But to Christina's point, we're trying to make sure that we're not leading the market down. We're using the benefits of Target Circle that personalized offers to those guests that we know are looking for those items at Target and blending the balance of our national brands with our own brands to provide great value each and every day. So those categories are still relevant to the consumer. As Christina mentioned, we see certainly dislocation in the retail market that's going to open up market share opportunities for us. I think we're going to start realizing some of that during the Back-to-College season. But we'll also see opportunities over the balance of the year and as we go into the holiday season, they continue to make sure guests are turning to Target for those discretionary purchases they're looking to make. Operator, we have time for 1 final question today. All right. So that concludes our first quarter call. And we appreciate all of you joining us and look forward to talking to you later this year. So thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In many ways, the themes of the first quarter operating environment were very similar to what we've outlined in recent quarters. So it likely comes as no surprise that we continue to face elevated volatility and see a reprioritization of spending away from discretionary categories in the face of persistent inflation in groceries and essentials. Despite the near-term challenges facing the retail industry and our business, we remain confident in our ability to generate long-term results, largely driven by the unwavering commitment displayed by the Target team, to our guests, each other and the communities where we operate. Guests continue to place their trust in Target, choosing to shop with us more and more often, at a time when consumers are hyper-focused on managing their budget.\n As Brian mentioned, American consumers continue to face difficult trade-off decisions as they juggle the wants and needs of their families. Consumer saving rates are down, and while inflation rates are finally declining, so is consumer confidence. The fear of a looming recession weighs heavily on many American families and though discretionary spending remains soft, our guests are still looking to sprinkle some affordable joy into their regular shopping at Target.\n In the first quarter, comparable sales were flat to last year, which was squarely at the center of our expectations. As you heard from Brian, we continue to benefit from traffic and sales growth in our frequency categories; Food & Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty, which helped to offset softer year-on-year sales in our more discretionary home, apparel and hardlines categories. Within the quarter, total sales were strongest in February, began decelerating in March and softened further near the end of April.\n Q1 performance was led by Beauty, which delivered comp growth in the mid-teens in light of continued strength in both Core Beauty and Ulta Beauty at Target assortment. Food & Beverage grew in the high single digits, reflecting broad-based strength across the category. Household Essentials delivered low single-digit growth, reflecting notable strength in both the health and pet care categories. Apparel, home and hard lines all experienced sales declines from the mid-single digits to low double digits as guests continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. Notably, guests are shifting to shop more just in time in these categories as they wait until the last moment before key events to invest in new decor or wardrobe refreshes.\n As we've been noting for some time, despite overall softness in discretionary categories, seasonal moments and newness in apparel, home and hard lines continue to be bright spots, prompting great responses from our guests. Within the first quarter, we had strong Valentine season and Easter holiday across multiple assortments, ranging from food and hosting solutions to decor and giftables. New offerings in apparel, including the latest wave of our designer dress collection and new sets in women's athleisure have seen incredible responses from guests. And this year's major theatrical releases such as Super Mario Brothers and the upcoming Disney film, The Little Mermaid, are driving outsized share gains and sales momentum. These examples demonstrate that when our assortments are fresh, seasonally relevant and affordable, that's a winning formula to engage and delight our guests.\n Given that consumers are cautious when buying discretionary items, we are being more declarative than ever about affordable joy and leaning into value messaging across all our media channels, in-store signing, merchandise displays and through our digital platforms. With a balance of strong opening price points, timely and relevant promotions, as well as a mix of competitively priced national brands and high-quality and affordable owned brand offerings, we have an opportunity to boldly demonstrate the power of Target's value proposition to our guests.\n As I've shared in prior calls, this is where the power of Roundel and Target Circle really shine through, creating collective value for our guests and for Target.\n With consumers more price conscious and focused on promotions right now, we know they're willing to search for a deal, but appreciate when we make the hunt easy for them. By utilizing our rich guest insights, we are best able to match the right product to the right guests with the right promotion. This is why we take such a differentiated approach with Roundel, thoughtfully and selectively connecting vendors and their products to our guests. Roundel's interconnection with the broader Target digital ecosystem means we are uniquely positioned to inspire the millions of users of our website, the Target app and other diverse media platforms. This helps vendors find consumers that are most likely to be interested in our products, creates awareness and conversion to new products for our guests through compelling deals and ads and drives top line and bottom line benefit to Target, all with an eye to enhancing the guest experience.\n Similarly, we know this personalized touch is why active Target Circle users make 2.5x the trips in Q1 compared to non-Circle guests and spent 3x more. Whether through everyday offers or member exclusive events like Target Circle week in March, we see incredible guest response to Target Circle promotions. Roundel and Target Circle provide opportunities for us to connect with guests in both the short and long term, offering instantly gratifying promotions in the now and a tailored and elevated experience that builds lasting affinity tomorrow and beyond. And beyond promotions and product placements, we know that when guests try our own brand offerings, they love the value and quality they receive, and this leads to repeat purchases. \n We also know that simplified, easy to understand, pricing promotion removes friction from the shopping experience, both in stores and online. This explains why our guests are responding to affordable home decor selections where we are expanding our assortment of items priced under $10. It's why we recently launched new swim assortments starting at just $12 and to help our guests get ready for summer celebrations of all kinds are only a Target Sun Squad brand, offers everything needed to be outside this summer with more than 60% of the entire assortment priced under $10 and nearly 90% of the assortment priced under $20. \n But our comprehensive view of affordability extends beyond compelling price points. In particular, our own brand portfolio offers an unmatched combination of quality and price. For an example, look no further than our $3 billion owned brand, Cat & Jack, featuring on-trend durable and affordable kids clothing. With everyday essentials like $4 T-shirts, $5 leggings, and $8 dresses and jeans, Cat & Jack offers both affordability and style. And because we stand behind not just the price but the quality of these items as well, we guarantee all Cat & Jack apparel for 1 full year with free returns should anything not meet our guest expectations. This is just another example of how we offer comprehensive value for our guests giving them affordable options without skipping on quality.\n As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we will continue the steady drumbeat of newness and value all while maintaining a cautious inventory ownership position in our discretionary categories.\n In terms of seasonal moments and holidays, Target teams are focused on helping our guests celebrate all summer long. Starting last weekend, we kicked things off by celebrating Mother's Day with affordable and inspiring ways to thank the moms in our lives, and we have plans to continue celebrating key summer moments [indiscernible] long wrapping up with everything needed to host the perfect Fourth of July Barbecue.\n With new summer Food & Beverage offerings, including more than 100 new Good & Gather items to target exclusive pickup offsets for amateurs and pros alike, we are listening closely to our guests and providing the hottest trends across our entire assortment.\n In apparel, guests will find vibrant color pallets across our offerings, helping all families celebrate summer and style. Best of all, these apparel items provide amazing value with clear, compelling opening price points.  \n For kids and kids at heart, the summer's roster of exciting movie blockbusters will find their way into multiple assortments ranging from apparel to toys to collectibles, featuring familiar characters from Disney, Marvel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and more. And because you can never have too much of a good thing, the latest assortment drop from Tabitha Brown just launched a few days ago. Already off to a fabulous start. This collection celebrates the joy that comes from gathering alongside friends and family, recharging in the summer sun and pausing for fun and games. The assortment includes over 60 items ranging from backyard entertaining essentials, games, tableware, outdoor furniture as well as guest favorite food items backed by popular demand. \n As we navigate this challenging environment, we will continue to lean into flexibility and focus on retail fundamentals while remaining vigilant in monitoring changing trends with the consumer and the economy. It's only because of our incredible team that we are able to stay nimble, listening for and quickly applying guest feedback into our operations. So our teams in stores, supply chain and headquarters locations around the world. Thank you for sharing your talent and passion and support of our guests. You are truly the best team in retail, and you bring Target's values to life each and every day.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to John. Chris, maybe I can start this one. We acknowledge that there's a lot of volatility and that we cannot predict the future, but our expectation is that some of the strengths of Target really amplified during the back half of the year. And it starts with what Brian said, Back-to-School, Back-to-College, where the full value proposition of Target is really put on display. You can leverage all 5 categories in our multi-category portfolio to achieve what you need for your families, buying backpacks and lunches and new outfits for school. And that really then sets up into a cadence of the fall with -- we start new fashion trends in September. We go into October with Halloween, followed by Thanksgiving and Christmas, and those are big moments for Target. \n On top of that, we do believe that there's some market share upside in key categories, especially in home, where we believe Back-to-College will benefit strongly from market disruptions in categories like domestic and kitchen appliances. So we're betting on some of those things as well as the newness and the agility that both Michael and Brian have spoken to that having the right fresh assortment and continuing to lead into the affordable side of that will give us momentum in the back half. Yes. I agree with Michael, 100% that we aren't looking to make those 2 trade-offs. What we do instead is we look at where is there potential for us to take share because our unique proposition in the market might play really well under these circumstances. But in the discretionary categories, we're going in with a very conservative posture. And so it's the strength of our multi-category portfolio and the guests choosing Food, Beverage, Household Essentials and Beauty that's creating the majority of the traffic gains that we're seeing right now. \n And I'm very confident about what that means in terms of what the guests are saying in the categories where there's the most price inflation and the most price sensitivity. They're choosing us disproportionately often, which I think is a very good sign of the relevance that we created. Now we will lean into newness, we will lean into affordable joy. We will lean into areas where the guests also are telling us that they're finding our value proposition to be relevant. That showed up in the first quarter in key seasonal moments and is why I'm excited about the back half because we have more of them and there's more disruption in key categories like home. Yes, that's absolutely right. We have been talking about unit share for many, many, many quarters in a row because in many cases, we didn't actually raise our prices as much as the market. And we maintained that affordability. And so that has continued to help contribute the traffic gains that we've seen and the performance that we've seen in aggregate. Our value proposition is always a balance between expect more and pay less, and we're always going to play up that. And so the opportunity for us is to make sure that we are cutting through in our -- with the clarity of our promotions that we continue to put those great items in front of the guests and our merchandise displays and that our website reflects the incredible value that we do offer. \n I would tell you though that something that we're leaning into that has the potential to continue to create relevance for our guests is Target Circle. Target Circle is our loyalty program. It's free, and it offers personalized promotions and it is -- we've seen that, that is generating better returns than mass promotions. And so our ability to not only create relevance for our guests, but deliver better returns for the business is a big priority for us. And that is part of the ecosystem the way we deliver value. The last part that I'd offer up, though, is because of the way we deliver value and our value proposition is about balance, it comes through a lot in the assortment and own brands play a particular role here. Not only are they great quality products that have been designed with specific guest needs in mind, they're also incredibly accessible from a price point perspective. And that's why you hear us talking a lot about that, particularly in this environment. Right now, there's no question that guests are seeking deals. The opportunity to balance their budget by finding deals is very visible. As I just talked about, the way that we're continuing to evolve our proposition is make sure that the deals that we do offer are certainly competitive with the market, but that they're increasingly more personalized. And as has been said a couple of times now, the inventory position that we're in right now gives us the ability to compete with the market but not chase the market down. And so that's what we're really excited about. We have an agile playbook that will allow us to continue to go after creating relevance for our guests and offering value but keep it rational."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, John. In many ways, the environment today feels completely different than 3 years ago when the pandemic was just beginning and no one knew what to expect, but today even as the pandemic feels further and further behind us, we continue to face elevated macro uncertainty and volatility as the world continues to transition toward a new normal. From a macro perspective, inflation remains high and stubbornly persistent, having recently peaked at decades high levels. To control this inflation, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates at an unprecedented pace. But for now, despite the building economic pressure from both inflation and higher interest rates, the U.S. unemployment rate is lower today than it's been in 50 years. And as Christina mentioned, consumer spending patterns continue to evolve, putting significant pressure on our discretionary categories.\n While I'm guessing we're all looking forward to the day when economic conditions begin to stabilize and normalize, I'm pleased that today, even in the face of all these challenges, we're continuing to see deeper engagement from our guests. That's most visible on our traffic, which grew just under 1% in Q1 and has now grown for 12 consecutive quarters. In fact, since 2019, prior to the pandemic, first quarter total sales have increased more than 43%. The vast majority of that growth is the result of an increase in sales per square foot over that time of which a significant portion has been driven by traffic. \n Total sales grew 0.5% in the first quarter, reflecting flat comparable sales, combined with the contribution from new locations. Total revenue growth of 0.6% reflected sales growth, combined with double-digit growth on the other revenue line, led by our Roundel ad business. As Brian mentioned, sales trends softened over the course of the first quarter. More specifically, we began the quarter with positive comp growth in the month of February and then saw the trends soften into low single-digit declines by the end of April and so far into May. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate of 26.3% was about 60 basis points higher than a year ago. Among the drivers, we saw more than a percentage point of favorability in merchandising, driven primarily by a reduction in freight and transportation costs, along with the benefit of retail pricing and a lower clearance markdown rate as we compared over last year's inventory actions. We also saw a small gross margin rate benefit from lower digital volume and a more favorable mix of lower cost same-day fulfillment.\n Offsetting those 2 sources of benefit, shrink reduced our gross margin rate by a full percentage point compared with a year ago. As Brian highlighted, pressure from shrink has continued to increase, and we now expect that if current trends continue, shrink will reduce our full year profitability by more than $500 million compared with last year. One note, the impact of merchandise mix on our first quarter gross margin rate was approximately neutral as the rate impact of sales declines in our highest-margin categories was offset by sales declines in lower-margin rate categories.\n Consistent with the guidance we provided for the quarter, our first quarter SG&A expense rate was 19.8%, up about 90 basis points from a year ago. This increase reflects our continued purposeful investments and paying benefits for our team, combined with inflationary cost pressures throughout our business against a backdrop of flat comparable sales, partially offset by the benefit of productivity increases and strong expense discipline across the company. Our first quarter D&A expense rate was down about 10 basis points, reflecting lower accelerated depreciation related to our remodel program compared with last year. Altogether, our first quarter operating income rate to 5.2% was higher than expected, due primarily to upside in our gross margin rate as the benefits from lower freight and transportation costs and our efficiency efforts offset a higher-than-expected impact from shrink.\n As John mentioned, Q1 ending inventory was about 16% lower than a year ago. Within that inventory number was a decline of more than 25% in discretionary categories, reflecting the excess inventory we were carrying last year and the cautious approach we are taking this year. Partially offsetting the decline in discretionary inventory are the purposeful inventory investments we're making in our frequency categories, along with some strategic bets in support of long-term share opportunities. We believe our cautious inventory approach has served us well so far this year and will continue to be the right approach going forward.\n As I turn now to capital deployment, I'll start where I always do, by reiterating our long-standing priorities. First, we fully invest in our business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we support the dividend and look to build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained since 1971. And third, only after we've supported those first 2 priorities, we deploy any excess cash to repurchase shares over time within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we made capital investments of $1.6 billion in the first quarter as we continue to remodel stores, open up new locations, build upstream inventory replenishment capacity and ramp up our sortation center strategy. \n With 1 quarter of the year behind us, we continue to expect our full year CapEx will be in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $497 million in the first quarter, up from $424 million last year, driven by a 20% increase in the per share dividend, partially offset by a decline in average share count.\n And finally, given the impact of the current environment on our financial performance, we didn't repurchase any shares in the first quarter. In the near term, we'll maintain that approach and don't intend to resume repurchase activity until it's compatible with our long-term credit rating goals. \n On that note, I'm pleased with our progress in strengthening our balance sheet. Even as profitability remains well below our long-term potential, we've already seen an encouraging improvement in our operating cash flows. More specifically, our operations generated $1.3 billion of cash in Q1 in stark comparison to a year ago when our operations absorbed $1.4 billion. This dramatic year-over-year improvement was driven almost entirely by changes in our inventory investment compared with last year.\n And finally, I want to end my review of the quarter with our after-tax returned on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months through the first quarter of this year, our after-tax ROIC was 11.4% compared with 25.3% a year ago, reflecting both the change in profitability and the increase in working capital we began to see a year ago. As we move further into the year, we expect to see higher profitability than a year ago and continue to benefit from the inventory efficiency reflected in this quarter's cash flow. Based on these expectations, we anticipate a recovery in the ROIC metric this year and expect to continue building back toward our longer-term potential in 2024 and beyond.\n So now let me turn to our expectations for Q2 and the full year. As I mentioned, on the sales line, we experienced notably softer comp trends as we exited the first quarter and moved into May. As a result, we're anticipating second quarter sales in a wide range centered around a low single-digit decline, consistent with those recent trends. In terms of profitability, we're expecting a range of possibilities as well.\n On the gross margin line, we believe that many of the same trends that emerged in Q1 will continue in the second quarter, including a meaningful tailwind from freight and transportation costs, and a significant headwind resulting from inventory shrink. Similarly, on the SG&A expense line, we'll continue to face broad-based inflationary pressures and expect to benefit from efficiency efforts and cost discipline across our team. However, if our second quarter comp sales end up declining in the low single digits, which is where they are trending currently, we'll see greater SG&A rate pressure related to cost deleverage than we experienced in Q1. \n In light of all of these expectations, we believe our Q2 operating margin rate will be much higher than the very low rate we earned a year ago, but lower than the 5.2% we saw in Q1. Altogether, our expectations translate to a second quarter GAAP and adjusted EPS range of $1.30 to $1.70.  As we look beyond Q2, we continue to believe that we entered this year with the appropriate level of caution planning conservatively in light of a tough macro environment and rapidly changing consumer trends. While we're facing some clear headwinds in the short term, we also have multiple actions underway to mitigate them, including ongoing efficiency work and cost saving efforts that we expect to flow into the P&L in the second half of the year.\n While we feel good about these efforts, we also remain cautious on the overall environment in light of the macro industry pressures we've outlined today.  Taking this all into account, we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided at our Financial Community Meeting in February. Namely, we're planning for full year comparable sales in a wide range centered around flat. We expect to grow our full year operating income by $1 billion or more, and we expect our business to generate full year GAAP and adjusted EPS of $7.75 to $8.75.\n As I get ready to turn the call back over to Brian, I want to reiterate my confidence in our longer-term prospects for profitable growth. Even today against a very challenging backdrop, we're starting to assemble the building blocks for a recovery in our operating margin rate back towards its longer-term potential. And while spending pressures in discretionary categories are currently outweighing the continued strong growth we've seen in our frequency categories, we're confident that the economy and the consumer will stabilize over time and will once again benefit from growth in the more discretionary portion of our assortment.\n In the meantime, we have the capacity to navigate this environment with a strong balance sheet and a resilient business model. We have the right long-term strategy, and we're privileged to work with the best team in retail. I want to express my sincere thanks to our entire team. You are, by far, our most valuable long-term asset.\n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Yes, thanks for the question. You said part of the answer right in your question. We continue to take a cautious approach to the top line. We think that served us really well in the first quarter. 1 of the reasons we got the profit outcome we did in the first quarter is that with inventory position conservatively, that gives us flexibility and agility. And so you'll continue to see us take that posture for the balance of the year. And that comes with an impact on the top line and the bottom line. Our leverage looks different at a slightly negative comp than it does when we're running a positive comp. \n A couple of other things that I dimensionalize kind of in how they'll paginate over the year, though. When the shrink with the current trends continuing, that year-over-year pressure from shrink is certainly front half loaded in the year. And so you see that impact in Q2 as well. And then we're excited about the continued work on our efficiency initiatives, and you'll see some of that come to bear in the back half of the year, too. So taking that all together, we feel good about the full year positioning, and we're appropriately cautious for the second quarter. Yes, nothing new to share on that front today. I mean, as we sit here 1 quarter into the year with a comp that played out kind of exactly as we expected and a full year guidance that we think is still appropriate. I think we're -- the underlying work in front of us to build back profitability, a meaningful piece of which is part of our plan here in 2023. It will be the first step along that path. Chris, the only thing that I might add to that is, that's all underpinned by a clean inventory position. I mean 1 of the benefits of planning inventory cautiously as we've got the flexibility to lean in to all the good stuff Christina just talked about. And so the end of the quarter, down 16% on a year-over-year basis, that's over 25% in the discretionary categories gives us a lot of room to maneuver as we get into the back part of the year. Yes. You're hitting on some of the 3 key big factors as we get into the back part of the year. We're pleased to see headwind on a year-over-year basis. From freight, we're in a better place now than we were a year ago certainly on that front, and that will continue as we get into the back part of the year based on how we currently have things projected.\n On the efficiency side of things, I mean, there's a lot within that. Some of that will come to bear this year. As we've shared before, importantly, some of that will come to bear over the next few years. But as an example of something that we'll see more benefit from in the back half of this year, sortation centers are a perfect example. We've got many more facilities open this year. They'll do a lot of business in the back half of the year. And so that's -- it's more sort centers helping deliver goods faster in a sort center market and save us some last mile shipping costs with our Shipt and drivers delivering those brown boxes. And so that's 1 of many initiatives that will start to bear fruit as we get into the back part of this year and the years to come. So I'll take a swing at that, Michael. The -- as I said in my remarks, the big drivers, speaking on a year-over-year basis of margin in the first quarter, we had a tailwind from freight. We already talked a little bit about the benefit we're seeing there on a year-over-year basis versus 2019, freight is still a headwind, to be clear. But on a year-over-year basis, we're seeing some benefit. We also saw some benefit on a year-over-year basis on the markdown and think salvage front as we recover from some of the inventory actions that we started to take last year. And then we saw the headwind from shrink, a full percentage point in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Like I said, if the current trends were to continue, we'd see that drag from shrink to be front half of the year loaded and kind of how it shows up throughout the year. But you're hitting on the key -- 3 key drivers on a year-over-year basis. I'm happy to start. Christina, feel free to chime in. We think about it a little differently than that, Michael, in that as we think about the last back half of the year, I mean, we're going to drive traffic in a lot of ways, but it's not a simple trade margin for traffic play. It's about being relevant for our guests in the moments that matter. And is evidenced by the strength in traffic we saw in Q1. With the balance we have across categories, we can appeal to whatever is at the top of the guest shopping list. And first and foremost, that's how we think about staying relevant and driving traffic. So our guide for the year unchanged at the end of Q1 versus what we said 90 days ago, incorporates our best view of how we see all of those puts and takes playing out. And it's a wide range on the top line and the bottom line, but we believe is appropriate from the variables as we digest them sitting 1 quarter into the year. Christina, feel free to -- is there anything you'd add? Yes. I think I've hit most of the key themes there already. Just to repeat a couple, we're positioned in the top line conservatively and that means what leverage looks like in an inflationary cost environment throughout the P&L looks different planning for a slightly negative comp in our guide for Q2. So you see some deleverage there. And then we've talked a few times, the headwind of shrink will be present again in Q2, and that's more of a front half of the year thing than a back half of the year thing. But those would be some of the key things that we'll watch as the quarter plays out. Yes. Our expectations for both margin and SG&A and the rest of those are all baked into that EPS guide. And so as you guys know, we don't break out the specific components in our guidance. And the other thing I'd note, you probably heard me say this before, quarterly margins have more noise in them than I think sometimes the group here might appreciate. And so stepping back and seeing the margin trajectory over a longer period of time, I think, is going to be important. And we've got some work to do on that front. It's baked into our guide for the year to recover some of the margin pressure that we saw last year."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 20, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Gomez, Chief Commercial Officer; Michael Fiddelke, Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Lee, Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Rick, Michael and Jim will provide their insights on our third quarter performance along with our outlook and priorities for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Jim and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the quarter and his priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond. Brian?\nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks today by welcoming Jim Lee, to his first conference call as Target CFO. Jim recently joined our team from PepsiCo, where he gained a wealth of experience in numerous positions throughout their business. Since he arrived here in September,  Jim has been learning our business, and I've been incredibly impressed with his ability to synthesize large amounts of data, drill into what's most important, generate innovative solutions when presented with problems and then take quick action to address them. I'm confident you'll enjoy getting to know Jim in the quarters and years ahead, just as I have over the last several months. I also want to thank Michael for stepping up and occupying 2 important roles during the CFO search process. He did an incredible job leading both the finance and operations teams over the first half of the year. And I know both of those teams are grateful for his leadership. And of course, I want to thank the entire Target team for their leadership in successfully navigating through a difficult environment this quarter, a period that included a number of performance highlights and which also presented multiple challenges across our business. Because of our team's dedication to serving our guests and their focus on delivering newness and strong value, we saw healthy growth in traffic throughout the quarter even as we encountered some macro headwinds that caused our EPS to be lower than expected. Despite these headwinds, we're encouraged that operating income has grown 6.7% through the first 3 quarters of the year. We're highly confident in our proven long-term strategy and in our ability to move beyond this current volatility. And importantly, we're continuing to make the right investments in our business that will help us deliver profitable growth in the years ahead. Among the drivers of our comp sales, traffic grew a healthy 2.4% this quarter, representing well over 10 million incremental transactions compared with last year. This growth in traffic was mostly offset by a decline in average ticket as consumers continue to spend cautiously, most notably in discretionary categories. Overall, our third quarter comp sales increased 0.3%, near the bottom of our expected range. As you know, we focus on traffic as a key indicator of guest engagement and the growth we've been seeing is a validation of our guest-focused strategies and our team's commitment to delivering newness, value and a differentiated experience. We continue to measure year-over-year increases in guest service scores, and we're really pleased with the response to thousands of price reductions we introduced earlier this year, which we're extending with another 2,000 more as we enter the holiday season. We've also seen strong results in the digital channel, which grew by nearly 11% this quarter. Among our digital services, we saw nearly 20% growth in our same-day delivery, powered by Target Circle 360, as more guests learned about it and respond to the value and convenience this service offers. We also saw double-digit growth in Drive Up this quarter, which accounted for more than $2 billion in our Q3 sales. We also saw healthy growth in our ship-to-home business in Q3, as guests responded to the changes we made to streamline the shopping experience, increased speed and reliability and lower our costs by moving more of our shipments through sortation centers. At the category level, we've seen persistent strength in beauty, which saw a comp increase of more than 6% in the quarter, while our frequency businesses delivered solid growth in both traffic and sales. And we're pleased with our relative performance first to the market in apparel, even with a small sales decline in an environment where we saw slow sales of cold weather apparel across the industry. Our other 2 discretionary businesses, Home and Hardlines saw continued softness in Q3 as consumers continue to spend cautiously in these categories. When we assess the consumer and macro environment, we're seeing many of the same themes that have defined the environment for some time. Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched and they're shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation. They're becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them. As a result, we're seeing a strong response to promotions than we've seen in some time. Yet consumers are still willing to spend when they find the right combination of newness and value and they're continuing to celebrate important seasonal moments throughout the year. Because they worked hard to control their day-to-day spending, consumers sometimes allow them sells to splurge a little bit when they find the right item or the right seasonal moment arrives. As Michael will highlight in more detail, our supply chain faced some unique challenges related to the East Coast and Gulf port strikes. In order to protect our in-stocks and ensure we're ready for Q4, our team changed the timing of certain shipments and directed a portion of our receipts to other ports. Receipt timing changes and the impact of softer-than-expected sales in discretionary categories, resulted in elevated levels of inventory earlier than in a typical year, leading to higher-than-expected costs in our supply chain. While we weren't pleased with this cost pressure, we are confident we took the right steps to safeguard our reliability, as our team's decisive actions protected Q3 in stocks while supporting our Q4 merchandising plans. Beyond the headwinds in our supply chain, we also faced some unexpected pressure in health care and general liability expenses this quarter, which Jim will outline in a few minutes. Another Q3 highlight was our most recent Target Circle week in early October. Guests are responding to the changes we've incorporated into this program, and they appreciate the value it provides at every level. We enrolled nearly 3 million new Target Circle members this quarter, and we'll continue making long-term investments in this loyalty program with a focus on reaching new members, and driving incremental engagement among our existing base. Beyond the profitable traffic and sales we see from Targeted Circle, this program also helps us learn more about our guests and their preferences, which in turn helps to fuel our Roundel ad business.  Roundel delivered mid-teen growth in Q3, benefiting both our total revenue and gross margin rate, while driving deeper connections among our guests, the Target brand and our vendors. In a few minutes, Rick will highlight our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season. And while we're really excited about them, we're also focused on controlling what we can control and planning the business cautiously, given the volatility we've been seeing. While we aren't happy about the reduction in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe we're managing our business appropriately, and we're helping our teams stay agile and ready to respond if we see our business accelerate. And our Q4 plan is focused on ending this year with an inventory position that will best position our business going into 2025. Importantly, we're still confident in our long-term strategy. Traffic growth shows that we're winning with our guests, and we're making the long-term investments that have delivered strong performance over decades. This includes capital investments in our existing stores in full remodels, smaller refreshes, and layout changes to increase the efficiency of our same-day services. We're investing in our digital experience and our website, app and our full menu of fulfillment capabilities to become even more reliable and convenient for our guests. We're investing in our new store program based on strong performance of this year's openings and a robust pipeline of new locations planned for 2025. We're making smart investments in technology, including AI, to allow our team to do more for our guests more quickly. We're investing in our own brand portfolio, which delivers a unique combination of style and value that differentiates our assortment from everyone else in the marketplace. We're delivering value through our investments in lower everyday prices and the deals we offer to our Target Circle members, and the compelling promotions we will deliver throughout the holiday season, and we're continuing to invest in our team to ensure they can deliver a differentiated, joyful target guest experience across every channel, every day throughout the year. With Thanksgiving right around the corner, I want to pause and acknowledge the efforts of my fellow team members, most notably in our stores and supply chain facilities. We've been spending months preparing for our busiest season of the year. Throughout the company, our team members bring enormous energy to their work. But in the fourth quarter, they shift into an even higher gear. I want to thank them for everything they do to make Target, Target. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRichard Gomez: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to highlight everything we have planned for this holiday season, but first, I'd like to start by sharing our current view of the consumer and some color around our third quarter results. As Brian mentioned, our view of the consumer is largely consistent with what we've shared in prior quarters. Consumers remain pressured, but are willing to spend when they find the right balance of on-trend newness at compelling price points. They continue to make difficult trade-offs trying to save on everyday essentials to free up some of their budget for those new must-have items. We often describe consumers as resilient despite the challenges they are facing, and that is still true. However, I might add something to that description today. Beyond resilient, consumers have also become increasingly resourceful. They know there are deals to be found, they're willing to wait for sales and willing to search across multiple retailers to find them. For example, our Target Circle week this quarter was one of our biggest yet. However, we saw a more pronounced sales dip both the week before and the week after the event, showing just how planful consumers are in seeking out promotions when they shop. Similarly, we saw consumers lean into everyday essential stock-up promotions throughout the quarter to further stretch their monthly budgets. Turning to the third quarter. Comparable sales grew 0.3% reflecting strong performance on our digital platforms, where sales grew nearly 11%. Throughout the quarter, we faced continued volatility across our business and broadly softer sales in discretionary categories as compared with Q2. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong reaction to promotions throughout the quarter. While the depth of these promotions was similar to last year, our guest responses to these offers were much more pronounced. Compared to a year ago, promotional markdown rates have increased meaningfully and year-to-date are up around 1 percentage point. In terms of category performance, sales and market share gains were strongest in beauty again this quarter with comparable sales growth of more than 6%. This strong performance was broad-based with growth in our core beauty business as well as our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings. Newness across the portfolio resonated with a wide array of consumers including growing affinity with younger Gen Z guests from Blake Lively's exclusive to Target hair care line, Blake Brown, to the continued success of many sizes that offer those little indulgences, our beauty assortment continues to be a standout with our guests. Our Food & Beverage and Essentials categories both grew in the low single digits this quarter. In food, strength span the portfolio. Guests particularly love the season's Halloween candy and snacks as well as new seasonal flavors from Good & Gather, Favorite Day with new on-trend flavors helping to drive preference for our own brands, which continue to gain share. In Essentials, new items in nutrition categories like meal supplements and protein powders are performing very well. Additionally, since the launch of our limited time offering, [ The Cuddle Collaboration ] featuring fun and stylish products for pets and pet owners we have seen a meaningful acceleration in comp trends in the pet category. And through the insights we gained from Target Circle, we can now issue personalized offers to guests that shop the collaboration and help them engage with our broader pets assortment in bigger ways. In apparel, despite our comparable sales being down a little less than 1%, we were pleased with our relative performance compared to the industry. Unseasonably warm weather made for volatile weekly and regional trends, but in weeks when we saw cooler weather year-over-year, comp growth ranged from the low single digits to the high single digits in those regions. This gives us confidence that our seasonal offerings are resonating with consumers and as weather turns colder more consistently, this should bode well for our apparel sales trends. Despite challenging weather, we've seen strength in our women's apparel business, including young contemporary, driven by strength from Wild Fable game day assortments, featuring mix-and-match apparel items and an array of team colors starting at $5 and everything under $30. Women's performance was also strong, especially with $25 all in motion leggings featuring incredibly soft fabrication with a pop of glitter. We've also been very pleased with the relaunch of our Intimates and sleepwear brand, Auden, which is outperforming our expectations. Consistent with industry trends, Hardlines categories continue to be under pressure, with comparable sales down in the low single digits. Despite this overall softness, we saw strong back-to-school performance with particular strength in backpacks. We've also seen new toy offerings resonating with guests, including the launch of Ms. Rachel Toys with characters and tie-ins to her wildly successful YouTube series. And finally, in Home, our third quarter comp sales were down mid-single digits. Trends were relatively soft across the portfolio with bright spots in decorative accessories, led by fall newness, which grew comparable sales in the mid-teens and our affordable home refresh program with key partners like Hearth & Hand by Magnolia and Threshold by Studio McGee, both of which grew around 40% versus last year. And finally, because of our unique well-balanced assortment, we can move beyond a focus on driving performance within our merchandising categories and create innovation and excitement between them as well in ways that others simply can't.  As a perfect example, in Q3, we introduced powerhouse brands, Elf Cosmetics and Stanley. So guests can now match their favorite lip gloss color to their trendy drinkware. This innovative program is selling incredibly well and shows how we not only act on current trends but help to create new ones as well. As we turn the page to Q4, those cross-merchandising opportunities only grow more compelling. In just 2 days, the most anticipated theatrical release of the year hits theaters. Universal Studios Wicked opens Friday, and we are so excited to be the ultimate fan destination for this film. We're offering more than 150 movie-inspired items spanning apparel, toys, beauty, food, home and more. Nearly 70% of the items are available only at Target, including an apparel line created by the film's costume designer, Paul Tazewell. Our guests will be immersed in the magic of odds through Wicked theme store displays, shop-in-shops, digital experiences and other surprises throughout the season. And beyond the wow factor of this exclusive assortment, we brought the magic to our marketing campaign, featuring the film Star Cynthia Erivo, with a huge response from Target and Wicked fans alike on our social channels. Building on the theme of creating magical moments in the fourth quarter, our plans for this holiday season are designed to inspire, wonder and ah. And throughout the holiday season, we want to make sure we offer the perfect balance of value, newness, ease, and inspiration. Value will be on full display all season long from our everyday low prices to compelling promotions that help families celebrate the seasons, after an incredible response to our price reductions on 5,000 everyday items earlier this year, we reduced prices on an additional 2,000 items to drive traffic and help celebrate the holidays. We'll also be returning with some popular promotions like our Deal of the Day, which started on the first of this month and runs throughout the holiday season. And new this year, we recently held an early Black Friday sale just a couple of weeks ago. It's hard to believe that Thanksgiving is next week, and from Turkey to tabletop to core, we have everything families will need to gather together. This year, we're bringing back our popular Thanksgiving meal deal, now only $20 for a family of 4 which is $5 lower than last year. The meal includes Turkey at just $0.79 per pound as well as stuffing in 5 additional side dishes. Plus, we're offering a wide variety of hosting and gift-giving options including fresh flowers, wine, Good & Gather Charcuterie trays and on-trend housewares from owned brands like threshold and Figment, and while our stores are closed on Thanksgiving Day, helping our team members to celebrate with loved ones, will be back added on Black Friday to keep the holiday momentum going. And when you don't feel like cooking on the day after Thanksgiving, well, we'll be helping out by offering a free frozen pizza for our Target Circle 360 members. And speaking of the day after Thanksgiving, we recently announced 2 exclusive Taylor Swift releases available only at Target that we'll be launching only in stores on Black Friday before moving the assortment online the next day, while supplies last. The official Taylor Swift, the Eras Tour book provides a comprehensive behind-the-scenes view into the cultural phenomenon of Taylor Swift, the Eras Tour, including never before seen photos and personal reflections written by Taylor. In addition, we have exclusive versions of the Tortured Poets Department, The Anthology on both vinyl and CD, featuring 35 tracks, including 4 acoustic bonus songs. And while these exclusives are sure to be top on Swift's wish list, we have exciting gifting options for everyone in the family, all at unbeatable prices. More than half of our holiday toys are under $20 and thousands of stocking stuffers are under $5. But we know that consumers don't want to choose between value and newness. They want both. And at Target, they won't have to choose. Our holiday assortment is our biggest ever with 50% more new items compared to last year. These include exciting new toys from the biggest brands like Disney, LEGO and FAO Schwartz as well as our only target brand, GiggleScape. In beauty, we'll offer more than 100 new items, including incredible gift set options. This year's assortment is a great range of giftable items starting at just $5 with nearly 2/3 of this assortment priced under $10. In food, we'll be offering more than 700 new items in on-trend seasonal flavors, featuring new cookie and ginger bread kits for the whole family to enjoy building and eating. And again, this season, our partnership with British retailer, Marks & Spencer, will offer the best shortbread, candy and Christmas treats from across the pond, and for the first time, new home items like London themed ornaments and mugs all under $20. We've also worked to make shopping easier than ever this season. Of course, guests can rely on our industry-leading same-day services like order pickup, Drive Up and same-day delivery with Target Circle 360, but we're also making it easier to determine that perfect gift. With the new gift ideas page on our website and app, consumers can be inspired to find a perfect gift for that special someone, all on a set budget. And for those who want to make it clear what they're hoping to find under the tree this year, our digital holiday wish list feature removes the guess work for their loved ones. Plus our price match guarantee assures guests that no matter when and how they choose to shop, they'll get the best prices we have planned for the season. And like the bow on top of that perfect present, our marketing will tie it all together, immersing consumers in magic, imagination, and larger-than-life moments. Target guests will be transported to a land of iconic peppermint swirls and fantastical forest landscapes from in-store pop-up experiences to holiday TV and social spots that will leave them feeling festive, we want all families to have happier holidays, courtesy of their friends at Target. As I get ready to pass the baton over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams for the many ways they show up for this brand, for our guests, and for their communities. Every day, I am humbled by the talent and passion this team brings. And I am reminded of how special it is to work among world-class colleagues, retail leaders and friends. Thank you all for all you do to make Target, Target. With that, I'll pass the call over to Michael.\nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, Rick. The fourth quarter is here. And in short, we are ready. While some consumers are already done with their holiday shopping,  some are waiting for those major promotional events like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, and others won't start thinking about their Christmas list until the last minute. And across the operations team, we've been forming our plans, securing inventory, assessing the external environment and preparing for the season for months now. As you heard already from both Brian and Rick, macro headwinds and increased volatility throughout the third quarter, both expected and unexpected, resulted in financial and operational challenges for our business. But despite these challenges, because of all the effort our team has put into the planning, we feel great about our ability to serve guests this holiday season. Beyond the normal considerations of running a large retail business, unusual weather patterns, port strikes and overseas port delays added to the complexities of the quarter. This year's hurricane season has been particularly devastating for so many communities. While we're grateful that our team members in affected areas are safe, we also know that the damage from Hurricanes Helene and Milton has been vast and impacted communities are still recovering. In advance of the storm, we closed dozens of stores and a few supply chain facilities to keep our guests and team members safe. After the storms passed, we carefully assessed each location and we're able to reopen nearly all of our facilities within 24 hours. these storms as well as unseasonably warm weather throughout the quarter, created higher spikes and lower troughs than would otherwise be expected, displaying the resilience of our supply chain in advance of peak holiday volume this quarter. We also successfully navigated the challenges presented by the port disruptions on the East Coast and Gulf ports. We have been closely monitoring the situation for months, in anticipation of a potential strike, our team took decisive action to route select shipments to West Coast ports to protect key seasonal programs for the fourth quarter. This came at a cost, but allowed us to be well positioned for our guests through the strike and into the holiday season. Thankfully, the strike was short-lived. We'll continue to watch the situation closely in the lead up to continued negotiations in January. We also saw higher-than-expected volatility in receipt timing in some Asian ports early in the quarter. Collectively, the impacts from the port strikes and receipt timing volatility drove additional costs in the quarter. Fortunately, our teams were able to navigate this volatility incredibly well. So our inventory position and operations are well prepared for the holiday season. One quick final note on inventory. Third quarter ending inventory on our balance sheet was about 3% higher than a year ago. That said, as we've done before, we often compare back to 2019 as a useful way to look beyond the volatility we've seen in our business over the last 5 years. And by that comparison, you'll see that our Q3 sales this year versus 2019 have grown slightly faster than ending inventory over the same period. I'd like to take a minute to thank those teams throughout our stores and supply chain at headquarters and around the world for managing through each of these challenges head on. Their care and commitment to each other and to serving our guests regardless of the trials at hand, makes me incredibly proud of this team, and it's the incredible work of this team that has us ready to delight our guests this season, with the type of amazing holiday experience you can only find at Target. Thank you, Team Target, for all you do to show up for this brand and for our communities day in and day out. As you've heard me share on these calls for a while now, we remain laser-focused on our retail fundamentals with the goal of continuing to improve our level of service for consumers. High on that list is our focus on being consistently in stock for our guests, when, where, and how they want to shop. And once again this quarter, our in-stock position improved meaningfully from already strong results a year ago. But as I mentioned before, in stocks are only 1 way to measure inventory reliability. If we have inventory on the shelf, that product is considered in stock, but that might not be enough depth to support the combination of in-store and digital demand. As such, we also track a metric we call purchasability which helps us protect our guests in-store and digital shopping experiences. Here's an example. If stock in an item begins to run low, we may choose to make the item temporarily unpurchaseable for same-day fulfillment in order to protect the in-store shopping experience. The team has been working hard to reduce the number of times this happens, and we're encouraged that consistent with our in-stock trends, we've significantly improved our purchasability metrics year-over-year. But to be clear, for both in-stocks and purchasability, we won't mistake progress for potential and we're hard at work to continue improving inventory reliability for our guests. Beyond making sure our inventory is in the right place, we also want to make sure our new stores are ideally located as well. Already, 3 out of 4 Americans live within 10 miles of a Target store, and our properties team constantly monitors population and migration trends to determine where a new location might best serve a growing community. This year, that work helped us secure locations for 23 new stores, 13 of which just opened this past quarter from Miami, Florida to El Monte, California, to Waukee in my home state of Iowa, thousands of consumers will newly experience the joy of having a target in their own backyards. And clearly, our guests in these neighborhoods are responding as this portfolio of new stores is performing ahead of our expectations. In addition to new stores, we're also investing in our existing store fleet from the work we've done to enhance our front of store experience to the investments we've made to find the top talent in the markets where we operate, we're relentless in our pursuit of making sure that our stores provide a joyful, convenient and efficient shopping experience. And while there is always room to improve by nearly every measure we track, our extensive survey data indicates we are making meaningful progress. More specifically, Net Promoter Scores for wait times at checkout lanes, satisfaction with team member interactions at both checkout and while shopping, ability to find products and the cleanliness of our stores are all up year-over-year. And of course, we're making investments in our digital business as well. And the name of the game here is speed across all types of digital fulfillment. In ship-to-home fulfillment with stores close to our guests and our sortation centers handling 25% more packages than last year, we're faster than ever, shipping packages to guest homes, helping power the healthy sales growth we're seeing in our Ship to Home business. In fact, as of the third quarter, average shipping times across our network are nearly a day faster than this time a year ago. We've also implemented changes to reduce split shipments, driving an increase in units fulfilled per package, eliminating a source of friction for our guests and reducing last mile delivery costs as well. Altogether, our sortation centers have saved the company tens of millions of dollars in last mile delivery costs so far this year when compared to other fulfillment options. And when it comes to speed, there's nothing faster than our same-day services, which is why we continue to rely on guest feedback to build upon these already loved services, making them even better. This year, our target app became available for use in Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, making us the first retailer to offer guests the ability to navigate to a store for a curbside order using these phone-based technologies. In addition, based on feedback we've received from our guests, we recently rolled out the ability to opt out of plastic bags for drive-up and in-store pickup orders. This not only allows us to better serve these guest preferences, it has also helped save the cost of millions of plastic bags. And finally, beyond the investments we've made in drive-up and in-store pickup, we've also been investing heavily in our same-day delivery capabilities through Target Circle 360. Since the relaunch of Target Circle in April, we've seen a meaningful increase in the number of Target Circle 360 memberships, and thanks to the incredible efforts of our partners at shipped, we are not only able to meet the rapid growth in demand, we've maintained the already high Net Promoter Scores this offering consistently generates. And of course, beyond same-day shopping, our shipped powered capabilities play a critical role in helping us deliver packages from sortation centers more quickly and less expensively than through alternative carriers. Before I pass things off to Jim, I'd like to echo Brian, and welcome him to his first earnings call. As Jim and I have worked together through the first few months of his onboarding process, I've already seen what a curious, compassionate and strategic leader he is, and I couldn't be happier to have him on the Target team. I'll continue to work closely with Jim as he ramps up in leading our finance function, and I'm excited to see what that team will accomplish under Jim's guidance and leadership. With that, I'll pass the call over to Jim.\nJames Lee: Thanks, Michael. I've long admired the Target brand and its differentiated positioning with American Retail. And since I've arrived here, I've enjoyed getting to know the Target team and gain a much deeper understanding of our business. I've also developed a greater appreciation for the company's long-term strategic advantages, including our unique stores as hub model that Target pioneered nearly a decade ago, a large, profitable and growing own brand portfolio coupled with an outstanding collection of national brands and unique partnerships. A robust business model that includes strong retail operations and a broad footprint of capabilities, including Target Circle, Roundel and our third-party marketplace, Target Plus, and a strong culture behind a capable team that's passionate about our brand and committed to caring, growing and winning together. Having gained deeper insights into these assets, I'm even more excited about our potential to deliver sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead. Turning to our third quarter financial results. Our comparable sales increase of 0.3% was near the low end of our expected range, while EPS came in below expectations due to soft discretionary trends and multiple cost headwinds, some of which were unique to the quarter. Among the drivers of our comparable sales, healthy guest traffic growth of 2.4% was largely offset by a 2% decline in average ticket. This decline was driven primarily by softness in our discretionary categories, where consumers are shopping cautiously as they manage their household budgets. Within the quarter, monthly comps were strongest in October as guests responded to our Target Circle week promotions and we saw sequential improvement in discretionary categories. While store comparable sales were down 1.9%, we were pleased with our digital comp growth of 10.8%. Within digital, same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360, increased nearly 20%. We also saw double-digit growth in Drive-Up and a healthy increase in ship to home volume. On the other revenue line, we saw growth of 11.5% in the quarter, driven primarily by continued rapid growth in our Roundel ad business. Our operating margin rate of 4.6% was down about 60 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the combined impact of softer-than-expected sales in our highest margin categories, and cost pressures on both the gross margin and SG&A expense lines. Overall, our gross margin rate was about 20 basis points lower than last year. Among the drivers,  we saw about 90 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs resulting from multiple factors, including the incremental supply chain costs that Michael outlined earlier and the impact of double-digit growth in digital sales. Offsetting this pressure, we saw about 50 basis points of financial benefit related to inventory shrink and about 20 basis points of benefit in merchandising. One note,  the gross margin rate impact of merchandise mix was approximately flat in Q3, down from a 40 basis point benefit in Q2. This change was driven primarily by a slowdown in our highest-margin discretionary categories, apparel and home, whose comp trends both decelerated about 4 percentage points when compared with Q2. Our SG&A expense rate increased about 50 basis points in the third quarter, reflecting multiple cost pressures, some of which were unexpected, combined with top line sales near the low end of our expected range. Among the most notable drivers, we saw higher-than-expected general liability costs, a trend that's occurring more broadly and higher-than-expected health care costs as well. Altogether, our Q3 GAAP and adjusted EPS was $1.85 compared with $2.10 a year ago. Year-to-date, both GAAP and adjusted EPS have increased 8.3% compared with last year. As I turn now to cash flow and capital deployment, I want to reiterate our priorities, which have been consistent for decades and remain firmly in place today. We first look to invest fully in the business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of growing the dividend annually, something we've done since 1971. And finally, we look to return any excess cash beyond those first 2 uses by repurchasing shares over time within the constraints of our middle A credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we've invested just under $2 billion in CapEx year-to-date, and with updated project timing, we expect our full year CapEx will be near the low end of our guidance range for the year at $3 billion or slightly lower. As Brian mentioned, we have a robust pipeline of new stores and remodels, along with supply chain and technology projects that we expect will generate strong returns over time. Based on expected project timing, we're anticipating 2025 CapEx will range between $4 billion and $5 billion, near the middle of the long-run expectation Michael outlined earlier this year. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $516 million in the third quarter, up from $507 million a year ago. And finally, we deployed $354 million to retire about 2.4 million of our shares in Q3. Given our cash position and our expectations going forward, we expect to continue repurchasing shares in Q4 as well.  Following my commentary on the quarter with some comments on after-tax ROIC, which measures the quality of our capital investments over time. In the third quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 15.9%, 2 percentage points higher than a year ago. While a mid-teens after-tax return is quite strong, our long-term plans anticipate further expansion of this metric into the high teens over time. Now I want to move to our expectations for Q4. As Brian mentioned, we're focused on planning the business cautiously based on the volatility we've encountered so far this year. Our expectations also reflect some unique attributes of this year's calendar including the loss of 5 shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and the shift in this year's fiscal calendar after last year's 53rd week. While these calendar impacts are difficult to isolate, we estimate they could amount to nearly 1 percentage point headwind to our fourth quarter comps. In addition, as we outlined a year ago, last year's 53rd week contributed about $1.7 billion to our total sales and an estimated $200 million to our operating income. Note that the extra week did not affect last year's reported comp sales as they're based on periods of equaling. With all that as context, I'll turn to our updated guidance. On the top line, we're anticipating fourth quarter comparable sales in a range around flat reflecting continued softness in discretionary categories and the calendar headwinds I mentioned earlier. If we end up near the middle of that Q4 range, it would translate to a slightly negative comp for the full year. On the bottom line, our expectations reflect this updated view of comparable sales, updated SG&A expectations, including ongoing cost pressures and our commitment to ending the quarter in an appropriate inventory position for the new fiscal year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we believe the P&L impact of inventory shrink will be approximately flat in Q4, and we expect to continue to benefit from our ongoing efficiency work. Altogether, our updated range for the fourth quarter, GAAP and adjusted EPS is $1.85 to $2.45, translating to an updated full year range of $8.30 to $8.90 a share. This new full year range brackets the lower end of our initial guidance back in March in light of the sales and profit headwinds that have emerged in the back end of this year. Having outperformed our profit expectations through Q2 it's disappointing that a deceleration in discretionary demand, combined with multiple cost pressures have caused us to take down our guidance after raising it last quarter. Given ongoing consumer uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to take this conservative approach while taking swift and disciplined action to position ourselves to win during the holidays and in 2025. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of our business, given the strength of our strategy, the assets we have in place and the investment projects in our pipeline. While current conditions are quite challenging, we're confident that demand in discretionary categories will normalize, and our team has shown they can find efficiencies to help offset the cost pressures we're facing. As Michael shared earlier this year, this company generated strong financial performance over the last decade, and I believe we can generate compelling top and bottom line growth in the decade ahead. As I said earlier, since I joined the team, I've become even more excited about our prospects, and I look forward to sharing our progress in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian?\nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Jim. Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on a couple of thoughts Jim provided in his remarks, namely, I want to highlight the assets and the strategy underlying our business model, and how we can leverage those assets to deliver on the long-term financial goals Michael shared at our Financial Community Meeting back in March. We often highlight how we work to differentiate our merchandising offering and shopping experience from others in the marketplace. In pursuit of that goal, we invest in differentiated assets across our business. These include the locations where we build our stores, our unparalleled design and sourcing capabilities, our huge own brand portfolio, best-in-class national brands and partnerships, an advertising business that far outpunches its weight and a rapidly growing online marketplace and Target Plus. We also have one of the largest loyalty programs in America, which includes a large and valuable payment card program and a nationwide same-day delivery service. In support of these capabilities, we have made significant investments to build the best team in retail, across our stores, supply chain and headquarters, all of whom are aligned behind our brand. We put these assets to work through a differentiated strategy that includes our unique storage and sub model, a curated merchandising approach that spans both wants and needs and a fulfillment offering that highlights speed and convenience, while leaning into the power of genuine human interaction. Those are combined with a singular focus on value that includes low prices and compelling deals, combined with an elevated assortment and experience. So even as we encounter short-term headwinds, like we've seen recently, we immediately focus on leveraging our assets and strategy to move beyond those challenges. For example,  while we're confident that discretionary demand will normalize over time, we can continue to lean on our beauty and frequency categories to help offset those top line pressures, just as we have over the last couple of years. And when we begin to see unexpected cost pressures like we've encountered recently, we look for ways to leverage growth in Roundel and our ongoing efficiency work to help offset those pressures. But it all starts with the consumer, focusing on our guests and building deeper engagement with them serves as the underlying foundation of our work to build a profitable and sustainable business and deliver for our shareholders over time. I'd point out our Q3 traffic growth of 2.4%, representing more than 10 million additional transactions compared with last year as evidence of that focus. As we sit here today,  we're confident we have the right assets, the right strategy and the right team in place to attain our strategic and financial goals. As always, we appreciate your engagement and your participation in this call, and look forward to sharing our progress with you over time. With that, we'll turn to your questions. Now Rick, Michael, Jim and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on the unique costs that you mentioned, can you tell us or quantify what the magnitude was? How it was split among gross and SG&A, and if you can, what level of unique costs are embedded into the fourth quarter guidance?\nBrian Cornell: Michael, do you want to start?\nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, I'd be happy to. Thanks for the question, Simeon. If you step back and look at the profit outcomes in Q3 and what's on our mind as we guide for Q4, and Jim summarized a lot of it in his remarks. I'd start with, we saw a deceleration in a couple of our highest margin categories. So home and apparel, both decelerated about 4 percentage points from Q2. And so the profit impact of the softer-than-expected sales we certainly felt in Q3, and we believe we've got the business guided appropriately cautiously in those categories as we think to Q4, and we're committed to ending the year clean from an inventory perspective. You click further down the list. I mentioned in my remarks, we had some additional costs as we prepositioned some inventory in advance of preparing for the port strike, that's obviously unique to this year thing. We feel like it was the right decision, ensure we're in stock in a situation that we were monitoring closely, and we were pleased with how that played out from a guest experience perspective. And then Jim also mentioned a few unique things on the SG&A side. And while I have a ton of confidence in the team's ability to find efficiencies to offset some of those headwinds over time, that's not always appropriate or prudent to do within a month or a quarter. You can do some shortsighted things if you pull the wrong levers too quickly there. But given this team's track record of building back profitability over time, I have a lot of confidence we'll find the right efficiencies for us.\nBrian Cornell: Jim, anything else you want to add? .\nJames Lee: Yes. I mean specifically on the SG&A line, we mentioned general liability and health care costs. You can dimensionalize that as approximately 1% of the increase in SG&A that you saw in the quarter. .\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Can I ask a follow-up maybe for Brian or Rick? This year was about reinvigorating top line and you've introduced newness and innovation to try to push through this backdrop.  The consumer is not showing up. And I know you're not discouraged by it, but does your approach or the risk appetite and what you're doing change, especially as you holiday and you're going to try to end the year clean, do you step back? Or do you keep pushing through, and taking a little more risk?\nBrian Cornell: Yes. Simeon, well, we certainly have to embrace some of the short-term macro challenges. You've heard us say this for years, we're going to play the long game and make sure we're doing the right thing for the long-term interest of our company and shareholders, and even in a difficult Q3 environment, one of the things we've highlighted is the strength in traffic, up 2.4%, that equates to 10 million incremental transactions during the quarter. So we feel really good about the fact that consumers are choosing target, whether it's in-store or online. We feel really good about the expansion of our digital performance, and that bodes well for the short term. But certainly, long term, we're going to continue to lean into our digital assets. So seeing digital grow by almost 11% is really encouraging. We've talked about the importance of our Target Circle 360 delivery to home program, and that grew at almost 20%, and we'll continue to make sure we're investing in building awareness around that unique capability. Drive Up continues to be a point differentiate for us and again saw double-digit growth, and it's a really important part of our digital offering. So while there's some unique short-term headwinds we're facing, we're going to play the long game, continue to invest in value and newness. And we saw some bright spots even in discretionary categories. Michael and Rick have both talked about the deceleration we saw in apparel. But we continue to take share in those categories. And even within apparel, there's some real bright spots. We think about how we're performing with all in motion and the apparel performance category, growing double digits, taking share in that very important category, both short term and long term. So we'll continue to make sure we're investing in newness, investing in value, investing in our stores and digital channel and playing the long game. And I think there's a number of green shoots in front of us that we're going to continue to leverage in the fourth quarter, but certainly in the 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. .\nRupesh Parikh: So just going back to the lingering discretionary category weakness. What's your team's latest thoughts on the recovery in discretionary, do you expect a better outlook in 2025?\nBrian Cornell: Rick you want to spend some time talking about what we're seeing in some of our big discretionary categories?\nRichard Gomez: Sure. I'd be happy to. And I'd start with apparel. We are pleased with our apparel performance, while it was slightly down in the third quarter, there are lots of bright spots. In particular, we are very excited about what we're seeing with performance, our all in motion brands delivering double-digit growth. We're excited about that. It's based on new fabrication, new colors, an outstanding price point at leggings at $25, bras at $16. And we're also seeing bright spot in women's apparel, both a new day in Wild Fable, our young contemporary brand, both of which are bringing new styles, new fashion, new colors, and we're seeing the consumer respond to that. And we expect that to continue. It's also worth noting when we saw the weather break in select markets, we saw a 600 basis point improvement. And that really bodes well for our apparel assortment as the weather gets colder consistently. And then if you think about some of our other discretionary categories, both Home and Hardlines, they're challenged from an industry perspective, and we're not happy with where we are. We want to get these businesses to growth. But what we would say is there are some bright spots. In particular, I would focus on home. When we deliver newness in home, we see the consumer respond. We're seeing that right now with some of our key partnerships, whether it's Hearth & Hand with Magnolia or its Threshold with Studio McGee. When we launched that fall newness, the consumer is responding. And so that is very encouraging for us. And then within Hardlines, that, like I said, is a challenge from an industry perspective. We don't see consumers buying big-ticket items like TVs. However, they are looking for affordable ways to freshen up their home. They're looking for ways to add a little bit of seasonal to core. So we see decorative accessories, things like frames, candles, vases performing really well, delivering growth, and that, we think, also bodes well as we go into the holidays, and we expect consumers to want to continue to refresh in their home with the new holiday decor. So as we look at the discretionary business, what we see is the consumer is willing to shop as long as it's new, it's on trend and at affordable price .\nBrian Cornell: Rupesh, I would only add a couple of points, as we think about 2025, those discretionary categories will continue to represent upwards of 50% of our business. As Rick just discussed, we'll continue to lean into innovation and newness and value, and we've got to make sure we don't get ahead of the consumer and ahead of the macro trends. So we'll plan appropriately. We'll plan cautiously. We'll look for green shoots and will follow trends, but we've got to make sure we're staying in step with the consumer.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKatharine McShane: You made a pointed comment about how consumers are waiting for sales and leaning into promotions more so than they did previously, it sounds like even compared to last quarter. I was just curious on why do you think this is happening now as I think the consumer has been choiceful and making decisions for a while now. And has this caused you to alter how you're approaching Q4 when it comes to pricing and promotions?\nBrian Cornell: Kate, it is a trend we've seen for quite some time now. And I think over the last couple of years, we've talked about a very resilient consumer. I think sitting here today, we'll change it to a resourceful consumer. And I think as we look at shopping behavior and certainly behavior we've seen in Q3, and we expect to see going into Q4, we know that consumers are looking for value, they are looking for promos and deals when they're shopping for those everyday essentials. And they're shopping carefully and taking some of those savings to find those unique items in discretionary categories that they really want. We think that's going to continue. So we're going to make sure that we're leaning into the right value throughout the holiday season, bundling that newness with great value and recognizing that we got to make sure we're staying again in step with that consumer, providing the value, the uniqueness that they're looking for when they shop Target. That's a trend that I think we are going to see in the fourth quarter, and we'll certainly see some of that continue in 2025.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. .\nMichael Lasser: My first question is, in a world where consumers are concentrating their spend amongst a very few number of retailers, does Target need to do anything different or invest anymore to increasingly be among that consideration set and position itself in an even better way to generate more consistent performance?\nBrian Cornell: Michael, I'm happy to start and then invite Michael and Jim and Rick to add their perspective. But I think we've got to continue to make sure Target is being Target. And we're using our unique mix of great national brands, our strength in own brands, those unique partnerships. Rick talked about an exciting partnership that will come to life on Black Friday, partnering with Taylor Swift, which will be a traffic driver for our business during an important holiday period. But we're going to continue to invest in our stores, Michael talked about, we're really encouraged with some of the new stores we've opened in 2024. We've had a big pipeline over the next 10 years. We know expanding our footprint is going to be important. We'll continue to lean into our digital assets, and we saw some great proof points in Q3. We've got to continue to build out our digital assets, whether it's pickup or drive up or delivery to home, we'll continue to lean into those spaces. So we're going to continue to make sure we're delivering the delight and the joy consumers are looking for, they expect from us, whether they're shopping our stores, visiting our sites. We'll continue to deepen our partnerships with national brand partners, accelerate our own brand portfolio, and constantly look for those new partnerships that drive traffic and engagement in our brand. We'll continue to lean into our Circle program, and we talked about in Q3 alone, we had another 3 million members, that's an important way for us to continue to deepen our engagement. We're very pleased with the work we're doing on the retail media side, and Roundel has become a critical asset for us. and we saw again mid-teen growth in the third quarter. We'll continue to deliver in that space for years to come. So we'll continue on our current strategy, stay in step with the consumer and make sure Target is doing the things that consumers across America expect from us.\nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, I'm happy to build just a little bit on that. You've heard us say before, Michael, we've got a consumer, our guests who likes to shop, and I'll remind everyone that we round to maybe a 3 share in the categories in which we compete. So we see a lot of runway for growth over time, and we're excited about the foundation we're building now in support of that. Brian touched on a few of the things, but maybe just to double-click into the strength of the digital business that we saw in the quarter. Digital up almost 11%, real strength around some intentional work the team did to relaunch Circle with the Circle 360 program to see same-day delivery growing by 20%. And I remind everyone that that's a really important investment in the long term. We know when we make it easy to shop Target in all those different ways, guest will reward us with more spend at Target over time. And so that increased spend in total, that increase spend even in store that comes when a guest becomes a Circle 360 member that uses the same-day delivery. We're really excited about some of the foundation that we're building for the long term. You can see it in the digital growth and the way that will pay off over time, you can see it in the traffic numbers, and so we're managing the short term appropriately, but making the right investments for the long term.\nRichard Gomez: I do think what differentiates Target is our multi-category business. And so as we go into the holiday season, you can get the turkey meal for $20 for a family of 4, but you can also get the tabletop decor. You can get the home decorations. And with our party shop, you can now get all of the apparel for those festifications through the season. So I do think that is something that really differentiates Target is our one-stop shop for everything that you need for the holiday season.\nBrian Cornell: And while I know Jim is still new to Target, I'd love to get his early perspective.\nJames Lee: Yes. I mean, Michael, it's a great question. I mean I think just 2 months in, it's clear to me that making sure that we are unique, and we are Target, being Target. That's important for how we think about our business and even just to extend it to our third-party marketplace Target Plus.  We carefully carried our partners to make sure that we're on brand as we think about growth in that category and that business model. So it's important for us to ensure we stay on brand. .\nBrian Cornell: Michael, I thought you did a terrific job on CNBC this morning, kind of talking about the state of the state, and we've already spent a lot of time today talking about some of the macro headwinds we're facing in discretionary categories. We know over time, those trends will reverse. And it's still going to be really important that we're a destination for apparel and provide great design and style and on-trend apparel. We know the home category will rebound over time. We know America is going to buy sporting goods and toys. So there's some macro short-term headwinds that we've got to embrace and understand. But long term, we think the strength of our business model, our multi-category portfolio, that unique blend of national brands and own brands, the strength we have in both a great physical experience and a digital experience, those are going to be the hallmarks of Target going forward, and we've got to make sure we're focused on the long term and leaning into the things that American consumers expect from Target.\nMichael Lasser: Brian, if I could just follow up on that one last one which is the message that investors are interpreting from some of the discussion today is that Target is going to have a lot of upside when the discretionary categories improve, it's focused on newness, and the innovation that Target is known for in the marketplace. So is the message that investors should interpret that maybe some of the consistency that others are reporting is not present with Target right now, but there's going to be more upside with Target as there is a recovery in some of these areas? And would you be willing to trade some of the upside in those areas for even more consistency from quarter-to-quarter?\nBrian Cornell: Michael, we certainly see upside in the future and some of the macro trends change. But sitting here today, we're leaning into the things that consumers want. And Rick talked about some of the strength in our food and beverage business, the strength in essentials, the strength in beauty. We want to make sure we're continuing to lean into those trends and consistently growing the top line, improving our share position, we're going to make sure that we're ready for these big seasonal moments. And despite some of the macro headwinds we've seen really for 8 or 9 quarters in discretionary categories, we continue to see a consumer who's shopping for those seasonal moments and whether it's celebrating Mother's Day or Fourth of July, getting ready for Halloween, that Thanksgiving meal and the Christmas season, we know those are still really important moments for consumers. Those are Target moments, and we're going to make sure we lean in and win. So we're certainly looking for an improvement in our performance over time. We're not pleased where we are today, but we see a lot of green shoots and a lot of long-term opportunities to continue to advance our business, a destination for consumers who are shopping our stores or visiting our online assets and continue to be that place where consumers come for that magical Target experience where we bring those great national brands, our great own brands, and those unique partnerships that you can only find at Target.\nOperator: Our next question is from Karen Short with Melius Research.\nKaren Short: So I have 3 questions that are a little unrelated. The first is, as it relates to apparel, what is fashion as a percent of sales versus basics? And would you look to pivot a little more into basics versus fashion. The second question is, how to think about inventory risk if there is any in 4Q? And then third is just CapEx at 4% of sales. Is that now in a steady state?\nBrian Cornell: Karen, I'll let Rick talk about apparel, let Michael talk about inventory. And we'll let Jim talk about our CapEx and think about the coming year. Rick, do you want to start with apparel? .\nRichard Gomez: Sure. I'll start with apparel. And kind of in short, how we think about apparel and how we think about the trends is really listening to the consumer, putting the consumer first. We have a really, really talented design team who are always looking at what is emerging, what's going to be relevant and what's going to resonate with the guests. . And right now, what we're seeing is newness, fashion, style, trend at a really compelling price. And it's that combination that is really working. Wild Fable is a perfect example of that, when we get those both right, the fashion plus the right price point, the right fabrication and colors, we see the consumer respond.\nMichael Fiddelke: On the inventory side, Karen, we've touched a little bit on this already. But if you look at the balance sheet, we're up about 3% year-over-year as we closed the quarter. And we feel good that we're well positioned to be in stock across the balance of the holiday season. If you walk through the front doors of a Target store right now or see us online, it's great to see an excellent trim set. It's great to see the newness in apparel. And so we think we're well positioned for the holidays. It's also important that we finish the year clean from an inventory perspective, and we feel really good that we've got the fourth quarter guided in a position that allows us to accomplish that goal.\nBrian Cornell: Jim?\nJames Lee: And then on CapEx, as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll close this year at about $3 billion or slightly lower than that. And then looking out to 2025, as we look at our pipeline of new stores and remodels and technology and supply chain investments, we're anchoring at about $4 billion to $5 billion of CapEx for 2025.\nBrian Cornell: Operator, I know we're running a little long, but why don't we take 1 last question today.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. .\nRobert Ohmes: I think one thing that would be helpful, is there any sort of how should we think of what the onetime impacts are from supply chain inefficiencies and receipt timing? And is there any way to quantify the pressures that were sort of onetime in the third quarter and maybe in the fourth quarter as well that you could get back next year? And then I also just wanted to clarify, was -- were there any sales impacts related to supply chain or receipt of goods that impacted 3Q or that are also going to impact sales in the fourth quarter? And then the last question is, the Target Circle relaunch. Is Target Circle impacting costs on a negative way more than you would have expected following that launch?\nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Thanks for the question, Robbie. I'll kind of go back a little bit to my answer to Simeon's question. If you think about the big factors in Q3 and the things that are on our mind as we guide for the fourth quarter, it's being appropriately cautious based on the trends we've seen in the discretionary categories. And some of that deceleration shows up the profit outcomes in Q3 and factors into our guide for Q4. Apparel and home are high-margin category, isn't to see them decelerate like they did that factors into our profit outcomes and our guidance and important, we want to end the year clean in both of those categories. As you click further down the P&L, there were some things that were certainly more unique due to factors this year, like moving inventory around the port strike, and we feel good that we're on the other side of that now, and then further down the P&L on the expense side, we saw some expenses creep up versus the trends that they had, had prior to what we've seen earlier in the year, and we'll work to manage through those over time. And like I said, progress the team has made in efficiency work over time gives me a lot of confidence that we'll be able to work to build back against that. But it all starts with the top line, the investments we're making in the top line. And even your last question on the Circle 360 launch, I think, is a great may be place to bridge to because we're really excited with the guest response we've seen in Circl360. It's great to see us add 3 million new members to Circle in total.  it's great to see same-day delivery growing at almost 20% in the quarter. And we think those are all things that are quite accretive to the top line and the bottom line over time.\nBrian Cornell: Operator, that concludes our third quarter call. I appreciate everyone joining us, and wish you a happy holiday. We'll see you in 2025.\nOperator: Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Richard Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to highlight everything we have planned for this holiday season, but first, I'd like to start by sharing our current view of the consumer and some color around our third quarter results. As Brian mentioned, our view of the consumer is largely consistent with what we've shared in prior quarters. Consumers remain pressured, but are willing to spend when they find the right balance of on-trend newness at compelling price points. They continue to make difficult trade-offs trying to save on everyday essentials to free up some of their budget for those new must-have items. We often describe consumers as resilient despite the challenges they are facing, and that is still true. However, I might add something to that description today. Beyond resilient, consumers have also become increasingly resourceful. They know there are deals to be found, they're willing to wait for sales and willing to search across multiple retailers to find them. For example, our Target Circle week this quarter was one of our biggest yet. However, we saw a more pronounced sales dip both the week before and the week after the event, showing just how planful consumers are in seeking out promotions when they shop. Similarly, we saw consumers lean into everyday essential stock-up promotions throughout the quarter to further stretch their monthly budgets. Turning to the third quarter. Comparable sales grew 0.3% reflecting strong performance on our digital platforms, where sales grew nearly 11%. Throughout the quarter, we faced continued volatility across our business and broadly softer sales in discretionary categories as compared with Q2. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong reaction to promotions throughout the quarter. While the depth of these promotions was similar to last year, our guest responses to these offers were much more pronounced. Compared to a year ago, promotional markdown rates have increased meaningfully and year-to-date are up around 1 percentage point. In terms of category performance, sales and market share gains were strongest in beauty again this quarter with comparable sales growth of more than 6%. This strong performance was broad-based with growth in our core beauty business as well as our Ulta Beauty at Target offerings. Newness across the portfolio resonated with a wide array of consumers including growing affinity with younger Gen Z guests from Blake Lively's exclusive to Target hair care line, Blake Brown, to the continued success of many sizes that offer those little indulgences, our beauty assortment continues to be a standout with our guests. Our Food & Beverage and Essentials categories both grew in the low single digits this quarter. In food, strength span the portfolio. Guests particularly love the season's Halloween candy and snacks as well as new seasonal flavors from Good & Gather, Favorite Day with new on-trend flavors helping to drive preference for our own brands, which continue to gain share. In Essentials, new items in nutrition categories like meal supplements and protein powders are performing very well. Additionally, since the launch of our limited time offering, [ The Cuddle Collaboration ] featuring fun and stylish products for pets and pet owners we have seen a meaningful acceleration in comp trends in the pet category. And through the insights we gained from Target Circle, we can now issue personalized offers to guests that shop the collaboration and help them engage with our broader pets assortment in bigger ways. In apparel, despite our comparable sales being down a little less than 1%, we were pleased with our relative performance compared to the industry. Unseasonably warm weather made for volatile weekly and regional trends, but in weeks when we saw cooler weather year-over-year, comp growth ranged from the low single digits to the high single digits in those regions. This gives us confidence that our seasonal offerings are resonating with consumers and as weather turns colder more consistently, this should bode well for our apparel sales trends. Despite challenging weather, we've seen strength in our women's apparel business, including young contemporary, driven by strength from Wild Fable game day assortments, featuring mix-and-match apparel items and an array of team colors starting at $5 and everything under $30. Women's performance was also strong, especially with $25 all in motion leggings featuring incredibly soft fabrication with a pop of glitter. We've also been very pleased with the relaunch of our Intimates and sleepwear brand, Auden, which is outperforming our expectations. Consistent with industry trends, Hardlines categories continue to be under pressure, with comparable sales down in the low single digits. Despite this overall softness, we saw strong back-to-school performance with particular strength in backpacks. We've also seen new toy offerings resonating with guests, including the launch of Ms. Rachel Toys with characters and tie-ins to her wildly successful YouTube series. And finally, in Home, our third quarter comp sales were down mid-single digits. Trends were relatively soft across the portfolio with bright spots in decorative accessories, led by fall newness, which grew comparable sales in the mid-teens and our affordable home refresh program with key partners like Hearth & Hand by Magnolia and Threshold by Studio McGee, both of which grew around 40% versus last year. And finally, because of our unique well-balanced assortment, we can move beyond a focus on driving performance within our merchandising categories and create innovation and excitement between them as well in ways that others simply can't.  As a perfect example, in Q3, we introduced powerhouse brands, Elf Cosmetics and Stanley. So guests can now match their favorite lip gloss color to their trendy drinkware. This innovative program is selling incredibly well and shows how we not only act on current trends but help to create new ones as well. As we turn the page to Q4, those cross-merchandising opportunities only grow more compelling. In just 2 days, the most anticipated theatrical release of the year hits theaters. Universal Studios Wicked opens Friday, and we are so excited to be the ultimate fan destination for this film. We're offering more than 150 movie-inspired items spanning apparel, toys, beauty, food, home and more. Nearly 70% of the items are available only at Target, including an apparel line created by the film's costume designer, Paul Tazewell. Our guests will be immersed in the magic of odds through Wicked theme store displays, shop-in-shops, digital experiences and other surprises throughout the season. And beyond the wow factor of this exclusive assortment, we brought the magic to our marketing campaign, featuring the film Star Cynthia Erivo, with a huge response from Target and Wicked fans alike on our social channels. Building on the theme of creating magical moments in the fourth quarter, our plans for this holiday season are designed to inspire, wonder and ah. And throughout the holiday season, we want to make sure we offer the perfect balance of value, newness, ease, and inspiration. Value will be on full display all season long from our everyday low prices to compelling promotions that help families celebrate the seasons, after an incredible response to our price reductions on 5,000 everyday items earlier this year, we reduced prices on an additional 2,000 items to drive traffic and help celebrate the holidays. We'll also be returning with some popular promotions like our Deal of the Day, which started on the first of this month and runs throughout the holiday season. And new this year, we recently held an early Black Friday sale just a couple of weeks ago. It's hard to believe that Thanksgiving is next week, and from Turkey to tabletop to core, we have everything families will need to gather together. This year, we're bringing back our popular Thanksgiving meal deal, now only $20 for a family of 4 which is $5 lower than last year. The meal includes Turkey at just $0.79 per pound as well as stuffing in 5 additional side dishes. Plus, we're offering a wide variety of hosting and gift-giving options including fresh flowers, wine, Good & Gather Charcuterie trays and on-trend housewares from owned brands like threshold and Figment, and while our stores are closed on Thanksgiving Day, helping our team members to celebrate with loved ones, will be back added on Black Friday to keep the holiday momentum going. And when you don't feel like cooking on the day after Thanksgiving, well, we'll be helping out by offering a free frozen pizza for our Target Circle 360 members. And speaking of the day after Thanksgiving, we recently announced 2 exclusive Taylor Swift releases available only at Target that we'll be launching only in stores on Black Friday before moving the assortment online the next day, while supplies last. The official Taylor Swift, the Eras Tour book provides a comprehensive behind-the-scenes view into the cultural phenomenon of Taylor Swift, the Eras Tour, including never before seen photos and personal reflections written by Taylor. In addition, we have exclusive versions of the Tortured Poets Department, The Anthology on both vinyl and CD, featuring 35 tracks, including 4 acoustic bonus songs. And while these exclusives are sure to be top on Swift's wish list, we have exciting gifting options for everyone in the family, all at unbeatable prices. More than half of our holiday toys are under $20 and thousands of stocking stuffers are under $5. But we know that consumers don't want to choose between value and newness. They want both. And at Target, they won't have to choose. Our holiday assortment is our biggest ever with 50% more new items compared to last year. These include exciting new toys from the biggest brands like Disney, LEGO and FAO Schwartz as well as our only target brand, GiggleScape. In beauty, we'll offer more than 100 new items, including incredible gift set options. This year's assortment is a great range of giftable items starting at just $5 with nearly 2/3 of this assortment priced under $10. In food, we'll be offering more than 700 new items in on-trend seasonal flavors, featuring new cookie and ginger bread kits for the whole family to enjoy building and eating. And again, this season, our partnership with British retailer, Marks & Spencer, will offer the best shortbread, candy and Christmas treats from across the pond, and for the first time, new home items like London themed ornaments and mugs all under $20. We've also worked to make shopping easier than ever this season. Of course, guests can rely on our industry-leading same-day services like order pickup, Drive Up and same-day delivery with Target Circle 360, but we're also making it easier to determine that perfect gift. With the new gift ideas page on our website and app, consumers can be inspired to find a perfect gift for that special someone, all on a set budget. And for those who want to make it clear what they're hoping to find under the tree this year, our digital holiday wish list feature removes the guess work for their loved ones. Plus our price match guarantee assures guests that no matter when and how they choose to shop, they'll get the best prices we have planned for the season. And like the bow on top of that perfect present, our marketing will tie it all together, immersing consumers in magic, imagination, and larger-than-life moments. Target guests will be transported to a land of iconic peppermint swirls and fantastical forest landscapes from in-store pop-up experiences to holiday TV and social spots that will leave them feeling festive, we want all families to have happier holidays, courtesy of their friends at Target. As I get ready to pass the baton over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams for the many ways they show up for this brand, for our guests, and for their communities. Every day, I am humbled by the talent and passion this team brings. And I am reminded of how special it is to work among world-class colleagues, retail leaders and friends. Thank you all for all you do to make Target, Target. With that, I'll pass the call over to Michael. Sure. I'd be happy to. And I'd start with apparel. We are pleased with our apparel performance, while it was slightly down in the third quarter, there are lots of bright spots. In particular, we are very excited about what we're seeing with performance, our all in motion brands delivering double-digit growth. We're excited about that. It's based on new fabrication, new colors, an outstanding price point at leggings at $25, bras at $16. And we're also seeing bright spot in women's apparel, both a new day in Wild Fable, our young contemporary brand, both of which are bringing new styles, new fashion, new colors, and we're seeing the consumer respond to that. And we expect that to continue. It's also worth noting when we saw the weather break in select markets, we saw a 600 basis point improvement. And that really bodes well for our apparel assortment as the weather gets colder consistently. And then if you think about some of our other discretionary categories, both Home and Hardlines, they're challenged from an industry perspective, and we're not happy with where we are. We want to get these businesses to growth. But what we would say is there are some bright spots. In particular, I would focus on home. When we deliver newness in home, we see the consumer respond. We're seeing that right now with some of our key partnerships, whether it's Hearth & Hand with Magnolia or its Threshold with Studio McGee. When we launched that fall newness, the consumer is responding. And so that is very encouraging for us. And then within Hardlines, that, like I said, is a challenge from an industry perspective. We don't see consumers buying big-ticket items like TVs. However, they are looking for affordable ways to freshen up their home. They're looking for ways to add a little bit of seasonal to core. So we see decorative accessories, things like frames, candles, vases performing really well, delivering growth, and that, we think, also bodes well as we go into the holidays, and we expect consumers to want to continue to refresh in their home with the new holiday decor. So as we look at the discretionary business, what we see is the consumer is willing to shop as long as it's new, it's on trend and at affordable price . I do think what differentiates Target is our multi-category business. And so as we go into the holiday season, you can get the turkey meal for $20 for a family of 4, but you can also get the tabletop decor. You can get the home decorations. And with our party shop, you can now get all of the apparel for those festifications through the season. So I do think that is something that really differentiates Target is our one-stop shop for everything that you need for the holiday season. Sure. I'll start with apparel. And kind of in short, how we think about apparel and how we think about the trends is really listening to the consumer, putting the consumer first. We have a really, really talented design team who are always looking at what is emerging, what's going to be relevant and what's going to resonate with the guests. . And right now, what we're seeing is newness, fashion, style, trend at a really compelling price. And it's that combination that is really working. Wild Fable is a perfect example of that, when we get those both right, the fashion plus the right price point, the right fabrication and colors, we see the consumer respond."

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks today by welcoming Jim Lee, to his first conference call as Target CFO. Jim recently joined our team from PepsiCo, where he gained a wealth of experience in numerous positions throughout their business. Since he arrived here in September,  Jim has been learning our business, and I've been incredibly impressed with his ability to synthesize large amounts of data, drill into what's most important, generate innovative solutions when presented with problems and then take quick action to address them. I'm confident you'll enjoy getting to know Jim in the quarters and years ahead, just as I have over the last several months. I also want to thank Michael for stepping up and occupying 2 important roles during the CFO search process. He did an incredible job leading both the finance and operations teams over the first half of the year. And I know both of those teams are grateful for his leadership. And of course, I want to thank the entire Target team for their leadership in successfully navigating through a difficult environment this quarter, a period that included a number of performance highlights and which also presented multiple challenges across our business. Because of our team's dedication to serving our guests and their focus on delivering newness and strong value, we saw healthy growth in traffic throughout the quarter even as we encountered some macro headwinds that caused our EPS to be lower than expected. Despite these headwinds, we're encouraged that operating income has grown 6.7% through the first 3 quarters of the year. We're highly confident in our proven long-term strategy and in our ability to move beyond this current volatility. And importantly, we're continuing to make the right investments in our business that will help us deliver profitable growth in the years ahead. Among the drivers of our comp sales, traffic grew a healthy 2.4% this quarter, representing well over 10 million incremental transactions compared with last year. This growth in traffic was mostly offset by a decline in average ticket as consumers continue to spend cautiously, most notably in discretionary categories. Overall, our third quarter comp sales increased 0.3%, near the bottom of our expected range. As you know, we focus on traffic as a key indicator of guest engagement and the growth we've been seeing is a validation of our guest-focused strategies and our team's commitment to delivering newness, value and a differentiated experience. We continue to measure year-over-year increases in guest service scores, and we're really pleased with the response to thousands of price reductions we introduced earlier this year, which we're extending with another 2,000 more as we enter the holiday season. We've also seen strong results in the digital channel, which grew by nearly 11% this quarter. Among our digital services, we saw nearly 20% growth in our same-day delivery, powered by Target Circle 360, as more guests learned about it and respond to the value and convenience this service offers. We also saw double-digit growth in Drive Up this quarter, which accounted for more than $2 billion in our Q3 sales. We also saw healthy growth in our ship-to-home business in Q3, as guests responded to the changes we made to streamline the shopping experience, increased speed and reliability and lower our costs by moving more of our shipments through sortation centers. At the category level, we've seen persistent strength in beauty, which saw a comp increase of more than 6% in the quarter, while our frequency businesses delivered solid growth in both traffic and sales. And we're pleased with our relative performance first to the market in apparel, even with a small sales decline in an environment where we saw slow sales of cold weather apparel across the industry. Our other 2 discretionary businesses, Home and Hardlines saw continued softness in Q3 as consumers continue to spend cautiously in these categories. When we assess the consumer and macro environment, we're seeing many of the same themes that have defined the environment for some time. Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched and they're shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation. They're becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them. As a result, we're seeing a strong response to promotions than we've seen in some time. Yet consumers are still willing to spend when they find the right combination of newness and value and they're continuing to celebrate important seasonal moments throughout the year. Because they worked hard to control their day-to-day spending, consumers sometimes allow them sells to splurge a little bit when they find the right item or the right seasonal moment arrives. As Michael will highlight in more detail, our supply chain faced some unique challenges related to the East Coast and Gulf port strikes. In order to protect our in-stocks and ensure we're ready for Q4, our team changed the timing of certain shipments and directed a portion of our receipts to other ports. Receipt timing changes and the impact of softer-than-expected sales in discretionary categories, resulted in elevated levels of inventory earlier than in a typical year, leading to higher-than-expected costs in our supply chain. While we weren't pleased with this cost pressure, we are confident we took the right steps to safeguard our reliability, as our team's decisive actions protected Q3 in stocks while supporting our Q4 merchandising plans. Beyond the headwinds in our supply chain, we also faced some unexpected pressure in health care and general liability expenses this quarter, which Jim will outline in a few minutes. Another Q3 highlight was our most recent Target Circle week in early October. Guests are responding to the changes we've incorporated into this program, and they appreciate the value it provides at every level. We enrolled nearly 3 million new Target Circle members this quarter, and we'll continue making long-term investments in this loyalty program with a focus on reaching new members, and driving incremental engagement among our existing base. Beyond the profitable traffic and sales we see from Targeted Circle, this program also helps us learn more about our guests and their preferences, which in turn helps to fuel our Roundel ad business.  Roundel delivered mid-teen growth in Q3, benefiting both our total revenue and gross margin rate, while driving deeper connections among our guests, the Target brand and our vendors. In a few minutes, Rick will highlight our merchandising and marketing plans for the holiday season. And while we're really excited about them, we're also focused on controlling what we can control and planning the business cautiously, given the volatility we've been seeing. While we aren't happy about the reduction in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe we're managing our business appropriately, and we're helping our teams stay agile and ready to respond if we see our business accelerate. And our Q4 plan is focused on ending this year with an inventory position that will best position our business going into 2025. Importantly, we're still confident in our long-term strategy. Traffic growth shows that we're winning with our guests, and we're making the long-term investments that have delivered strong performance over decades. This includes capital investments in our existing stores in full remodels, smaller refreshes, and layout changes to increase the efficiency of our same-day services. We're investing in our digital experience and our website, app and our full menu of fulfillment capabilities to become even more reliable and convenient for our guests. We're investing in our new store program based on strong performance of this year's openings and a robust pipeline of new locations planned for 2025. We're making smart investments in technology, including AI, to allow our team to do more for our guests more quickly. We're investing in our own brand portfolio, which delivers a unique combination of style and value that differentiates our assortment from everyone else in the marketplace. We're delivering value through our investments in lower everyday prices and the deals we offer to our Target Circle members, and the compelling promotions we will deliver throughout the holiday season, and we're continuing to invest in our team to ensure they can deliver a differentiated, joyful target guest experience across every channel, every day throughout the year. With Thanksgiving right around the corner, I want to pause and acknowledge the efforts of my fellow team members, most notably in our stores and supply chain facilities. We've been spending months preparing for our busiest season of the year. Throughout the company, our team members bring enormous energy to their work. But in the fourth quarter, they shift into an even higher gear. I want to thank them for everything they do to make Target, Target. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick. Thanks, Jim. Before we move to your questions, I want to pick up on a couple of thoughts Jim provided in his remarks, namely, I want to highlight the assets and the strategy underlying our business model, and how we can leverage those assets to deliver on the long-term financial goals Michael shared at our Financial Community Meeting back in March. We often highlight how we work to differentiate our merchandising offering and shopping experience from others in the marketplace. In pursuit of that goal, we invest in differentiated assets across our business. These include the locations where we build our stores, our unparalleled design and sourcing capabilities, our huge own brand portfolio, best-in-class national brands and partnerships, an advertising business that far outpunches its weight and a rapidly growing online marketplace and Target Plus. We also have one of the largest loyalty programs in America, which includes a large and valuable payment card program and a nationwide same-day delivery service. In support of these capabilities, we have made significant investments to build the best team in retail, across our stores, supply chain and headquarters, all of whom are aligned behind our brand. We put these assets to work through a differentiated strategy that includes our unique storage and sub model, a curated merchandising approach that spans both wants and needs and a fulfillment offering that highlights speed and convenience, while leaning into the power of genuine human interaction. Those are combined with a singular focus on value that includes low prices and compelling deals, combined with an elevated assortment and experience. So even as we encounter short-term headwinds, like we've seen recently, we immediately focus on leveraging our assets and strategy to move beyond those challenges. For example,  while we're confident that discretionary demand will normalize over time, we can continue to lean on our beauty and frequency categories to help offset those top line pressures, just as we have over the last couple of years. And when we begin to see unexpected cost pressures like we've encountered recently, we look for ways to leverage growth in Roundel and our ongoing efficiency work to help offset those pressures. But it all starts with the consumer, focusing on our guests and building deeper engagement with them serves as the underlying foundation of our work to build a profitable and sustainable business and deliver for our shareholders over time. I'd point out our Q3 traffic growth of 2.4%, representing more than 10 million additional transactions compared with last year as evidence of that focus. As we sit here today,  we're confident we have the right assets, the right strategy and the right team in place to attain our strategic and financial goals. As always, we appreciate your engagement and your participation in this call, and look forward to sharing our progress with you over time. With that, we'll turn to your questions. Now Rick, Michael, Jim and I will be happy to take your questions. Michael, do you want to start? Jim, anything else you want to add? . Yes. Simeon, well, we certainly have to embrace some of the short-term macro challenges. You've heard us say this for years, we're going to play the long game and make sure we're doing the right thing for the long-term interest of our company and shareholders, and even in a difficult Q3 environment, one of the things we've highlighted is the strength in traffic, up 2.4%, that equates to 10 million incremental transactions during the quarter. So we feel really good about the fact that consumers are choosing target, whether it's in-store or online. We feel really good about the expansion of our digital performance, and that bodes well for the short term. But certainly, long term, we're going to continue to lean into our digital assets. So seeing digital grow by almost 11% is really encouraging. We've talked about the importance of our Target Circle 360 delivery to home program, and that grew at almost 20%, and we'll continue to make sure we're investing in building awareness around that unique capability. Drive Up continues to be a point differentiate for us and again saw double-digit growth, and it's a really important part of our digital offering. So while there's some unique short-term headwinds we're facing, we're going to play the long game, continue to invest in value and newness. And we saw some bright spots even in discretionary categories. Michael and Rick have both talked about the deceleration we saw in apparel. But we continue to take share in those categories. And even within apparel, there's some real bright spots. We think about how we're performing with all in motion and the apparel performance category, growing double digits, taking share in that very important category, both short term and long term. So we'll continue to make sure we're investing in newness, investing in value, investing in our stores and digital channel and playing the long game. And I think there's a number of green shoots in front of us that we're going to continue to leverage in the fourth quarter, but certainly in the 2025 and beyond. Rick you want to spend some time talking about what we're seeing in some of our big discretionary categories? Rupesh, I would only add a couple of points, as we think about 2025, those discretionary categories will continue to represent upwards of 50% of our business. As Rick just discussed, we'll continue to lean into innovation and newness and value, and we've got to make sure we don't get ahead of the consumer and ahead of the macro trends. So we'll plan appropriately. We'll plan cautiously. We'll look for green shoots and will follow trends, but we've got to make sure we're staying in step with the consumer. Kate, it is a trend we've seen for quite some time now. And I think over the last couple of years, we've talked about a very resilient consumer. I think sitting here today, we'll change it to a resourceful consumer. And I think as we look at shopping behavior and certainly behavior we've seen in Q3, and we expect to see going into Q4, we know that consumers are looking for value, they are looking for promos and deals when they're shopping for those everyday essentials. And they're shopping carefully and taking some of those savings to find those unique items in discretionary categories that they really want. We think that's going to continue. So we're going to make sure that we're leaning into the right value throughout the holiday season, bundling that newness with great value and recognizing that we got to make sure we're staying again in step with that consumer, providing the value, the uniqueness that they're looking for when they shop Target. That's a trend that I think we are going to see in the fourth quarter, and we'll certainly see some of that continue in 2025. Michael, I'm happy to start and then invite Michael and Jim and Rick to add their perspective. But I think we've got to continue to make sure Target is being Target. And we're using our unique mix of great national brands, our strength in own brands, those unique partnerships. Rick talked about an exciting partnership that will come to life on Black Friday, partnering with Taylor Swift, which will be a traffic driver for our business during an important holiday period. But we're going to continue to invest in our stores, Michael talked about, we're really encouraged with some of the new stores we've opened in 2024. We've had a big pipeline over the next 10 years. We know expanding our footprint is going to be important. We'll continue to lean into our digital assets, and we saw some great proof points in Q3. We've got to continue to build out our digital assets, whether it's pickup or drive up or delivery to home, we'll continue to lean into those spaces. So we're going to continue to make sure we're delivering the delight and the joy consumers are looking for, they expect from us, whether they're shopping our stores, visiting our sites. We'll continue to deepen our partnerships with national brand partners, accelerate our own brand portfolio, and constantly look for those new partnerships that drive traffic and engagement in our brand. We'll continue to lean into our Circle program, and we talked about in Q3 alone, we had another 3 million members, that's an important way for us to continue to deepen our engagement. We're very pleased with the work we're doing on the retail media side, and Roundel has become a critical asset for us. and we saw again mid-teen growth in the third quarter. We'll continue to deliver in that space for years to come. So we'll continue on our current strategy, stay in step with the consumer and make sure Target is doing the things that consumers across America expect from us. And while I know Jim is still new to Target, I'd love to get his early perspective. Michael, I thought you did a terrific job on CNBC this morning, kind of talking about the state of the state, and we've already spent a lot of time today talking about some of the macro headwinds we're facing in discretionary categories. We know over time, those trends will reverse. And it's still going to be really important that we're a destination for apparel and provide great design and style and on-trend apparel. We know the home category will rebound over time. We know America is going to buy sporting goods and toys. So there's some macro short-term headwinds that we've got to embrace and understand. But long term, we think the strength of our business model, our multi-category portfolio, that unique blend of national brands and own brands, the strength we have in both a great physical experience and a digital experience, those are going to be the hallmarks of Target going forward, and we've got to make sure we're focused on the long term and leaning into the things that American consumers expect from Target. Michael, we certainly see upside in the future and some of the macro trends change. But sitting here today, we're leaning into the things that consumers want. And Rick talked about some of the strength in our food and beverage business, the strength in essentials, the strength in beauty. We want to make sure we're continuing to lean into those trends and consistently growing the top line, improving our share position, we're going to make sure that we're ready for these big seasonal moments. And despite some of the macro headwinds we've seen really for 8 or 9 quarters in discretionary categories, we continue to see a consumer who's shopping for those seasonal moments and whether it's celebrating Mother's Day or Fourth of July, getting ready for Halloween, that Thanksgiving meal and the Christmas season, we know those are still really important moments for consumers. Those are Target moments, and we're going to make sure we lean in and win. So we're certainly looking for an improvement in our performance over time. We're not pleased where we are today, but we see a lot of green shoots and a lot of long-term opportunities to continue to advance our business, a destination for consumers who are shopping our stores or visiting our online assets and continue to be that place where consumers come for that magical Target experience where we bring those great national brands, our great own brands, and those unique partnerships that you can only find at Target. Karen, I'll let Rick talk about apparel, let Michael talk about inventory. And we'll let Jim talk about our CapEx and think about the coming year. Rick, do you want to start with apparel? . Jim? Operator, I know we're running a little long, but why don't we take 1 last question today. Operator, that concludes our third quarter call. I appreciate everyone joining us, and wish you a happy holiday. We'll see you in 2025."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, Rick. The fourth quarter is here. And in short, we are ready. While some consumers are already done with their holiday shopping,  some are waiting for those major promotional events like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, and others won't start thinking about their Christmas list until the last minute. And across the operations team, we've been forming our plans, securing inventory, assessing the external environment and preparing for the season for months now. As you heard already from both Brian and Rick, macro headwinds and increased volatility throughout the third quarter, both expected and unexpected, resulted in financial and operational challenges for our business. But despite these challenges, because of all the effort our team has put into the planning, we feel great about our ability to serve guests this holiday season. Beyond the normal considerations of running a large retail business, unusual weather patterns, port strikes and overseas port delays added to the complexities of the quarter. This year's hurricane season has been particularly devastating for so many communities. While we're grateful that our team members in affected areas are safe, we also know that the damage from Hurricanes Helene and Milton has been vast and impacted communities are still recovering. In advance of the storm, we closed dozens of stores and a few supply chain facilities to keep our guests and team members safe. After the storms passed, we carefully assessed each location and we're able to reopen nearly all of our facilities within 24 hours. these storms as well as unseasonably warm weather throughout the quarter, created higher spikes and lower troughs than would otherwise be expected, displaying the resilience of our supply chain in advance of peak holiday volume this quarter. We also successfully navigated the challenges presented by the port disruptions on the East Coast and Gulf ports. We have been closely monitoring the situation for months, in anticipation of a potential strike, our team took decisive action to route select shipments to West Coast ports to protect key seasonal programs for the fourth quarter. This came at a cost, but allowed us to be well positioned for our guests through the strike and into the holiday season. Thankfully, the strike was short-lived. We'll continue to watch the situation closely in the lead up to continued negotiations in January. We also saw higher-than-expected volatility in receipt timing in some Asian ports early in the quarter. Collectively, the impacts from the port strikes and receipt timing volatility drove additional costs in the quarter. Fortunately, our teams were able to navigate this volatility incredibly well. So our inventory position and operations are well prepared for the holiday season. One quick final note on inventory. Third quarter ending inventory on our balance sheet was about 3% higher than a year ago. That said, as we've done before, we often compare back to 2019 as a useful way to look beyond the volatility we've seen in our business over the last 5 years. And by that comparison, you'll see that our Q3 sales this year versus 2019 have grown slightly faster than ending inventory over the same period. I'd like to take a minute to thank those teams throughout our stores and supply chain at headquarters and around the world for managing through each of these challenges head on. Their care and commitment to each other and to serving our guests regardless of the trials at hand, makes me incredibly proud of this team, and it's the incredible work of this team that has us ready to delight our guests this season, with the type of amazing holiday experience you can only find at Target. Thank you, Team Target, for all you do to show up for this brand and for our communities day in and day out. As you've heard me share on these calls for a while now, we remain laser-focused on our retail fundamentals with the goal of continuing to improve our level of service for consumers. High on that list is our focus on being consistently in stock for our guests, when, where, and how they want to shop. And once again this quarter, our in-stock position improved meaningfully from already strong results a year ago. But as I mentioned before, in stocks are only 1 way to measure inventory reliability. If we have inventory on the shelf, that product is considered in stock, but that might not be enough depth to support the combination of in-store and digital demand. As such, we also track a metric we call purchasability which helps us protect our guests in-store and digital shopping experiences. Here's an example. If stock in an item begins to run low, we may choose to make the item temporarily unpurchaseable for same-day fulfillment in order to protect the in-store shopping experience. The team has been working hard to reduce the number of times this happens, and we're encouraged that consistent with our in-stock trends, we've significantly improved our purchasability metrics year-over-year. But to be clear, for both in-stocks and purchasability, we won't mistake progress for potential and we're hard at work to continue improving inventory reliability for our guests. Beyond making sure our inventory is in the right place, we also want to make sure our new stores are ideally located as well. Already, 3 out of 4 Americans live within 10 miles of a Target store, and our properties team constantly monitors population and migration trends to determine where a new location might best serve a growing community. This year, that work helped us secure locations for 23 new stores, 13 of which just opened this past quarter from Miami, Florida to El Monte, California, to Waukee in my home state of Iowa, thousands of consumers will newly experience the joy of having a target in their own backyards. And clearly, our guests in these neighborhoods are responding as this portfolio of new stores is performing ahead of our expectations. In addition to new stores, we're also investing in our existing store fleet from the work we've done to enhance our front of store experience to the investments we've made to find the top talent in the markets where we operate, we're relentless in our pursuit of making sure that our stores provide a joyful, convenient and efficient shopping experience. And while there is always room to improve by nearly every measure we track, our extensive survey data indicates we are making meaningful progress. More specifically, Net Promoter Scores for wait times at checkout lanes, satisfaction with team member interactions at both checkout and while shopping, ability to find products and the cleanliness of our stores are all up year-over-year. And of course, we're making investments in our digital business as well. And the name of the game here is speed across all types of digital fulfillment. In ship-to-home fulfillment with stores close to our guests and our sortation centers handling 25% more packages than last year, we're faster than ever, shipping packages to guest homes, helping power the healthy sales growth we're seeing in our Ship to Home business. In fact, as of the third quarter, average shipping times across our network are nearly a day faster than this time a year ago. We've also implemented changes to reduce split shipments, driving an increase in units fulfilled per package, eliminating a source of friction for our guests and reducing last mile delivery costs as well. Altogether, our sortation centers have saved the company tens of millions of dollars in last mile delivery costs so far this year when compared to other fulfillment options. And when it comes to speed, there's nothing faster than our same-day services, which is why we continue to rely on guest feedback to build upon these already loved services, making them even better. This year, our target app became available for use in Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, making us the first retailer to offer guests the ability to navigate to a store for a curbside order using these phone-based technologies. In addition, based on feedback we've received from our guests, we recently rolled out the ability to opt out of plastic bags for drive-up and in-store pickup orders. This not only allows us to better serve these guest preferences, it has also helped save the cost of millions of plastic bags. And finally, beyond the investments we've made in drive-up and in-store pickup, we've also been investing heavily in our same-day delivery capabilities through Target Circle 360. Since the relaunch of Target Circle in April, we've seen a meaningful increase in the number of Target Circle 360 memberships, and thanks to the incredible efforts of our partners at shipped, we are not only able to meet the rapid growth in demand, we've maintained the already high Net Promoter Scores this offering consistently generates. And of course, beyond same-day shopping, our shipped powered capabilities play a critical role in helping us deliver packages from sortation centers more quickly and less expensively than through alternative carriers. Before I pass things off to Jim, I'd like to echo Brian, and welcome him to his first earnings call. As Jim and I have worked together through the first few months of his onboarding process, I've already seen what a curious, compassionate and strategic leader he is, and I couldn't be happier to have him on the Target team. I'll continue to work closely with Jim as he ramps up in leading our finance function, and I'm excited to see what that team will accomplish under Jim's guidance and leadership. With that, I'll pass the call over to Jim. Yes, I'd be happy to. Thanks for the question, Simeon. If you step back and look at the profit outcomes in Q3 and what's on our mind as we guide for Q4, and Jim summarized a lot of it in his remarks. I'd start with, we saw a deceleration in a couple of our highest margin categories. So home and apparel, both decelerated about 4 percentage points from Q2. And so the profit impact of the softer-than-expected sales we certainly felt in Q3, and we believe we've got the business guided appropriately cautiously in those categories as we think to Q4, and we're committed to ending the year clean from an inventory perspective. You click further down the list. I mentioned in my remarks, we had some additional costs as we prepositioned some inventory in advance of preparing for the port strike, that's obviously unique to this year thing. We feel like it was the right decision, ensure we're in stock in a situation that we were monitoring closely, and we were pleased with how that played out from a guest experience perspective. And then Jim also mentioned a few unique things on the SG&A side. And while I have a ton of confidence in the team's ability to find efficiencies to offset some of those headwinds over time, that's not always appropriate or prudent to do within a month or a quarter. You can do some shortsighted things if you pull the wrong levers too quickly there. But given this team's track record of building back profitability over time, I have a lot of confidence we'll find the right efficiencies for us. Yes, I'm happy to build just a little bit on that. You've heard us say before, Michael, we've got a consumer, our guests who likes to shop, and I'll remind everyone that we round to maybe a 3 share in the categories in which we compete. So we see a lot of runway for growth over time, and we're excited about the foundation we're building now in support of that. Brian touched on a few of the things, but maybe just to double-click into the strength of the digital business that we saw in the quarter. Digital up almost 11%, real strength around some intentional work the team did to relaunch Circle with the Circle 360 program to see same-day delivery growing by 20%. And I remind everyone that that's a really important investment in the long term. We know when we make it easy to shop Target in all those different ways, guest will reward us with more spend at Target over time. And so that increased spend in total, that increase spend even in store that comes when a guest becomes a Circle 360 member that uses the same-day delivery. We're really excited about some of the foundation that we're building for the long term. You can see it in the digital growth and the way that will pay off over time, you can see it in the traffic numbers, and so we're managing the short term appropriately, but making the right investments for the long term. On the inventory side, Karen, we've touched a little bit on this already. But if you look at the balance sheet, we're up about 3% year-over-year as we closed the quarter. And we feel good that we're well positioned to be in stock across the balance of the holiday season. If you walk through the front doors of a Target store right now or see us online, it's great to see an excellent trim set. It's great to see the newness in apparel. And so we think we're well positioned for the holidays. It's also important that we finish the year clean from an inventory perspective, and we feel really good that we've got the fourth quarter guided in a position that allows us to accomplish that goal. Yes. Thanks for the question, Robbie. I'll kind of go back a little bit to my answer to Simeon's question. If you think about the big factors in Q3 and the things that are on our mind as we guide for the fourth quarter, it's being appropriately cautious based on the trends we've seen in the discretionary categories. And some of that deceleration shows up the profit outcomes in Q3 and factors into our guide for Q4. Apparel and home are high-margin category, isn't to see them decelerate like they did that factors into our profit outcomes and our guidance and important, we want to end the year clean in both of those categories. As you click further down the P&L, there were some things that were certainly more unique due to factors this year, like moving inventory around the port strike, and we feel good that we're on the other side of that now, and then further down the P&L on the expense side, we saw some expenses creep up versus the trends that they had, had prior to what we've seen earlier in the year, and we'll work to manage through those over time. And like I said, progress the team has made in efficiency work over time gives me a lot of confidence that we'll be able to work to build back against that. But it all starts with the top line, the investments we're making in the top line. And even your last question on the Circle 360 launch, I think, is a great may be place to bridge to because we're really excited with the guest response we've seen in Circl360. It's great to see us add 3 million new members to Circle in total.  it's great to see same-day delivery growing at almost 20% in the quarter. And we think those are all things that are quite accretive to the top line and the bottom line over time."

            "content": "Thanks, Michael. I've long admired the Target brand and its differentiated positioning with American Retail. And since I've arrived here, I've enjoyed getting to know the Target team and gain a much deeper understanding of our business. I've also developed a greater appreciation for the company's long-term strategic advantages, including our unique stores as hub model that Target pioneered nearly a decade ago, a large, profitable and growing own brand portfolio coupled with an outstanding collection of national brands and unique partnerships. A robust business model that includes strong retail operations and a broad footprint of capabilities, including Target Circle, Roundel and our third-party marketplace, Target Plus, and a strong culture behind a capable team that's passionate about our brand and committed to caring, growing and winning together. Having gained deeper insights into these assets, I'm even more excited about our potential to deliver sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead. Turning to our third quarter financial results. Our comparable sales increase of 0.3% was near the low end of our expected range, while EPS came in below expectations due to soft discretionary trends and multiple cost headwinds, some of which were unique to the quarter. Among the drivers of our comparable sales, healthy guest traffic growth of 2.4% was largely offset by a 2% decline in average ticket. This decline was driven primarily by softness in our discretionary categories, where consumers are shopping cautiously as they manage their household budgets. Within the quarter, monthly comps were strongest in October as guests responded to our Target Circle week promotions and we saw sequential improvement in discretionary categories. While store comparable sales were down 1.9%, we were pleased with our digital comp growth of 10.8%. Within digital, same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360, increased nearly 20%. We also saw double-digit growth in Drive-Up and a healthy increase in ship to home volume. On the other revenue line, we saw growth of 11.5% in the quarter, driven primarily by continued rapid growth in our Roundel ad business. Our operating margin rate of 4.6% was down about 60 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the combined impact of softer-than-expected sales in our highest margin categories, and cost pressures on both the gross margin and SG&A expense lines. Overall, our gross margin rate was about 20 basis points lower than last year. Among the drivers,  we saw about 90 basis points of pressure from digital fulfillment and supply chain costs resulting from multiple factors, including the incremental supply chain costs that Michael outlined earlier and the impact of double-digit growth in digital sales. Offsetting this pressure, we saw about 50 basis points of financial benefit related to inventory shrink and about 20 basis points of benefit in merchandising. One note,  the gross margin rate impact of merchandise mix was approximately flat in Q3, down from a 40 basis point benefit in Q2. This change was driven primarily by a slowdown in our highest-margin discretionary categories, apparel and home, whose comp trends both decelerated about 4 percentage points when compared with Q2. Our SG&A expense rate increased about 50 basis points in the third quarter, reflecting multiple cost pressures, some of which were unexpected, combined with top line sales near the low end of our expected range. Among the most notable drivers, we saw higher-than-expected general liability costs, a trend that's occurring more broadly and higher-than-expected health care costs as well. Altogether, our Q3 GAAP and adjusted EPS was $1.85 compared with $2.10 a year ago. Year-to-date, both GAAP and adjusted EPS have increased 8.3% compared with last year. As I turn now to cash flow and capital deployment, I want to reiterate our priorities, which have been consistent for decades and remain firmly in place today. We first look to invest fully in the business in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of growing the dividend annually, something we've done since 1971. And finally, we look to return any excess cash beyond those first 2 uses by repurchasing shares over time within the constraints of our middle A credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we've invested just under $2 billion in CapEx year-to-date, and with updated project timing, we expect our full year CapEx will be near the low end of our guidance range for the year at $3 billion or slightly lower. As Brian mentioned, we have a robust pipeline of new stores and remodels, along with supply chain and technology projects that we expect will generate strong returns over time. Based on expected project timing, we're anticipating 2025 CapEx will range between $4 billion and $5 billion, near the middle of the long-run expectation Michael outlined earlier this year. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $516 million in the third quarter, up from $507 million a year ago. And finally, we deployed $354 million to retire about 2.4 million of our shares in Q3. Given our cash position and our expectations going forward, we expect to continue repurchasing shares in Q4 as well.  Following my commentary on the quarter with some comments on after-tax ROIC, which measures the quality of our capital investments over time. In the third quarter, our trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC was 15.9%, 2 percentage points higher than a year ago. While a mid-teens after-tax return is quite strong, our long-term plans anticipate further expansion of this metric into the high teens over time. Now I want to move to our expectations for Q4. As Brian mentioned, we're focused on planning the business cautiously based on the volatility we've encountered so far this year. Our expectations also reflect some unique attributes of this year's calendar including the loss of 5 shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and the shift in this year's fiscal calendar after last year's 53rd week. While these calendar impacts are difficult to isolate, we estimate they could amount to nearly 1 percentage point headwind to our fourth quarter comps. In addition, as we outlined a year ago, last year's 53rd week contributed about $1.7 billion to our total sales and an estimated $200 million to our operating income. Note that the extra week did not affect last year's reported comp sales as they're based on periods of equaling. With all that as context, I'll turn to our updated guidance. On the top line, we're anticipating fourth quarter comparable sales in a range around flat reflecting continued softness in discretionary categories and the calendar headwinds I mentioned earlier. If we end up near the middle of that Q4 range, it would translate to a slightly negative comp for the full year. On the bottom line, our expectations reflect this updated view of comparable sales, updated SG&A expectations, including ongoing cost pressures and our commitment to ending the quarter in an appropriate inventory position for the new fiscal year. Consistent with our prior guidance, we believe the P&L impact of inventory shrink will be approximately flat in Q4, and we expect to continue to benefit from our ongoing efficiency work. Altogether, our updated range for the fourth quarter, GAAP and adjusted EPS is $1.85 to $2.45, translating to an updated full year range of $8.30 to $8.90 a share. This new full year range brackets the lower end of our initial guidance back in March in light of the sales and profit headwinds that have emerged in the back end of this year. Having outperformed our profit expectations through Q2 it's disappointing that a deceleration in discretionary demand, combined with multiple cost pressures have caused us to take down our guidance after raising it last quarter. Given ongoing consumer uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to take this conservative approach while taking swift and disciplined action to position ourselves to win during the holidays and in 2025. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of our business, given the strength of our strategy, the assets we have in place and the investment projects in our pipeline. While current conditions are quite challenging, we're confident that demand in discretionary categories will normalize, and our team has shown they can find efficiencies to help offset the cost pressures we're facing. As Michael shared earlier this year, this company generated strong financial performance over the last decade, and I believe we can generate compelling top and bottom line growth in the decade ahead. As I said earlier, since I joined the team, I've become even more excited about our prospects, and I look forward to sharing our progress in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian for some closing remarks. Brian? Yes. I mean specifically on the SG&A line, we mentioned general liability and health care costs. You can dimensionalize that as approximately 1% of the increase in SG&A that you saw in the quarter. . Yes. I mean, Michael, it's a great question. I mean I think just 2 months in, it's clear to me that making sure that we are unique, and we are Target, being Target. That's important for how we think about our business and even just to extend it to our third-party marketplace Target Plus.  We carefully carried our partners to make sure that we're on brand as we think about growth in that category and that business model. So it's important for us to ensure we stay on brand. . And then on CapEx, as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll close this year at about $3 billion or slightly lower than that. And then looking out to 2025, as we look at our pipeline of new stores and remodels and technology and supply chain investments, we're anchoring at about $4 billion to $5 billion of CapEx for 2025."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you to participate in a question-and-answer session. At the close of prepared remarks, we will open the queue for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 21, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Gomez, Chief Commercial Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Rick, and Michael will provide their insights on our second quarter performance along with our outlook and priorities for the third quarter and remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who will be listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions. And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. Also, in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our investor relations website. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the second quarter and his priorities for the third quarter and beyond. Brian?\nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my remarks today by welcoming Rick Gomez to this call, following his recent move into the role of Chief Commercial Officer. This change was one of several we announced in June, including Christina Hennington's move into the role of Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, and Lisa Roath's transition into the role of Chief Merchandising Officer of Food, Essentials, and Beauty. Lisa has done a fantastic job leading our marketing team, and I've asked her to remain in that role until early 2025. This will provide adequate time for us to complete an external search for her successor, before Lisa brings her impressive commercial leadership experience back into the merchandising team. These changes follow our January announcement that Michael would move into the pivotal role of our Chief Operating Officer. Michael took on the CFO role just before the pandemic, and he's done an outstanding job leading the company through a period of unprecedented growth and volatility. The search for Michael's replacement as CFO is ongoing, and I share Michael's excitement for the time when he's able to fully focus on his new role leading all of our operational functions. And, of course, we were pleased this month to welcome Amy Tu into the role of Chief Legal and Compliance Officer. During her career, Amy has served in key leadership roles for several Fortune 100 companies, and I'm excited to welcome her to the Target team. Amy is taking the place of Don Liu on our team as he prepares for his retirement. I want to pause and thank Don for his many years of thoughtful and conscientious service to Target and our stakeholders. He is an outstanding leader who has served as a trusted partner to me, to our Board, and our entire leadership team during his tenure here at Target. All of these changes in our team are just the latest evidence of our focus on developing enterprise leaders, ones who go well beyond subject matter expertise to develop strong leadership skills with a foundation based on a comprehensive understanding of our business and how we fit into the broader landscape. And as you've seen from our second quarter results, the strength of our entire team was clearly evident in our financial performance, which came in well above our expectations. On the top line, we met our goal of returning to growth, but moved well beyond that baseline expectation. More specifically, our Q2 comparable sales grew 2%, at the very top end of our guidance range. And on the bottom line for the quarter, our EPS of $2.57 was well above the high end of our guidance, representing growth of more than 42% over last year. Among the drivers of our comp sales, we're pleased that our second quarter growth was driven entirely by traffic, reflecting the combined benefits of the multiple guest-focused initiatives we outlined in our Financial Community Meeting back in March. It's also notable that our store and digital channels both saw growth in Q2. Our digital team has done an outstanding job of enhancing our digital experience and that's showing through in our business results. We saw high single-digit growth in our digital comps in Q2 and even faster growth in same-day services led by Drive Up and Target Circle 360, both of which grew in the low teens. Same-day services now account for more than two-thirds of our digital sales with the biggest contribution from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in Q2 and more than $4 billion so far this year. Our balanced, multi-category merchandising assortment continues to resonate with our guests as trends strengthened across the board in Q2. And we were particularly encouraged to see discretionary category trends improve for the fourth consecutive quarter. In apparel, comp sales grew by more than 3%, marking an improvement of more than 5 percentage points when compared with the first quarter. Our apparel team has done a fantastic job of incorporating great design, newness, and value throughout their assortment, most notably in our All in Motion brand, which delivered growth in the low teens. Beauty was another standout as the category continued to gain share with comp growth of 9% in Q2, on top of double-digit growth a year ago. On the frequency side of our assortment, both our food and beverage, and essential categories saw traffic growth in the quarter as consumers are responding to our offerings in an environment where they're focused on value. Over the summer, we reduced our prices on about 5,000 frequently purchased items in many markets and we saw an acceleration in both our unit and dollar sales trends in these businesses. We're also seeing continued momentum in our Target Circle loyalty platform following its relaunch in the first quarter. With over 100 million members, we're always happy to welcome new guests who choose to join and we added more than 2 million new members in the second quarter. But our aspirations go well beyond growing our membership base. We redesigned Target Circle with the goal of increasing engagement among existing members and we've already realized the benefits. For example, during our July Target Circle week, about two-thirds of our transactions were made by Target Circle members. Beyond the direct benefit of guest engagement with the platform, Target Circle also helps us gain deep consumer insights, allowing us to extend more personal, customized offers through our Roundel advertising business. Roundel continues to experience rapid growth, based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors. In the second quarter, Roundel delivered double-digit growth to the benefit of both gross margin and the other revenue line of our P&L. For the full year, Roundel is expected to grow in the high teens, on top of more than 20% growth in 2023. As we continue to survey consumers and monitor the external environment, our view remains largely the same, as we've been sharing for some time. Consumers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of multiple challenges over the last several years, and they remain resilient today. Given the significant headwinds they have faced with inflation over the last few years, consumers continue to focus on value as they work hard to manage their household budgets. And while they continue to turn out and shop around holidays and other seasonal moments, many are delaying purchases until the moment of need. Against that backdrop, our team continues to focus on providing unbeatable value for our guests. And of course, that starts with a focus on low everyday prices, including our recent price reductions on frequently purchased items. But our focus on value only begins with low prices. Whether we're highlighting compelling deals for our Target Circle members, offering an additional 5% savings to our Target Circle cardholders, designing and sourcing high quality owned brands at compelling prices, or delivering ease and convenience with Drive Up and Target Circle 360, our team is continually working to find more ways to deliver more value for our guests. As we look ahead, Our team is focused on controlling what we can control. We're committed to staying on offense while maintaining an overall cautious outlook, a stance that has worked well for us over the last few quarters. Throughout the company, we're focused on retail fundamentals and strong execution. This includes our commitment to being in stock and reliable, even as we maintain a prudent inventory position. It also includes our focus on delivering speed and convenience in every fulfillment channel, while providing efficient and friendly service to our guests in every store every day. We're also looking to build on the momentum we've been seeing in discretionary categories, where trends have already improved significantly, and we see much more opportunity ahead of us. We're focused on continued expansion of our operating margin rate as we move back towards and potentially beyond the 6% annual rate we were earning before the pandemic. We're committed to continued disciplined capital deployment. Following more than a year of hard work to strengthen our balance sheet, we were pleased to get back to share our purchases in the second quarter and we expect to have continued capacity within our middle A ratings in Q3 and beyond. And of course, we're focused on continued investment in our team, in their training, development, pay, and benefits. To support our team, we're making smart investments in AI technology to make their work easier and more productive, enable them to serve our guests with even greater speed and efficiency. All these efforts are in support of our ultimate goal, to deepen the already strong relationship we have established with our guests. While it was fantastic to see top-line growth in the second quarter, it was even more gratifying that it was driven by traffic, as more guests choose to make more trips to Target following unprecedented growth during the pandemic. Altogether, over the first six months of 2024, our guests have already made nearly 1 billion trips to Target, a number that's grown by more than 20% since 2019. We're grateful for the underlying trust and engagement behind every one of those transactions and our entire team is focused on delivering continued traffic growth over time. So now, before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to pause and thank our team. Back at our Financial Community Meeting in March, I described how they were united in their commitment to moving from go time to grow time. And they've certainly delivered and more. In an environment where consumers continue to make meaningful trade-offs, our Q2 results demonstrate the power that comes from the right combination of newness, seasonal relevance and compelling value. While that's great to see, the team isn't pausing to celebrate. Rather, they're leaning in as they focus on building additional momentum in the back half of the year and beyond. Our team is the best in retail. They're guest focused and they love to win, together. And they're just getting started. With that, I'll welcome Rick to his first earnings call.\nRick Gomez: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be joining this call today, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over time. Before we unpack our second quarter results, I'd like to spend some time sharing my priorities as I step into this role, many of which should sound very familiar. First, I want to reinforce the importance of the areas that Christina was focused on. Affordability, newness, seasonal relevance, and ease. These are mission critical. Under Christina's leadership over the years, we've built an incredible foundation which we can build upon. I've also worked with the team on three additional principles to govern how we work. First, we'll focus on simplifying processes end-to-end, including how our teams work together as well as with our external partners, with the goal of driving efficiencies and streamlining how work gets done. We should also be relentless in our pursuit of creativity, bringing innovative ideas to market that are original, inspiring, and unmistakably Target. And finally, we shouldn't be just guest-led, we should be consumer obsessed. We'll do this by consistently listening to what consumers want and need and then working hard to deliver for them. Next, I'll turn to our view of the consumer, which as you heard from Brian, has remained largely unchanged for some time. American families continue to deal with a lot. These pressures are clearly weighing on them, and they're looking for a refuge from the everyday stress that they're feeling. And yet while the economic data remains mixed, we see a consumer that is still willing and able to spend. Yes, they're still being choiceful. Yes, they're budget conscious. And yes, they're hunting for deals and everyday value. But they're also willing to shop when they find that right combination of fashion and newness at the right price. This was on full display in our second quarter results. As Brian mentioned, the team was committed to returning to growth this year, and they did just that in Q2, with comp growth of 2% driven entirely by traffic. Also of note, every one of our core categories saw traffic growth in the quarter. Sales from Target Circle 360 grew in the low teens this quarter, adding to our confidence that we have a long runway ahead of us to drive awareness and adoption of this differentiated service. In support of this goal, we recently rolled out a new monthly subscription option for Target Circle 360, allowing guests to get the best of Target delivered same day for just $10.99 per month and only $4.99 per month for students. Within our assortment in Q2, we saw notable areas of strength in both discretionary and frequency categories. As Brian highlighted, discretionary trends have been improving for a full year now, and combined discretionary comps were down only slightly in Q2. This momentum was most evident in our apparel assortment, which delivered low single-digit comp growth driven by newness in combination with strong everyday value, both in-stores and online. Comps were led by a performance category in the low double-digits as guests loved our latest designs and unbeatable prices in our All in Motion brand. Women's apparel saw growth in the low to mid-single-digits with particular strength in our young contemporary owned brand Wild Fable. And a recent relaunch of our intimate and sleepwear brand, Auden, has seen a strong guest reaction out of the gate, offering high quality and comfortable items at compelling price points, like $15 bras and $20 pajama sets. These results demonstrate the broad-based improvements that we're seeing in apparel, a trend we are eager to build on in the coming quarters and years. While our Home and Hardline trends remain softer than apparel, we've also seen meaningful trend improvement over the last year. In Home, Q2 comps accelerated by more than 7 percentage points compared with the first quarter, and early results in the back to school season are right on plan. Within Home, kitchen continues to stand out, based in part on our recent launch of Figmint, our high-performance kitchenware brand. Within Hardline, while sales and electronics are still under pressure, we've been leaning into other categories with stronger demand, driving a comp trend improvement of around 5 percentage points versus Q1, driven by newness in the category. Key growth areas include our affordable outdoor offerings in many markets, like $1 pool noodles and $10 coolers. Recently, we launched more than 1,000 new items and toys, including over a hundred new items in our own brand Gigglescape, which now includes preschool toys, games, puzzles, and an expansion into plush. And in case there was any question of the love for our brand with young shoppers, some of the fastest growing sales and toys are from Target-themed items, including plush bullseye dogs, kid-sized Target checkout lanes, Target-branded polly pocket toys, Target-branded fisher price little people, and so much more. Beauty continues to gain meaningful market share with comp growth in the high single digits in Q2, driven by a balanced combination of new offerings, celebrity brands, and seasonal relevance. This has been the summer of sun care, with guests looking for familiar, affordable options like up-and-up sunscreen, as well as newer, trending brands such as Vacation. Minis have also been a major growth driver, with travel on the rise and consumers looking for a little bit of affordable indulgence for at home too. In Food, comp sales growth in the low single-digits was led by seasonal moments with hundreds of new items across snacking, grilling and entertaining. With exclusive to target items like Bubly's Melted Ice Pop flavor, which quickly grew to be the highest selling item in its category, we helped guests celebrate summer with fun new flavors and items. In addition to seasonal moments, we've also pushed ourselves to rethink assortment strategies that have been tried and true for years. For example, we transitioned our candy aisles leading into some of the most popular trends like better-for-you options including lower sugar treats and wellness candies. While this category was already growing, these changes raised the bar, accelerating comp growth into the double digits. In Essentials, which also grew in the low single-digits overall, sales growth was largely driven by strength in our health category, where protein drinks, powders, and meal supplements are gaining momentum. Additionally, baby care and essentials continue to do well. Across categories, our own brands grew faster than the total enterprise, showcasing the relevance, quality and value we provide to consumers. In fact, because of our industry-leading design and sourcing capabilities, we are better positioned to remove unnecessary steps in the process, which allows us to reduce costs and increase speed to market. Throughout the second quarter, Target Circle members took advantage of enticing promotions, particularly during our latest Target Circle Week. In fact, this year's Target Circle Week has generated the highest digital traffic of the year so far. As Brian mentioned, we added more than 2 million new Target Circle members in the second quarter while also adding hundreds of thousands of Target Circle cardholders and Target Circle 360 members. Because of the invaluable insights we gained through Target Circle, we were able to offer 4 times more personalized offers as compared to a year ago. And of course, those same insights fuel our Roundel media network, which, as Brian mentioned, continues to benefit our business in multiple ways. While it's hard to believe that summer is already coming to an end, our focus is quickly turning to fall. This, of course, begins with a continuation of our back-to-school and college seasons, which reached their peak in the front half of Q3. More than 70% of our guests shop us during this time frame, and we have plenty in store for them to start the school year off with success and style. Knowing affordability is top of mind for consumers, in many markets this year, we're offering 20 of the most popular school supply items that together are priced under $20, including items like Mondo Llama crayons for just $0.25, notebooks for $0.50 and $5 backpacks. For our college-bound guests, we're offering a 20% discount to get their dorm room stocked, styled and ready for studying. And as we do every year, we're acknowledging the true classroom heroes, our teachers, with a special appreciation event offering an additional 20% off must-have supplies. As the fall season continues, we'll be introducing more and more newness across our assortment to celebrate all things autumn. In our performance category, we're offering new assortments from All in Motion, including our first-ever women's legging destination with new fabrications and a range of colors, sizes and silhouettes to make all bodies look and feel their best. In our women's categories, we're leaning into our fall fashion assortment, which includes wardrobe options anchored in head-to-toe on-trend neutrals and showcasing the disruptive value of core items for just $15. And new this year, we are showing out for the game day in a big way, with mix and match apparel items in your favorite college team colors to show some school spirit in style. Beyond fall fashion, we know consumers are eager for their apple and pumpkin spice favorites, so we're excited to bring back these fall flavors while introducing some new and trending ones as well. Our fall food assortment will offer more than 150 new owned brand items and more than 500 new national brand items, ranging from Pumpkin Donut Holes and Jack-o-Lantern sandwich cookies, to Pecan Pie Ice Cream and Good & Gather turkey stuffing flavored potato chips. From sweet to savory, guests will find all their favorites and be inspired by what will surely become some new favorites too. And while Halloween may seem far away, our consumer research and early season sales suggest there's a lot of excitement around this year's celebrations. Last year, social media was ablaze with videos of our 8-foot all Halloween pumpkin ghoul, Lewis. So we had to bring him back this season along with several new friends, all with their own sassy personalities and catch phrases. We're bringing that own brand love to our custom assortment to. Of course, we're standing to all for all the biggest characters of the season, but we're also seeing an outsized response to our Target branded costumes. And with 75% of the Halloween assortment new this year, we are confident guest will see Target as the Halloween destination for the season. As it turns out, which has come out for more than Halloween, one of the most anticipated films of the year, Universal Pictures' Wicked hits theaters this fall and our assortment will leave guests spellbound with a collection of licensed products that range from toys to apparel to housewares. We have big plans in store, including exclusive items to Target and we'll have more exciting details to share very soon. And of course, we don't have to wait for a changing of the season to change up our assortment. In Beauty, after years of meaningful investments in cosmetics and skincare offerings, we're investing in all things hair care. New from L'Oreal is the biggest innovation in at-home hair coloring in years, Colorsonic. This launch is off to a great start, and we see big things ahead for this brand. And more recently, on top of our exciting launch of Jennifer Aniston's LolaVie hair care line, we launched a new partnership with celebrity, Blake Lively, for her exclusive to Target line, Blake Brown : Hair Care, which quickly became our biggest hair care launch on record. On launch day alone, Blake Brown had the five best-selling hair care items at Target. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Target team. The past several years have been anything but routine, and this team has handled every change and turn with grace and a commitment to serving the communities in which we operate. Thank you, team Target, for all that you do for our guests and for each other. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, Rick. I'd like to join Brian in welcoming you to your first earnings call. I'm excited about all of the long-term growth opportunities we have in front of us as we work together to deliver more for our guests, for our team and for our shareholders. As Brian mentioned, I'm temporarily wearing two hats right now as I continue in the CFO role while preparing to fully move in the COO role. And while I'm looking forward to the day when I'm only wearing the COO hat, I'm privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented leaders and teams that are operating with a guest-first long-term focus that's fueling our results. Every day, I see their commitment to caring, growing and winning together. Whether I walking a store, a distribution center or the halls in our headquarters, there is no doubt in my mind that our team members are the number one reason that Target is such a special place to work. As we've been highlighting for some time, the operations team is focused on reinforcing retail fundamentals following an extended period of unprecedented volatility that began more than four years ago. While this effort encompasses many processes and metrics, nothing is more important than staying in stock and being reliable for our guests. And while our in-stock measures have been improving rapidly for some time now, we're going to continue our work to improve them even more. In the second quarter, total out of stocks were more than 500 basis points lower than a year ago. Also important, out of stocks on our top items in Q2, the ones with the highest unit velocity, were more than 50% lower than total out of stocks and also better than a year ago. Notably, these out-of-stock measures would have been even more favorable if our perishable food distribution facility in Denton, Texas had not sustained major damage from a severe storm in late May, something I'll return to later in my remarks. It's also notable that our total inventory investment at the end of Q2 was slightly lower than a year ago, meaning that the out-of-stock improvements we've been seeing are the result of operational improvements, not from simply flooding our network with more inventory. Of course, we're always focused on maintaining the right amount of inventory to deliver on our reliability goals, and we're already growing our inventory in categories where demand is strong. But overall, our business has been able to sustain stronger inventory turns than we've seen historically, something you'd expect to happen given the gains in sales per store we've seen over the last five years. Another area of focus for our team is the store shopping experience, most notably in the front end at checkout. With the recent changes we've made to streamline self-checkout, while ensuring we maintain adequate staffing in our full service lanes, we're seeing notably faster checkout times in our self-service lanes. In addition, with more people using our full-service lanes, our team has been engaging with nearly 15% more guests at checkout compared with last year. And with all of these changes, we've seen a continued substantial improvement in our Net Promoter Scores regarding the purchase experience, with scores related to wait times and interactions at checkout the strongest we've seen in six years. We're also making investments in technology to make it easier for our team members to serve our guests. Earlier this year, we integrated GenAI into the handheld devices in our stores, providing our team with rapid access to best practice documentation and the ability to quickly receive straightforward responses to common questions like, how do I sign a guest up for a Target Circle card, and how do I restart the cash register in the event of a power outage. Since the full chain rollout of this new tool, our team members have leveraged the technology more than 50,000 times, giving answers in a highly efficient average chat time of less than one minute. We'll continue to refine this tool over time based on feedback from our team, but many are already telling us that it's enhanced their everyday work experience, making it easier and faster for them to help our guests. In addition, leaders in our stores are telling us they expect this new tool will be particularly helpful as we bring on new permanent and seasonal team members in advance of this year's holiday season, helping them to become more productive, more quickly than in the past. Of course, while well documented, efficient and repeatable processes are critical to maintaining quality in a large operation, it's just as important to help our team to stay nimble and able to react to unforeseen events. And our team had to deal with several weather-related challenges in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our Denton, Texas perishable food distribution center sustained significant physical damage from a storm in late May, resulting in a prolonged site closure and significant product loss at that location. Following the storm, the team reacted quickly to minimize the impact, temporarily realigning perishable food replenishment for 220 locations with other distribution nodes, while our construction and distribution teams rushed to get the facility repaired and operational before the end of the quarter. Later in the quarter, in early July, Hurricane Beryl hit landfall in Southern Texas, and our team responded quickly to help their neighbors in affected communities. When power was lost in multiple locations, our team successfully kept stores open using generators, providing food, supplies and a safe place for community members to take shelter and charge their electronic devices. Our team helped to organize and deliver donations of critical supplies to their neighbors, while helping to clear debris from nearby roads in homes. And as always, our team members took care of each other from cooking meals for displaced colleagues to making sure everyone had access to emergency supplies and shelter. To support these heroic efforts in the field, we maintain a robust infrastructure, supported by a core team at our headquarters that's ready to provide communications and support when disasters happen. As part of these preparations, we reserve and preposition thousands of pallets of critical supplies throughout our distribution network, which can be quickly deployed to affected areas when events occur. We also maintain a command center at our headquarters that's equipped to monitor weather and other conditions in the areas where we operate, helping our field teams to prepare and react quickly to minimize the impact when adverse events affect our communities, colleagues and our business. And of course, we're proud to continue offering financial support in affected communities, having already made proactive donations of $2.5 million so far this year in support of our domestic and global disaster relief partners. Following Hurricane Beryl, our donations helped the American Red Cross stand up more than 10 evacuation centers in Houston. We also supported Team Rubicon as they worked to clear fallen trees, helped homeowners navigate FEMA applications for disaster assistance, aided the footprint project in providing solar generators to power homes and medical machines, and provided food, medicine and other critical supplies to the hardest hit neighborhoods. So much of our Target Forward sustainability strategy is dedicated to working across the business, to address community needs and drive meaningful and positive impact. Through Target's philanthropy and volunteerism, and by integrating business assets to meet the needs of our communities, we aim to be present in ways that help all families thrive, knowing the guests and communities we serve are critical to the success of our business. So, I want to pause and thank our entire team for their tireless efforts, both every day and especially during times of need. You serve as the face of the company in all of the communities where we live and work, and you are the biggest reason consumers love our brand. I'm proud to work with you and grateful for everything you do to support our business, our communities and your fellow team members. So now, I want to pivot and provide a quick update on our sortation center strategy, which continues to benefit our business in multiple ways. A critical aspect of this strategy is faster delivery speeds as local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than a day faster than our network average. But notably, that increase in speed doesn't require more dollars, as our unit delivery costs from a sort center are about 20% lower than our network average. On top of that direct benefit, opening a sortation center in the market frees up processing space in the stores it serves, while delivering labor savings in those locations as well. With all of these benefits, you can see why we're excited to continue expanding the reach of this capability. And just this month, we're opening our 11th sort center in the Detroit market, where it's expected to serve more than 3 million consumers. By 2028, this facility is expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily while operating in a smaller-than-average footprint. And beyond growth in the number of these facilities, our existing sort centers continue to ramp up their capacity, and we're finding new ways to integrate them into our broader network. For example, our recently opened sort center in Chicago will be feeding the Detroit sortation center, increasing the number of packages eligible for next-day delivery in that market. Altogether this year, our sortation centers have processed 19% more packages than a year ago. So, now I want to turn to our second quarter financial results. As Brian highlighted earlier, the 2% increase in our Q2 comp sales was driven entirely by traffic. This traffic increase was partially offset by a decline in average ticket, which included a decrease in our average selling price when compared with a year ago. As Brian mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments, leading to strength around the Memorial Day holiday as well as the Fourth of July and our most recent Target Circle Week later in the quarter. Within the quarter, comp sales were strongest in June and July, and trends were very similar between those two months on a reported basis. Most importantly, traffic grew in all three months of the quarter. Beyond our comp sales, second quarter total revenue growth of 2.7% reflected the benefit from sales in non-mature stores and double-digit growth in other revenue, driven primarily by strong growth in our Roundel ad business. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 28.9% was about 190 basis points higher than a year ago. About 90 basis points of this improvement was driven by our merchandising strategies, which included the ongoing benefit of our efficiency work. We also saw about 40 basis points of benefit from category sales mix, which was largely offset by cost pressures from digital fulfillment and supply chain. Finally, our gross margin rate reflected about 90 basis points of benefit from lower inventory shrink, compared with a 20 basis point benefit in the first quarter. While our guidance assumes that the year-over-year benefit from shrink would increase this quarter, we've seen better-than-expected results in our most recent store inventory counts, resulting in a bigger-than-expected financial benefit in Q2. Based on these updated accounts, we're now expecting our Q3 gross margin rate will also benefit from lower shrink costs, but expect the magnitude of that benefit will be less than half of what we just experienced in the second quarter. And for Q4, given the financial benefit we were already seeing a year ago, we're expecting shrink costs will be approximately flat to last year. While it's encouraging to see this progress, we'll continue our work to move shrink rates down to more sustainable levels in the years ahead, given the steep increase in shrink that our business has absorbed over the last five years. Our second quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.2% was about 30 basis points higher than a year ago. This increase reflected cost increases in multiple parts of our business, along with continued investments in our team, which were partially offset by lower remodel expenses, savings from our efficiency work and continued disciplined cost management throughout the enterprise. Overall, our Q2 operating margin rate of 6.4% was about 160 basis points higher than last year as we continue to build back our profitability from the significant headwinds we've encountered over the last couple of years. Regarding our inventory, we continue to feel good about our position. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 ending inventory on the balance sheet was slightly lower than a year ago. However, given all of the volatility we've experienced since the pandemic began, one-year comparisons can be hard to interpret. As such, we still find it useful to compare relative growth rates back to 2019. And if you perform that comparison for the second quarter, you'll see that both our sales and ending inventory have grown about 38% over those five years, reinforcing our view that we're positioned appropriately as we enter the back half of the year. Now, I'd like to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our long-standing priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we look to support the dividend and build on our more than 50-year record of increasing the annual dividend. And finally, we look to return any excess cash that's available after these first two uses by engaging in share repurchases over time within the limits of our late credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we've allocated $1.3 billion to capital expenditures through the first half of the year and continue to expect full year CapEx in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we returned $509 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in Q2, representing growth of about $10 million over last year. And finally, we returned to share repurchases in the second quarter, allocating $155 million to retire 1.1 million shares of our stock. Given the work of our team to strengthen our balance sheet over the last 18 months and the simultaneous improvements we've seen in our profitability and cash flow, we were happy to get back to repurchases this quarter. We expect to have continued repurchase capacity in the back half of 2024 and in years ahead. So now, I want to end my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which is an important measure of the quality of both our financial results and our capital investments. Through the 12 months ending in the second quarter, our after-tax ROIC of 16.6% was nearly 3 percentage points higher than a year ago. While this is already a very strong after-tax return, our long-term financial plans envision continued growth of this metric into the high teens over time. Now, I'd like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. And while our performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high. Against that backdrop, our experience over the last several years has shown us that a prudent outlook, while maintaining the team's agility, is the best way to position our business. As such, we've taken a measured approach to our forward-looking guidance, and our team remains ready to respond if the pace of our business turns out to be stronger. With these considerations as context, we're planning for third quarter comparable sales growth in the 0% to 2% range, and GAAP and adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.40. And while our full year comp guidance range remains the same at 0% to 2% growth and the breadth of possibilities remains quite wide, our baseline plan for the fall season would put us in the lower half of that range for the full year. However, in light of the strong financial performance our business has already delivered in the first half of the year, we've raised our full year GAAP and adjusted EPS range to $9 to $9.70 compared with our prior range of $8.60 to $9.60. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we provided insight into our financial aspirations over the next 10 years. At their core, those aspirations are based on two basic assumptions, healthy growth on the top line and reaching the appropriate level of profitability on the bottom line. In the second quarter, in an environment where consumers are focused on value and making tough trade-offs in their spending decisions, our team delivered newness, value and reliability to our guests, resulting in top line growth beyond our baseline expectations and even faster growth in guest traffic. And importantly, even in a challenging environment, we also expanded our Q2 operating margin rate. We are really proud of these results, which reflect the hard work and dedication of our outstanding team. At the same time, this quarter was only the first step on a much longer journey and we have a lot more work ahead of us. More specifically, with 2019 as a baseline, the second quarter was the first time in a while in which our EPS grew faster than the top line, with total revenue growth of 38% over that five-year period and EPS growth of more than 41%. Our guidance for the remainder of the year implies further expansion of both of those metrics. And based on our growth initiatives, ongoing efficiency work and continued opportunity to reduce the impact of inventory shrink, we expect to see additional progress in the years ahead. We have a clear vision of how we're going to get there and the right team in place to make it happen. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to spend a minute on a concept we've touched on before, which is the way we uniquely leverage the power of hand in our business. The recent Target is so unique, and why we've developed such a special bond with consumers is because we offer something different than everyone else in the marketplace. We offer great prices, convenience, compelling promotions and a great shopping experience. Our nearly 2,000 stores are accessible to the vast majority of the US population, and we have a comprehensive suite of fast and convenient digital fulfillment options. For a destination in discretionary categories like Apparel, Home and Hardlines; in frequency categories, like Essentials and Food & Beverage 'and in Beauty, which perfectly straddles both, we offer a broad range of items, serve as a convenient one-stop shop and we're well known for curating our merchandise assortment. We are a style leader. We're known for celebrating seasonal moments and we offer reliability on everyday wants and needs. When we're at our best, we achieve a proper balance between all of those aspects or go-to-market strategy, and the second quarter was a textbook example of Target being Target. I'm incredibly proud of our team for delivering better-than-expected results in an environment where consumers are facing multiple challenges. Knowing there's more work to be done, our team is on their front foot and ready to deliver more for our guests in the third quarter and beyond. Our team's positive energy is contagious, and I look forward to working with them as they continue to move Target forward in the quarters and years ahead. So with that, we'll move to Q&A. Rick, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nKate McShane: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. You mentioned that you haven't seen a notable change in the consumer versus what you've seen year-to-date. Can you help us understand or reconcile your ability to get to the high end of guidance range for quarter two, maintain the guidance range for Q3, but also flagged that you are likely to get to the lower end for the same-store sales guidance range for the year?\nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks for the question, Kate. I think the headline is at the start of your question, we see a consumer that's largely consistent with how we would have described the consumer over the last couple of quarters. Consumer that's been resilient overall in their spending and flat in spite of significant inflation over the last couple of years, a consumer that's choiceful. And so our combination of getting newness and value right in the second quarter led to the performance that was at the top end of our expectations. As we look at the balance of the year, we've got more of the year in front of us than is behind us, and we think it's prudent to take a measured review against the kind of consumer behaviors we'll be watching over the balance of the year. But importantly, that guidance is still centered on growth. We expect to continue to grow in Q3. We expect to have a growth story for the year. And you can see us playing offense appropriately against that goal, but being measured in our outlook. We think that's the right way to position the business.\nBrian Cornell: Kate, just to build on Michael's comments. I think in this environment, where there is so much consumer uncertainty, we're taking the appropriate approach to guidance in the third quarter. But as you heard from Rick and from Michael, we're continuing to play to win, and we feel very good about how we're prepared for the big seasonal moments. We're in back-to-school right now and back to college. We're excited about Halloween. And Rick and his team are planning for some unique moments during the holiday season. So I don't want anyone to be confused with what we think is the appropriate outlook for the third quarter, but the fact that we're going to continue to play offense. We're going to look to drive traffic into our stores and visit to our site, and make sure we deliver great value along with newness for our guests throughout the season.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So, I just wanted to go back to the operating margin performance during the quarter. We saw a very strong delivery during the quarter. How do you feel about the sustainability of the improvement and then over time getting back to that 6% plus margins on an annual basis?\nMichael Fiddelke: Yeah, thanks for the question, Rupesh. As we laid out at the start of the year, this year was going to be about progress to that better margin performance over time, and two quarters in, I just can't thank the team enough for their work to put us solidly on the path of the improvement that we laid out for the year. If you unpacked the quarter, I hit on some of this in my remarks, but it always starts with the top line. So, to grow the top line at a 2% comp, to see a category like apparel, so we like the margins in apparel, to see that category return to growth helped us from a mix perspective. Great work by the team to continue to find efficiency within the business. And we expected a more promotional environment this year. We've certainly seen that so far, but you can see the strength on the margin line due to the team's really hard work to continue to squeeze efficiencies out of the business in ways big and small. And we're pleased with the progress we're making on shrink. Now, there's some noise quarter to quarter about how that will come through. So I tried to unpack some of those details in my prepared remarks. But the net punchline there is we're ahead of where we expected to be in terms of progress on shrink too. So all of that's adding up to an earnings result we're certainly pleased with. And our work going forward will be to continue that momentum in Q3 and Q4.\nBrian Cornell: Rupesh, I\u2019d just amplify a couple of the comments that you've heard us make over the last few quarters and really recognize the focus the team's placed on retail fundamentals. Michael talked about the progress in reliability, improving our in-stocks. Rick's talked about the improvement in value and the commitments we've made to making sure we provide value to our guests, no matter where they're shopping and how they're shopping. And I think that focus on controlling the things we can control is really helping us improve our operating margin performance. But the team has been very focused on retail fundamentals, execution each and every day both from a physical standpoint and a digital standpoint. And I think you're seeing the benefits of that pay off.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is, can you talk more specifically about what drove the strength in the merchandise margin strategies in the second quarter? And what are you embedding in the back-half in terms of sustainability?\nMichael Fiddelke: Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. There's a lot that goes into that margin line on any quarter. And so the headlines are some we've touched on a little bit already. We've definitely seen a more promotional environment. But against that backdrop, the teams have worked hard to find efficiencies within the business. And that can show up in ways big and small. To give a tangible example, one of the things that we've continued to see progress with is -- the most expensive thing we do in fulfilling product is shipping a brown box, and we've seen significant improvement in the cost per unit of that activity, as teams have worked to better align inventory with where we see demand. So we have to split shipments frequently. And the core productivity within those processes, big improvements in our stores team, delivering that product more efficiently as we pick and pack in the stores, and so that work adds up. And the teams have been at it for multiple quarters now, and we're seeing it pay off.\nChris Horvers: Understood. And then on the top line, I was just curious how you forecast the business. Obviously, the consumer has been a lot more volatile, a lot more event-driven. There seems like there was some pause in the back half July. As you plan the business, do you look at seasonal revenues building off the second quarter? Are you looking at stacks? Are you looking at trends versus 2019? Just some insight there in terms of how you forecast the business.\nBrian Cornell: Chris, I think you've covered many of the things we look at on an ongoing basis. And I think we factored all those different variables into our outlook for the period and the quarter.\nChris Horvers: Thanks very much.\nBrian Cornell: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on a near-term question first. Sounds like comps June and July were relatively steady. And I don't know if -- you've talked about product for back-to-school. Curious about how the consumer is behaving. And then connected to it, any expectation when discretionary comps may inflect a positive?\nBrian Cornell: Simeon, as we sit here today, obviously, we're in the heart of back-to-school season, kind of the early chapters of back to college. And as Rick talked about, excited about the upcoming Halloween season. I think as we sit here today, we feel well prepared for those big seasonal moments, and we'll continue to make sure we lean in with a great physical and digital experience.\nSimeon Gutman: Maybe one follow-up. Can I ask about price investments, the 5,000 items that have been lowered if, one, I assume you're pleased with some of the elasticity. Does it make you think about price positioning broadly? Are there opportunities to enhance the price position in other places? Thanks.\nBrian Cornell: I think we sit here today, we feel really good about the way the consumers reacted to the price investments we've made on those 5,000 frequently purchased items, but it really goes beyond those investments. If you're a Target Circle member, you're getting personalized offers every time you shop. If you're using a Target Circle card, you have the opportunity for that 5% discount. If you're taking advantage of the amazing value we provide through our own brands, that's just one more way to find value when you're shopping with Target. So, it's really a bundle of all those things that we do each and every day to strengthen the relationship we have with the guests and provide them with the value they're looking for in this economic environment.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nBrian Cornell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nRobby Ohmes: Hey, good morning and a outstanding quarter. I was hoping, maybe from Brian or others, you could talk about a couple things. Target Circle penetration. It hasn't been going up. Is that expected to change? And also same day delivery is still, I guess, Target Circle 360 as you call it, is still not growing as fast as Drive Up. Is that expected to change? And would changing these things potentially be a sales driver? And then is there any margin implication from that on the offset?\nBrian Cornell: Robby, you've got three or four questions there. I'm going to let Michael start, and I'll pick it up from there.\nMichael Fiddelke: Yeah. Importantly, Robby, I'll kind of take your second point first. We're really pleased with our Circle 360 same-day delivery business, both it and Drive Up grew in the low teens. And so we've seen some acceleration in that business on the heels of our relaunch of Circle, and so we're encouraged by that. And importantly, for both of those services, we've talked about this before, but I think it warrants a reemphasis. The thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 same-day delivery is they spend meaningfully more at Target in total, and their in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services. And so, we continue to watch that relationship closely and growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet with the consumers that use those services. Speaking to Circle more specifically, and I believe your question was focused on Circle card penetration, we see that opportunity over time with the relaunch of Circle to bring some investment back to growing our card business. One of the things that, that relaunch of Circle provides is it brings the core base Circle program, where guests can find incredible value through the personalized offers that they receive every day; with the Circle card program, where you can save an extra 5% if you're a Circle card member; with Circle 360 program, if you want the best of Target brought to your doorstep. And the integration of those programs, we think, provides a good jumping off point over time to continue to reinvigorate the Circle card business, but that's going to be a journey of quarters and years.\nBrian Cornell: Robby, just to clarify a couple of points. From a base Circle program standpoint, we did note that while we start with a base of over 100 million members, during the July Circle Week, we saw 2 million new members join the brand. You talked about Drive Up and Target Circle 360. And Drive Up has been a very sticky service for us and just continues to grow. And during the second quarter, we saw a Drive Up grow over 14%, and a nice acceleration in Target Circle 360 same-day delivery of almost 14%. So, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our Target Circle 360 program. But I'd really highlight Drive Up has been a stellar performance for us for many years now and just continues to grow. It was a $2 billion business for us in the second quarter. And I think, Michael, year-to-date is almost $4 billion. So it's been a really important service that we know our guest appreciates. But to Michael's point, we know they're a Drive Up user, they're going to spend time in a Target store, and we really like that combination.\nRobby Ohmes: Sounds great. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Kelly with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.\nEd Kelly: Yeah, hi. Good morning. I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on discretionary comps. Still negative here. What do you think is happening with market share at this point? And then maybe can you talk a bit about when you think that category in total, may inflect positively?\nBrian Cornell: Ed, I'm going to let Rick talk about some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories. He talked about the strength in Apparel and some of those subsets within Apparel, but we're also seeing green shoots in other areas. And we certainly think that over time in categories like Home, led by Kitchen, as these purchase cycles become ones that need to be replaced, you're going to see some strength in those categories. But Rick, why don't you walk through some of the trends you're seeing in discretionary categories.\nRick Gomez: Sure. I'd be happy to give a little color commentary to the trends and what's driving those trends. And what we're seeing in discretionary is when we offer on-trend stylish product at a great price, the consumer responds. And we're seeing that in Apparel. Apparel delivered a 3% comp. So real bright spots was All in Motion performance brand, where the team did a fantastic job on fabrication, colors, fit. $25 leggings with a fan favorite and really demonstrated the power of fashion combined with affordability. Beyond that, Beauty is also a standout, where we see news really resonating with the guests. I mentioned in the comments, but it's really exciting to see the success of Blake Lively's new hair care line, Blake Brown. We just launched it a few weeks ago, and it is already the most successful hair care launch that we have ever had a Target. And I think this is another great example of the consumer is willing to buy when they find that right combination of on-trend, stylish product at an affordable price. And even in other businesses, I use Home as an example, consumers want to freshen up their home. They want to freshen up their look, but they need to do it on a budget. So where we see growth is things like candles, decorative accessories, throw pillows. We're seeing growth there because we're offering an inexpensive way to freshen up the look of your home. So again, it goes back to delivering stylish on-trend product at a great price.\nBrian Cornell: And I'll give you one of my favorite examples from earlier this year, and it's a collaboration we had with our partners at Authentic Brands, leveraging the Prince brand. And while that brand has been known for tenants throughout the years, we brought the Prince category and the Prince brand into pickleball, with great new apparel, accessories and rackets. And we've created a destination and target for all things pickleball. We know families across the country are enjoying that sport. It fits very nicely with our all-family position. And it's just one more example of when Target is Target. When we bring great design that's on trend at a great value, we see the guests reacting really positively. So you'll see Rick and his team continue to make sure that we're bringing that combination of design and on trend, great value, great newness into those categories to continue to spark greater demand. Operator, we have time for one final question today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nCorey Tarlowe: Good morning, and thank you so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you talk a little bit about your expectations for longer-term mix of Food & Beverage over time. That's a category where you've continued to grow over the last several years, specifically since the pandemic, especially as you've widened the assortment and the number of items that you've carried in that category. So, we\u2019d be really curious to hear your thoughts around the long-term trajectory for that business over time.\nBrian Cornell: Corey, I'm happy to start, and I'm going to turn it over to Rick who, obviously, was leading our Food & Beverage business. We think we have significant opportunity for growth in that space, led by the unique combination, again, of great national brand partnerships and some really strong owned brands that are connected with the consumer. So we think we're still in the early days of building out our Food business. But, Rick, you've got so much experience in the space, why don't you share some of your thoughts?\nRick Gomez: I'd be happy to offer a little colored commentary on the Food & Beverage business. And as Brian said, we believe there is continued runway for the business to deliver growth, driven by a few things. The first is continued emphasis on affordability. As we talked about, the 5,000 price reductions across everyday items was incredibly well received. We'll continue to lean into value on our Food & Beverage business, not just through everyday pricing, but also through personalized promotions on Circle, as well as with our own brand portfolio, which offers incredible value. The second thing that we\u2019ll continue to lean in to drive growth for Food & Beverage will be newness. Just going into the fall season, right now, we have a ton of new products coming, over 150 new and owned brand products, over 500 new national brand products. Leveraging those flavors that everybody loves for the fall. I'm talking about Pumpkin Spice, Apple, Pecan Pie, that will continue to fuel growth. And then the last opportunity to continue to drive growth in our Food & Beverage business is around ease and convenience. Consumers have a lot on their plate, and they're looking for simple solutions, and we're very excited about the continued growth that we're seeing on both Drive Up as well as same-day delivery, which is achieving double-digit growth in Q2, and we continue to see runway on that going forward.\nBrian Cornell: Operator, that concludes our second quarter conference call. I appreciate everyone joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again soon.",

            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my remarks today by welcoming Rick Gomez to this call, following his recent move into the role of Chief Commercial Officer. This change was one of several we announced in June, including Christina Hennington's move into the role of Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, and Lisa Roath's transition into the role of Chief Merchandising Officer of Food, Essentials, and Beauty. Lisa has done a fantastic job leading our marketing team, and I've asked her to remain in that role until early 2025. This will provide adequate time for us to complete an external search for her successor, before Lisa brings her impressive commercial leadership experience back into the merchandising team. These changes follow our January announcement that Michael would move into the pivotal role of our Chief Operating Officer. Michael took on the CFO role just before the pandemic, and he's done an outstanding job leading the company through a period of unprecedented growth and volatility. The search for Michael's replacement as CFO is ongoing, and I share Michael's excitement for the time when he's able to fully focus on his new role leading all of our operational functions. And, of course, we were pleased this month to welcome Amy Tu into the role of Chief Legal and Compliance Officer. During her career, Amy has served in key leadership roles for several Fortune 100 companies, and I'm excited to welcome her to the Target team. Amy is taking the place of Don Liu on our team as he prepares for his retirement. I want to pause and thank Don for his many years of thoughtful and conscientious service to Target and our stakeholders. He is an outstanding leader who has served as a trusted partner to me, to our Board, and our entire leadership team during his tenure here at Target. All of these changes in our team are just the latest evidence of our focus on developing enterprise leaders, ones who go well beyond subject matter expertise to develop strong leadership skills with a foundation based on a comprehensive understanding of our business and how we fit into the broader landscape. And as you've seen from our second quarter results, the strength of our entire team was clearly evident in our financial performance, which came in well above our expectations. On the top line, we met our goal of returning to growth, but moved well beyond that baseline expectation. More specifically, our Q2 comparable sales grew 2%, at the very top end of our guidance range. And on the bottom line for the quarter, our EPS of $2.57 was well above the high end of our guidance, representing growth of more than 42% over last year. Among the drivers of our comp sales, we're pleased that our second quarter growth was driven entirely by traffic, reflecting the combined benefits of the multiple guest-focused initiatives we outlined in our Financial Community Meeting back in March. It's also notable that our store and digital channels both saw growth in Q2. Our digital team has done an outstanding job of enhancing our digital experience and that's showing through in our business results. We saw high single-digit growth in our digital comps in Q2 and even faster growth in same-day services led by Drive Up and Target Circle 360, both of which grew in the low teens. Same-day services now account for more than two-thirds of our digital sales with the biggest contribution from Drive Up, which generated sales of more than $2 billion in Q2 and more than $4 billion so far this year. Our balanced, multi-category merchandising assortment continues to resonate with our guests as trends strengthened across the board in Q2. And we were particularly encouraged to see discretionary category trends improve for the fourth consecutive quarter. In apparel, comp sales grew by more than 3%, marking an improvement of more than 5 percentage points when compared with the first quarter. Our apparel team has done a fantastic job of incorporating great design, newness, and value throughout their assortment, most notably in our All in Motion brand, which delivered growth in the low teens. Beauty was another standout as the category continued to gain share with comp growth of 9% in Q2, on top of double-digit growth a year ago. On the frequency side of our assortment, both our food and beverage, and essential categories saw traffic growth in the quarter as consumers are responding to our offerings in an environment where they're focused on value. Over the summer, we reduced our prices on about 5,000 frequently purchased items in many markets and we saw an acceleration in both our unit and dollar sales trends in these businesses. We're also seeing continued momentum in our Target Circle loyalty platform following its relaunch in the first quarter. With over 100 million members, we're always happy to welcome new guests who choose to join and we added more than 2 million new members in the second quarter. But our aspirations go well beyond growing our membership base. We redesigned Target Circle with the goal of increasing engagement among existing members and we've already realized the benefits. For example, during our July Target Circle week, about two-thirds of our transactions were made by Target Circle members. Beyond the direct benefit of guest engagement with the platform, Target Circle also helps us gain deep consumer insights, allowing us to extend more personal, customized offers through our Roundel advertising business. Roundel continues to experience rapid growth, based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors. In the second quarter, Roundel delivered double-digit growth to the benefit of both gross margin and the other revenue line of our P&L. For the full year, Roundel is expected to grow in the high teens, on top of more than 20% growth in 2023. As we continue to survey consumers and monitor the external environment, our view remains largely the same, as we've been sharing for some time. Consumers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of multiple challenges over the last several years, and they remain resilient today. Given the significant headwinds they have faced with inflation over the last few years, consumers continue to focus on value as they work hard to manage their household budgets. And while they continue to turn out and shop around holidays and other seasonal moments, many are delaying purchases until the moment of need. Against that backdrop, our team continues to focus on providing unbeatable value for our guests. And of course, that starts with a focus on low everyday prices, including our recent price reductions on frequently purchased items. But our focus on value only begins with low prices. Whether we're highlighting compelling deals for our Target Circle members, offering an additional 5% savings to our Target Circle cardholders, designing and sourcing high quality owned brands at compelling prices, or delivering ease and convenience with Drive Up and Target Circle 360, our team is continually working to find more ways to deliver more value for our guests. As we look ahead, Our team is focused on controlling what we can control. We're committed to staying on offense while maintaining an overall cautious outlook, a stance that has worked well for us over the last few quarters. Throughout the company, we're focused on retail fundamentals and strong execution. This includes our commitment to being in stock and reliable, even as we maintain a prudent inventory position. It also includes our focus on delivering speed and convenience in every fulfillment channel, while providing efficient and friendly service to our guests in every store every day. We're also looking to build on the momentum we've been seeing in discretionary categories, where trends have already improved significantly, and we see much more opportunity ahead of us. We're focused on continued expansion of our operating margin rate as we move back towards and potentially beyond the 6% annual rate we were earning before the pandemic. We're committed to continued disciplined capital deployment. Following more than a year of hard work to strengthen our balance sheet, we were pleased to get back to share our purchases in the second quarter and we expect to have continued capacity within our middle A ratings in Q3 and beyond. And of course, we're focused on continued investment in our team, in their training, development, pay, and benefits. To support our team, we're making smart investments in AI technology to make their work easier and more productive, enable them to serve our guests with even greater speed and efficiency. All these efforts are in support of our ultimate goal, to deepen the already strong relationship we have established with our guests. While it was fantastic to see top-line growth in the second quarter, it was even more gratifying that it was driven by traffic, as more guests choose to make more trips to Target following unprecedented growth during the pandemic. Altogether, over the first six months of 2024, our guests have already made nearly 1 billion trips to Target, a number that's grown by more than 20% since 2019. We're grateful for the underlying trust and engagement behind every one of those transactions and our entire team is focused on delivering continued traffic growth over time. So now, before I turn the call over to Rick, I want to pause and thank our team. Back at our Financial Community Meeting in March, I described how they were united in their commitment to moving from go time to grow time. And they've certainly delivered and more. In an environment where consumers continue to make meaningful trade-offs, our Q2 results demonstrate the power that comes from the right combination of newness, seasonal relevance and compelling value. While that's great to see, the team isn't pausing to celebrate. Rather, they're leaning in as they focus on building additional momentum in the back half of the year and beyond. Our team is the best in retail. They're guest focused and they love to win, together. And they're just getting started. With that, I'll welcome Rick to his first earnings call. Thanks, Michael. Before we turn to your questions, I want to spend a minute on a concept we've touched on before, which is the way we uniquely leverage the power of hand in our business. The recent Target is so unique, and why we've developed such a special bond with consumers is because we offer something different than everyone else in the marketplace. We offer great prices, convenience, compelling promotions and a great shopping experience. Our nearly 2,000 stores are accessible to the vast majority of the US population, and we have a comprehensive suite of fast and convenient digital fulfillment options. For a destination in discretionary categories like Apparel, Home and Hardlines; in frequency categories, like Essentials and Food & Beverage 'and in Beauty, which perfectly straddles both, we offer a broad range of items, serve as a convenient one-stop shop and we're well known for curating our merchandise assortment. We are a style leader. We're known for celebrating seasonal moments and we offer reliability on everyday wants and needs. When we're at our best, we achieve a proper balance between all of those aspects or go-to-market strategy, and the second quarter was a textbook example of Target being Target. I'm incredibly proud of our team for delivering better-than-expected results in an environment where consumers are facing multiple challenges. Knowing there's more work to be done, our team is on their front foot and ready to deliver more for our guests in the third quarter and beyond. Our team's positive energy is contagious, and I look forward to working with them as they continue to move Target forward in the quarters and years ahead. So with that, we'll move to Q&A. Rick, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions. Kate, just to build on Michael's comments. I think in this environment, where there is so much consumer uncertainty, we're taking the appropriate approach to guidance in the third quarter. But as you heard from Rick and from Michael, we're continuing to play to win, and we feel very good about how we're prepared for the big seasonal moments. We're in back-to-school right now and back to college. We're excited about Halloween. And Rick and his team are planning for some unique moments during the holiday season. So I don't want anyone to be confused with what we think is the appropriate outlook for the third quarter, but the fact that we're going to continue to play offense. We're going to look to drive traffic into our stores and visit to our site, and make sure we deliver great value along with newness for our guests throughout the season. Rupesh, I'd just amplify a couple of the comments that you've heard us make over the last few quarters and really recognize the focus the team's placed on retail fundamentals. Michael talked about the progress in reliability, improving our in-stocks. Rick's talked about the improvement in value and the commitments we've made to making sure we provide value to our guests, no matter where they're shopping and how they're shopping. And I think that focus on controlling the things we can control is really helping us improve our operating margin performance. But the team has been very focused on retail fundamentals, execution each and every day both from a physical standpoint and a digital standpoint. And I think you're seeing the benefits of that pay off. Chris, I think you've covered many of the things we look at on an ongoing basis. And I think we factored all those different variables into our outlook for the period and the quarter. Thanks, Chris. Simeon, as we sit here today, obviously, we're in the heart of back-to-school season, kind of the early chapters of back to college. And as Rick talked about, excited about the upcoming Halloween season. I think as we sit here today, we feel well prepared for those big seasonal moments, and we'll continue to make sure we lean in with a great physical and digital experience. I think we sit here today, we feel really good about the way the consumers reacted to the price investments we've made on those 5,000 frequently purchased items, but it really goes beyond those investments. If you're a Target Circle member, you're getting personalized offers every time you shop. If you're using a Target Circle card, you have the opportunity for that 5% discount. If you're taking advantage of the amazing value we provide through our own brands, that's just one more way to find value when you're shopping with Target. So, it's really a bundle of all those things that we do each and every day to strengthen the relationship we have with the guests and provide them with the value they're looking for in this economic environment. Thank you. Robby, you've got three or four questions there. I'm going to let Michael start, and I'll pick it up from there. Robby, just to clarify a couple of points. From a base Circle program standpoint, we did note that while we start with a base of over 100 million members, during the July Circle Week, we saw 2 million new members join the brand. You talked about Drive Up and Target Circle 360. And Drive Up has been a very sticky service for us and just continues to grow. And during the second quarter, we saw a Drive Up grow over 14%, and a nice acceleration in Target Circle 360 same-day delivery of almost 14%. So, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our Target Circle 360 program. But I'd really highlight Drive Up has been a stellar performance for us for many years now and just continues to grow. It was a $2 billion business for us in the second quarter. And I think, Michael, year-to-date is almost $4 billion. So it's been a really important service that we know our guest appreciates. But to Michael's point, we know they're a Drive Up user, they're going to spend time in a Target store, and we really like that combination. Ed, I'm going to let Rick talk about some of the trends we're seeing in discretionary categories. He talked about the strength in Apparel and some of those subsets within Apparel, but we're also seeing green shoots in other areas. And we certainly think that over time in categories like Home, led by Kitchen, as these purchase cycles become ones that need to be replaced, you're going to see some strength in those categories. But Rick, why don't you walk through some of the trends you're seeing in discretionary categories. And I'll give you one of my favorite examples from earlier this year, and it's a collaboration we had with our partners at Authentic Brands, leveraging the Prince brand. And while that brand has been known for tenants throughout the years, we brought the Prince category and the Prince brand into pickleball, with great new apparel, accessories and rackets. And we've created a destination and target for all things pickleball. We know families across the country are enjoying that sport. It fits very nicely with our all-family position. And it's just one more example of when Target is Target. When we bring great design that's on trend at a great value, we see the guests reacting really positively. So you'll see Rick and his team continue to make sure that we're bringing that combination of design and on trend, great value, great newness into those categories to continue to spark greater demand. Operator, we have time for one final question today. Corey, I'm happy to start, and I'm going to turn it over to Rick who, obviously, was leading our Food & Beverage business. We think we have significant opportunity for growth in that space, led by the unique combination, again, of great national brand partnerships and some really strong owned brands that are connected with the consumer. So we think we're still in the early days of building out our Food business. But, Rick, you've got so much experience in the space, why don't you share some of your thoughts? Operator, that concludes our second quarter conference call. I appreciate everyone joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again soon."

            "name": "Rick Gomez",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be joining this call today, and I'm looking forward to meeting many of you over time. Before we unpack our second quarter results, I'd like to spend some time sharing my priorities as I step into this role, many of which should sound very familiar. First, I want to reinforce the importance of the areas that Christina was focused on. Affordability, newness, seasonal relevance, and ease. These are mission critical. Under Christina's leadership over the years, we've built an incredible foundation which we can build upon. I've also worked with the team on three additional principles to govern how we work. First, we'll focus on simplifying processes end-to-end, including how our teams work together as well as with our external partners, with the goal of driving efficiencies and streamlining how work gets done. We should also be relentless in our pursuit of creativity, bringing innovative ideas to market that are original, inspiring, and unmistakably Target. And finally, we shouldn't be just guest-led, we should be consumer obsessed. We'll do this by consistently listening to what consumers want and need and then working hard to deliver for them. Next, I'll turn to our view of the consumer, which as you heard from Brian, has remained largely unchanged for some time. American families continue to deal with a lot. These pressures are clearly weighing on them, and they're looking for a refuge from the everyday stress that they're feeling. And yet while the economic data remains mixed, we see a consumer that is still willing and able to spend. Yes, they're still being choiceful. Yes, they're budget conscious. And yes, they're hunting for deals and everyday value. But they're also willing to shop when they find that right combination of fashion and newness at the right price. This was on full display in our second quarter results. As Brian mentioned, the team was committed to returning to growth this year, and they did just that in Q2, with comp growth of 2% driven entirely by traffic. Also of note, every one of our core categories saw traffic growth in the quarter. Sales from Target Circle 360 grew in the low teens this quarter, adding to our confidence that we have a long runway ahead of us to drive awareness and adoption of this differentiated service. In support of this goal, we recently rolled out a new monthly subscription option for Target Circle 360, allowing guests to get the best of Target delivered same day for just $10.99 per month and only $4.99 per month for students. Within our assortment in Q2, we saw notable areas of strength in both discretionary and frequency categories. As Brian highlighted, discretionary trends have been improving for a full year now, and combined discretionary comps were down only slightly in Q2. This momentum was most evident in our apparel assortment, which delivered low single-digit comp growth driven by newness in combination with strong everyday value, both in-stores and online. Comps were led by a performance category in the low double-digits as guests loved our latest designs and unbeatable prices in our All in Motion brand. Women's apparel saw growth in the low to mid-single-digits with particular strength in our young contemporary owned brand Wild Fable. And a recent relaunch of our intimate and sleepwear brand, Auden, has seen a strong guest reaction out of the gate, offering high quality and comfortable items at compelling price points, like $15 bras and $20 pajama sets. These results demonstrate the broad-based improvements that we're seeing in apparel, a trend we are eager to build on in the coming quarters and years. While our Home and Hardline trends remain softer than apparel, we've also seen meaningful trend improvement over the last year. In Home, Q2 comps accelerated by more than 7 percentage points compared with the first quarter, and early results in the back to school season are right on plan. Within Home, kitchen continues to stand out, based in part on our recent launch of Figmint, our high-performance kitchenware brand. Within Hardline, while sales and electronics are still under pressure, we've been leaning into other categories with stronger demand, driving a comp trend improvement of around 5 percentage points versus Q1, driven by newness in the category. Key growth areas include our affordable outdoor offerings in many markets, like $1 pool noodles and $10 coolers. Recently, we launched more than 1,000 new items and toys, including over a hundred new items in our own brand Gigglescape, which now includes preschool toys, games, puzzles, and an expansion into plush. And in case there was any question of the love for our brand with young shoppers, some of the fastest growing sales and toys are from Target-themed items, including plush bullseye dogs, kid-sized Target checkout lanes, Target-branded polly pocket toys, Target-branded fisher price little people, and so much more. Beauty continues to gain meaningful market share with comp growth in the high single digits in Q2, driven by a balanced combination of new offerings, celebrity brands, and seasonal relevance. This has been the summer of sun care, with guests looking for familiar, affordable options like up-and-up sunscreen, as well as newer, trending brands such as Vacation. Minis have also been a major growth driver, with travel on the rise and consumers looking for a little bit of affordable indulgence for at home too. In Food, comp sales growth in the low single-digits was led by seasonal moments with hundreds of new items across snacking, grilling and entertaining. With exclusive to target items like Bubly's Melted Ice Pop flavor, which quickly grew to be the highest selling item in its category, we helped guests celebrate summer with fun new flavors and items. In addition to seasonal moments, we've also pushed ourselves to rethink assortment strategies that have been tried and true for years. For example, we transitioned our candy aisles leading into some of the most popular trends like better-for-you options including lower sugar treats and wellness candies. While this category was already growing, these changes raised the bar, accelerating comp growth into the double digits. In Essentials, which also grew in the low single-digits overall, sales growth was largely driven by strength in our health category, where protein drinks, powders, and meal supplements are gaining momentum. Additionally, baby care and essentials continue to do well. Across categories, our own brands grew faster than the total enterprise, showcasing the relevance, quality and value we provide to consumers. In fact, because of our industry-leading design and sourcing capabilities, we are better positioned to remove unnecessary steps in the process, which allows us to reduce costs and increase speed to market. Throughout the second quarter, Target Circle members took advantage of enticing promotions, particularly during our latest Target Circle Week. In fact, this year's Target Circle Week has generated the highest digital traffic of the year so far. As Brian mentioned, we added more than 2 million new Target Circle members in the second quarter while also adding hundreds of thousands of Target Circle cardholders and Target Circle 360 members. Because of the invaluable insights we gained through Target Circle, we were able to offer 4 times more personalized offers as compared to a year ago. And of course, those same insights fuel our Roundel media network, which, as Brian mentioned, continues to benefit our business in multiple ways. While it's hard to believe that summer is already coming to an end, our focus is quickly turning to fall. This, of course, begins with a continuation of our back-to-school and college seasons, which reached their peak in the front half of Q3. More than 70% of our guests shop us during this time frame, and we have plenty in store for them to start the school year off with success and style. Knowing affordability is top of mind for consumers, in many markets this year, we're offering 20 of the most popular school supply items that together are priced under $20, including items like Mondo Llama crayons for just $0.25, notebooks for $0.50 and $5 backpacks. For our college-bound guests, we're offering a 20% discount to get their dorm room stocked, styled and ready for studying. And as we do every year, we're acknowledging the true classroom heroes, our teachers, with a special appreciation event offering an additional 20% off must-have supplies. As the fall season continues, we'll be introducing more and more newness across our assortment to celebrate all things autumn. In our performance category, we're offering new assortments from All in Motion, including our first-ever women's legging destination with new fabrications and a range of colors, sizes and silhouettes to make all bodies look and feel their best. In our women's categories, we're leaning into our fall fashion assortment, which includes wardrobe options anchored in head-to-toe on-trend neutrals and showcasing the disruptive value of core items for just $15. And new this year, we are showing out for the game day in a big way, with mix and match apparel items in your favorite college team colors to show some school spirit in style. Beyond fall fashion, we know consumers are eager for their apple and pumpkin spice favorites, so we're excited to bring back these fall flavors while introducing some new and trending ones as well. Our fall food assortment will offer more than 150 new owned brand items and more than 500 new national brand items, ranging from Pumpkin Donut Holes and Jack-o-Lantern sandwich cookies, to Pecan Pie Ice Cream and Good & Gather turkey stuffing flavored potato chips. From sweet to savory, guests will find all their favorites and be inspired by what will surely become some new favorites too. And while Halloween may seem far away, our consumer research and early season sales suggest there's a lot of excitement around this year's celebrations. Last year, social media was ablaze with videos of our 8-foot all Halloween pumpkin ghoul, Lewis. So we had to bring him back this season along with several new friends, all with their own sassy personalities and catch phrases. We're bringing that own brand love to our custom assortment to. Of course, we're standing to all for all the biggest characters of the season, but we're also seeing an outsized response to our Target branded costumes. And with 75% of the Halloween assortment new this year, we are confident guest will see Target as the Halloween destination for the season. As it turns out, which has come out for more than Halloween, one of the most anticipated films of the year, Universal Pictures' Wicked hits theaters this fall and our assortment will leave guests spellbound with a collection of licensed products that range from toys to apparel to housewares. We have big plans in store, including exclusive items to Target and we'll have more exciting details to share very soon. And of course, we don't have to wait for a changing of the season to change up our assortment. In Beauty, after years of meaningful investments in cosmetics and skincare offerings, we're investing in all things hair care. New from L'Oreal is the biggest innovation in at-home hair coloring in years, Colorsonic. This launch is off to a great start, and we see big things ahead for this brand. And more recently, on top of our exciting launch of Jennifer Aniston's LolaVie hair care line, we launched a new partnership with celebrity, Blake Lively, for her exclusive to Target line, Blake Brown:Hair Care, which quickly became our biggest hair care launch on record. On launch day alone, Blake Brown had the five best-selling hair care items at Target. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I want to express my gratitude to the entire Target team. The past several years have been anything but routine, and this team has handled every change and turn with grace and a commitment to serving the communities in which we operate. Thank you, team Target, for all that you do for our guests and for each other. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Sure. I'd be happy to give a little color commentary to the trends and what's driving those trends. And what we're seeing in discretionary is when we offer on-trend stylish product at a great price, the consumer responds. And we're seeing that in Apparel. Apparel delivered a 3% comp. So real bright spots was All in Motion performance brand, where the team did a fantastic job on fabrication, colors, fit. $25 leggings with a fan favorite and really demonstrated the power of fashion combined with affordability. Beyond that, Beauty is also a standout, where we see news really resonating with the guests. I mentioned in the comments, but it's really exciting to see the success of Blake Lively's new hair care line, Blake Brown. We just launched it a few weeks ago, and it is already the most successful hair care launch that we have ever had a Target. And I think this is another great example of the consumer is willing to buy when they find that right combination of on-trend, stylish product at an affordable price. And even in other businesses, I use Home as an example, consumers want to freshen up their home. They want to freshen up their look, but they need to do it on a budget. So where we see growth is things like candles, decorative accessories, throw pillows. We're seeing growth there because we're offering an inexpensive way to freshen up the look of your home. So again, it goes back to delivering stylish on-trend product at a great price. I'd be happy to offer a little colored commentary on the Food & Beverage business. And as Brian said, we believe there is continued runway for the business to deliver growth, driven by a few things. The first is continued emphasis on affordability. As we talked about, the 5,000 price reductions across everyday items was incredibly well received. We'll continue to lean into value on our Food & Beverage business, not just through everyday pricing, but also through personalized promotions on Circle, as well as with our own brand portfolio, which offers incredible value. The second thing that we'll continue to lean in to drive growth for Food & Beverage will be newness. Just going into the fall season, right now, we have a ton of new products coming, over 150 new and owned brand products, over 500 new national brand products. Leveraging those flavors that everybody loves for the fall. I'm talking about Pumpkin Spice, Apple, Pecan Pie, that will continue to fuel growth. And then the last opportunity to continue to drive growth in our Food & Beverage business is around ease and convenience. Consumers have a lot on their plate, and they're looking for simple solutions, and we're very excited about the continued growth that we're seeing on both Drive Up as well as same-day delivery, which is achieving double-digit growth in Q2, and we continue to see runway on that going forward."

            "content": "Thanks, Rick. I'd like to join Brian in welcoming you to your first earnings call. I'm excited about all of the long-term growth opportunities we have in front of us as we work together to deliver more for our guests, for our team and for our shareholders. As Brian mentioned, I'm temporarily wearing two hats right now as I continue in the CFO role while preparing to fully move in the COO role. And while I'm looking forward to the day when I'm only wearing the COO hat, I'm privileged to be surrounded by exceptionally talented leaders and teams that are operating with a guest-first long-term focus that's fueling our results. Every day, I see their commitment to caring, growing and winning together. Whether I walking a store, a distribution center or the halls in our headquarters, there is no doubt in my mind that our team members are the number one reason that Target is such a special place to work. As we've been highlighting for some time, the operations team is focused on reinforcing retail fundamentals following an extended period of unprecedented volatility that began more than four years ago. While this effort encompasses many processes and metrics, nothing is more important than staying in stock and being reliable for our guests. And while our in-stock measures have been improving rapidly for some time now, we're going to continue our work to improve them even more. In the second quarter, total out of stocks were more than 500 basis points lower than a year ago. Also important, out of stocks on our top items in Q2, the ones with the highest unit velocity, were more than 50% lower than total out of stocks and also better than a year ago. Notably, these out-of-stock measures would have been even more favorable if our perishable food distribution facility in Denton, Texas had not sustained major damage from a severe storm in late May, something I'll return to later in my remarks. It's also notable that our total inventory investment at the end of Q2 was slightly lower than a year ago, meaning that the out-of-stock improvements we've been seeing are the result of operational improvements, not from simply flooding our network with more inventory. Of course, we're always focused on maintaining the right amount of inventory to deliver on our reliability goals, and we're already growing our inventory in categories where demand is strong. But overall, our business has been able to sustain stronger inventory turns than we've seen historically, something you'd expect to happen given the gains in sales per store we've seen over the last five years. Another area of focus for our team is the store shopping experience, most notably in the front end at checkout. With the recent changes we've made to streamline self-checkout, while ensuring we maintain adequate staffing in our full service lanes, we're seeing notably faster checkout times in our self-service lanes. In addition, with more people using our full-service lanes, our team has been engaging with nearly 15% more guests at checkout compared with last year. And with all of these changes, we've seen a continued substantial improvement in our Net Promoter Scores regarding the purchase experience, with scores related to wait times and interactions at checkout the strongest we've seen in six years. We're also making investments in technology to make it easier for our team members to serve our guests. Earlier this year, we integrated GenAI into the handheld devices in our stores, providing our team with rapid access to best practice documentation and the ability to quickly receive straightforward responses to common questions like, how do I sign a guest up for a Target Circle card, and how do I restart the cash register in the event of a power outage. Since the full chain rollout of this new tool, our team members have leveraged the technology more than 50,000 times, giving answers in a highly efficient average chat time of less than one minute. We'll continue to refine this tool over time based on feedback from our team, but many are already telling us that it's enhanced their everyday work experience, making it easier and faster for them to help our guests. In addition, leaders in our stores are telling us they expect this new tool will be particularly helpful as we bring on new permanent and seasonal team members in advance of this year's holiday season, helping them to become more productive, more quickly than in the past. Of course, while well documented, efficient and repeatable processes are critical to maintaining quality in a large operation, it's just as important to help our team to stay nimble and able to react to unforeseen events. And our team had to deal with several weather-related challenges in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our Denton, Texas perishable food distribution center sustained significant physical damage from a storm in late May, resulting in a prolonged site closure and significant product loss at that location. Following the storm, the team reacted quickly to minimize the impact, temporarily realigning perishable food replenishment for 220 locations with other distribution nodes, while our construction and distribution teams rushed to get the facility repaired and operational before the end of the quarter. Later in the quarter, in early July, Hurricane Beryl hit landfall in Southern Texas, and our team responded quickly to help their neighbors in affected communities. When power was lost in multiple locations, our team successfully kept stores open using generators, providing food, supplies and a safe place for community members to take shelter and charge their electronic devices. Our team helped to organize and deliver donations of critical supplies to their neighbors, while helping to clear debris from nearby roads in homes. And as always, our team members took care of each other from cooking meals for displaced colleagues to making sure everyone had access to emergency supplies and shelter. To support these heroic efforts in the field, we maintain a robust infrastructure, supported by a core team at our headquarters that's ready to provide communications and support when disasters happen. As part of these preparations, we reserve and preposition thousands of pallets of critical supplies throughout our distribution network, which can be quickly deployed to affected areas when events occur. We also maintain a command center at our headquarters that's equipped to monitor weather and other conditions in the areas where we operate, helping our field teams to prepare and react quickly to minimize the impact when adverse events affect our communities, colleagues and our business. And of course, we're proud to continue offering financial support in affected communities, having already made proactive donations of $2.5 million so far this year in support of our domestic and global disaster relief partners. Following Hurricane Beryl, our donations helped the American Red Cross stand up more than 10 evacuation centers in Houston. We also supported Team Rubicon as they worked to clear fallen trees, helped homeowners navigate FEMA applications for disaster assistance, aided the footprint project in providing solar generators to power homes and medical machines, and provided food, medicine and other critical supplies to the hardest hit neighborhoods. So much of our Target Forward sustainability strategy is dedicated to working across the business, to address community needs and drive meaningful and positive impact. Through Target's philanthropy and volunteerism, and by integrating business assets to meet the needs of our communities, we aim to be present in ways that help all families thrive, knowing the guests and communities we serve are critical to the success of our business. So, I want to pause and thank our entire team for their tireless efforts, both every day and especially during times of need. You serve as the face of the company in all of the communities where we live and work, and you are the biggest reason consumers love our brand. I'm proud to work with you and grateful for everything you do to support our business, our communities and your fellow team members. So now, I want to pivot and provide a quick update on our sortation center strategy, which continues to benefit our business in multiple ways. A critical aspect of this strategy is faster delivery speeds as local orders processed through a sortation center arrive more than a day faster than our network average. But notably, that increase in speed doesn't require more dollars, as our unit delivery costs from a sort center are about 20% lower than our network average. On top of that direct benefit, opening a sortation center in the market frees up processing space in the stores it serves, while delivering labor savings in those locations as well. With all of these benefits, you can see why we're excited to continue expanding the reach of this capability. And just this month, we're opening our 11th sort center in the Detroit market, where it's expected to serve more than 3 million consumers. By 2028, this facility is expected to process up to 60,000 packages daily while operating in a smaller-than-average footprint. And beyond growth in the number of these facilities, our existing sort centers continue to ramp up their capacity, and we're finding new ways to integrate them into our broader network. For example, our recently opened sort center in Chicago will be feeding the Detroit sortation center, increasing the number of packages eligible for next-day delivery in that market. Altogether this year, our sortation centers have processed 19% more packages than a year ago. So, now I want to turn to our second quarter financial results. As Brian highlighted earlier, the 2% increase in our Q2 comp sales was driven entirely by traffic. This traffic increase was partially offset by a decline in average ticket, which included a decrease in our average selling price when compared with a year ago. As Brian mentioned, our guests continue to shop around seasonal moments, leading to strength around the Memorial Day holiday as well as the Fourth of July and our most recent Target Circle Week later in the quarter. Within the quarter, comp sales were strongest in June and July, and trends were very similar between those two months on a reported basis. Most importantly, traffic grew in all three months of the quarter. Beyond our comp sales, second quarter total revenue growth of 2.7% reflected the benefit from sales in non-mature stores and double-digit growth in other revenue, driven primarily by strong growth in our Roundel ad business. Our second quarter gross margin rate of 28.9% was about 190 basis points higher than a year ago. About 90 basis points of this improvement was driven by our merchandising strategies, which included the ongoing benefit of our efficiency work. We also saw about 40 basis points of benefit from category sales mix, which was largely offset by cost pressures from digital fulfillment and supply chain. Finally, our gross margin rate reflected about 90 basis points of benefit from lower inventory shrink, compared with a 20 basis point benefit in the first quarter. While our guidance assumes that the year-over-year benefit from shrink would increase this quarter, we've seen better-than-expected results in our most recent store inventory counts, resulting in a bigger-than-expected financial benefit in Q2. Based on these updated accounts, we're now expecting our Q3 gross margin rate will also benefit from lower shrink costs, but expect the magnitude of that benefit will be less than half of what we just experienced in the second quarter. And for Q4, given the financial benefit we were already seeing a year ago, we're expecting shrink costs will be approximately flat to last year. While it's encouraging to see this progress, we'll continue our work to move shrink rates down to more sustainable levels in the years ahead, given the steep increase in shrink that our business has absorbed over the last five years. Our second quarter SG&A expense rate of 21.2% was about 30 basis points higher than a year ago. This increase reflected cost increases in multiple parts of our business, along with continued investments in our team, which were partially offset by lower remodel expenses, savings from our efficiency work and continued disciplined cost management throughout the enterprise. Overall, our Q2 operating margin rate of 6.4% was about 160 basis points higher than last year as we continue to build back our profitability from the significant headwinds we've encountered over the last couple of years. Regarding our inventory, we continue to feel good about our position. As I mentioned earlier, Q2 ending inventory on the balance sheet was slightly lower than a year ago. However, given all of the volatility we've experienced since the pandemic began, one-year comparisons can be hard to interpret. As such, we still find it useful to compare relative growth rates back to 2019. And if you perform that comparison for the second quarter, you'll see that both our sales and ending inventory have grown about 38% over those five years, reinforcing our view that we're positioned appropriately as we enter the back half of the year. Now, I'd like to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our long-standing priorities. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Next, we look to support the dividend and build on our more than 50-year record of increasing the annual dividend. And finally, we look to return any excess cash that's available after these first two uses by engaging in share repurchases over time within the limits of our late credit ratings. Regarding the first priority, we've allocated $1.3 billion to capital expenditures through the first half of the year and continue to expect full year CapEx in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. Regarding the second priority, we returned $509 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in Q2, representing growth of about $10 million over last year. And finally, we returned to share repurchases in the second quarter, allocating $155 million to retire 1.1 million shares of our stock. Given the work of our team to strengthen our balance sheet over the last 18 months and the simultaneous improvements we've seen in our profitability and cash flow, we were happy to get back to repurchases this quarter. We expect to have continued repurchase capacity in the back half of 2024 and in years ahead. So now, I want to end my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital, which is an important measure of the quality of both our financial results and our capital investments. Through the 12 months ending in the second quarter, our after-tax ROIC of 16.6% was nearly 3 percentage points higher than a year ago. While this is already a very strong after-tax return, our long-term financial plans envision continued growth of this metric into the high teens over time. Now, I'd like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. And while our performance has exceeded our expectations so far this year and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high. Against that backdrop, our experience over the last several years has shown us that a prudent outlook, while maintaining the team's agility, is the best way to position our business. As such, we've taken a measured approach to our forward-looking guidance, and our team remains ready to respond if the pace of our business turns out to be stronger. With these considerations as context, we're planning for third quarter comparable sales growth in the 0% to 2% range, and GAAP and adjusted EPS of $2.10 to $2.40. And while our full year comp guidance range remains the same at 0% to 2% growth and the breadth of possibilities remains quite wide, our baseline plan for the fall season would put us in the lower half of that range for the full year. However, in light of the strong financial performance our business has already delivered in the first half of the year, we've raised our full year GAAP and adjusted EPS range to $9 to $9.70 compared with our prior range of $8.60 to $9.60. At our Financial Community Meeting earlier this year, we provided insight into our financial aspirations over the next 10 years. At their core, those aspirations are based on two basic assumptions, healthy growth on the top line and reaching the appropriate level of profitability on the bottom line. In the second quarter, in an environment where consumers are focused on value and making tough trade-offs in their spending decisions, our team delivered newness, value and reliability to our guests, resulting in top line growth beyond our baseline expectations and even faster growth in guest traffic. And importantly, even in a challenging environment, we also expanded our Q2 operating margin rate. We are really proud of these results, which reflect the hard work and dedication of our outstanding team. At the same time, this quarter was only the first step on a much longer journey and we have a lot more work ahead of us. More specifically, with 2019 as a baseline, the second quarter was the first time in a while in which our EPS grew faster than the top line, with total revenue growth of 38% over that five-year period and EPS growth of more than 41%. Our guidance for the remainder of the year implies further expansion of both of those metrics. And based on our growth initiatives, ongoing efficiency work and continued opportunity to reduce the impact of inventory shrink, we expect to see additional progress in the years ahead. We have a clear vision of how we're going to get there and the right team in place to make it happen. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Thanks for the question, Kate. I think the headline is at the start of your question, we see a consumer that's largely consistent with how we would have described the consumer over the last couple of quarters. Consumer that's been resilient overall in their spending and flat in spite of significant inflation over the last couple of years, a consumer that's choiceful. And so our combination of getting newness and value right in the second quarter led to the performance that was at the top end of our expectations. As we look at the balance of the year, we've got more of the year in front of us than is behind us, and we think it's prudent to take a measured review against the kind of consumer behaviors we'll be watching over the balance of the year. But importantly, that guidance is still centered on growth. We expect to continue to grow in Q3. We expect to have a growth story for the year. And you can see us playing offense appropriately against that goal, but being measured in our outlook. We think that's the right way to position the business. Yeah, thanks for the question, Rupesh. As we laid out at the start of the year, this year was going to be about progress to that better margin performance over time, and two quarters in, I just can't thank the team enough for their work to put us solidly on the path of the improvement that we laid out for the year. If you unpacked the quarter, I hit on some of this in my remarks, but it always starts with the top line. So, to grow the top line at a 2% comp, to see a category like apparel, so we like the margins in apparel, to see that category return to growth helped us from a mix perspective. Great work by the team to continue to find efficiency within the business. And we expected a more promotional environment this year. We've certainly seen that so far, but you can see the strength on the margin line due to the team's really hard work to continue to squeeze efficiencies out of the business in ways big and small. And we're pleased with the progress we're making on shrink. Now, there's some noise quarter to quarter about how that will come through. So I tried to unpack some of those details in my prepared remarks. But the net punchline there is we're ahead of where we expected to be in terms of progress on shrink too. So all of that's adding up to an earnings result we're certainly pleased with. And our work going forward will be to continue that momentum in Q3 and Q4. Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. There's a lot that goes into that margin line on any quarter. And so the headlines are some we've touched on a little bit already. We've definitely seen a more promotional environment. But against that backdrop, the teams have worked hard to find efficiencies within the business. And that can show up in ways big and small. To give a tangible example, one of the things that we've continued to see progress with is -- the most expensive thing we do in fulfilling product is shipping a brown box, and we've seen significant improvement in the cost per unit of that activity, as teams have worked to better align inventory with where we see demand. So we have to split shipments frequently. And the core productivity within those processes, big improvements in our stores team, delivering that product more efficiently as we pick and pack in the stores, and so that work adds up. And the teams have been at it for multiple quarters now, and we're seeing it pay off. Yeah. Importantly, Robby, I'll kind of take your second point first. We're really pleased with our Circle 360 same-day delivery business, both it and Drive Up grew in the low teens. And so we've seen some acceleration in that business on the heels of our relaunch of Circle, and so we're encouraged by that. And importantly, for both of those services, we've talked about this before, but I think it warrants a reemphasis. The thing we see when people engage with Drive Up and with Circle 360 same-day delivery is they spend meaningfully more at Target in total, and their in-store shopping actually increases after they become users of those services. And so, we continue to watch that relationship closely and growth of those services means growth in our share of wallet with the consumers that use those services. Speaking to Circle more specifically, and I believe your question was focused on Circle card penetration, we see that opportunity over time with the relaunch of Circle to bring some investment back to growing our card business. One of the things that, that relaunch of Circle provides is it brings the core base Circle program, where guests can find incredible value through the personalized offers that they receive every day; with the Circle card program, where you can save an extra 5% if you're a Circle card member; with Circle 360 program, if you want the best of Target brought to your doorstep. And the integration of those programs, we think, provides a good jumping off point over time to continue to reinvigorate the Circle card business, but that's going to be a journey of quarters and years."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 22, 2024. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nJohn Hulbert: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. \n On the line with me today are Brian Cornell, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Christina Hennington, Chief Growth Officer; and Michael Fiddelke, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Brian, Christina and Michael will provide their insights on our first quarter performance, along with our outlook and priorities for the second quarter and remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session. \n This morning, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via webcast. Following the call, Michael and I will be available to answer your follow-up questions.  \n And finally, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described in this morning's earnings press release and in our most recently filed 10-K. \n Also in these remarks, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP numbers to the most directly comparable GAAP number are included in this morning's press release, which is posted on our Investor Relations website.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his thoughts on the first quarter and his priorities for the second quarter and beyond. Brian? \nBrian Cornell: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. \n At our Financial Committee meeting in March, we outlined our long-term vision for profitable growth and a broad range of investments we're making to support those ambitions. We talked about our goal to open more than 300 new stores over the next decade as we continue investing in the vast majority of our existing stores. We discussed the supply chain investments we're making to modernize how we distribute merchandise, including the rollout of additional sortation centers to increase the speed and efficiency of our last-mile delivery.  \n We highlighted investments in technology, including AI and machine learning, to make it easier and more reliable for our team to serve guests in every channel. We previewed the relaunch of our loyalty ecosystem, making it simpler and easier for us to deliver even more value to our guests. We outlined changes to the digital experience and our focus on bringing the joy of discovery to the digital channel, just like we've done in our stores for years. \n We highlighted the value of Roundel, our advertising business, which helps us deepen the connection between Target, our guests and our vendors. Roundel is already making a meaningful contribution to our performance, and it's the fastest-growing part of our business.  \n We talked about the value of Target's unique multi-category assortment, including the launch of new owned brands like Figmint and dealworthy, and our work to widen the footprint of national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty. And we discussed our commitment to making continued investments in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and more, because we know when we take care of our team, they can focus on taking care of our guests. \n Also in March, we provided our financial guidance for 2024, a year in which we expect Target to get back to growth and build on the enormous gains in guest engagement and top line sales we've seen over the last 5 years. And today, with the first quarter behind us, I'm happy to report we're firmly on track to deliver on that guidance. More specifically, our first quarter comp sales were just above the midpoint of our guidance range, and our Q1 EPS was near the upper end of our expectations. \n And I'll quickly note, while we're not yet satisfied with our current top line performance and we're far short to where we expect to operate over time, we've seen a sustained improvement in multiple business drivers over the last several quarters. This reinforces our confidence that we're moving in the right direction, and we're on track to deliver on our longer-term vision. \n As we continue to monitor the external environment, our view of the U.S. consumer remains the same, as we shared 3 months ago. More specifically, U.S. consumers continue to exhibit a high degree of resilience in the face of multiple challenges, including a rapid rise in prices and interest rates over the last few years. \n In addition, business trends continue to reflect a normalization in spending patterns that first emerged more than 2 years ago, a pattern where consumers are remixing their spending back into services and entertainment outside of their homes after curtailing those activities during the pandemic. This normalization, combined with the cumulative impact of higher prices on consumer budgets, is resulting in continued soft trends in discretionary categories, most notably in Home and Hardlines. \n And today, even as price levels remain high, inflation rates have moderated significantly over the last few quarters. And we've seen a meaningful improvement in discretionary trends, most notably in Apparel, where our performance improved by approximately 4 percentage points in Q1 when compared with last year's fourth quarter. This gives us some optimism that we could see a better balance of spending between discretionary and frequency categories in the years ahead.  \n However, given that we're facing continued uncertainty in the near term, our team remains focused on operational excellence and the agility to respond quickly to changes in the environment. In addition, we're focused on delivering newness to our guests and leaning into seasonal moments, both of which have long served as hallmarks of our brand.  \n Among the highlights in Q1, we were really pleased with the response to our limited-time partnership with the iconic designer, Diane von Furstenberg; and the assortment of pickleball equipment and apparel we offered in partnership with the athletic brand, Prince. Of course, beyond newness and seasons, we continue to focus on delivering unbeatable value to our guests. While our team is always committed to value, it's particularly important in today's environment as consumers look for ways they can stretch their budgets in the face of suddenly high prices.  \n To help our guests in the face of these pressures, this week, we announced that we've made price cuts on 1,500 frequently shopped items in many markets, and we're planning additional price cuts on 1,000 more items this summer. These cuts are focused on everyday items in our Food and Essential categories and are designed to help our guests make the most of their budgets. Collectively, they'll save our guests millions of dollars this summer. \n But low prices are only one of the many ways we deliver value. Another way is through our Target Circle loyalty program, which we relaunched in April. At well over 100 million members, Target Circle is already one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States. And we've redesigned the program to deliver even more value while making it easier to use and understand. \n More specifically, we integrated our credit and debit card programs along with same-day delivery capabilities under a single umbrella, allowing our guests to choose from a range of services and rewards based on their needs and preferences. Christina will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we are really pleased with the consumer response we've seen so far. Most notably, we added more than 1 million new members to Target Circle in the quarter, and we're committed to making sustained investment in this program over the next few years.  \n I want to pause and thank our team for making this relaunch a success. It required a remarkable degree of collaboration and communication across a huge swath of our team, including marketing, stores, digital, financial services, merchandising, technology and finance teams. \n In addition to value, our team is focused on convenience and reliability, including through the digital channel where trends have improved meaningfully over the last few quarters. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in digital sales for the first time in more than a year. This growth was driven by our same-day services, Drive Up, in-store pickup and same-day delivery, which has been rapidly embraced by our guests in recent years.  \n In the first quarter, our same-day services saw high single-digit growth over last year, led by Drive Up, which grew in the low teens. This builds on the explosive growth of Drive Up that occurred during the pandemic, which was followed by double-digit increases in both 2022 and 2023. All together and more than $2 billion in Q1, Drive Up sales were more than 30x larger than we saw in the first quarter of 2019.  \n I want to pause and highlight the outstanding efforts of our operations teams to enhance the guest experience. As Michael will cover in a few minutes, their focus on retail fundamentals is delivering multiple benefits, ranging from better in-stocks to rising guest satisfaction. And of course, our results continue to highlight the benefit of our stores and sub-model, which offers speed, reliability and efficiency regardless of how our guests choose to shop. In the first quarter, our stores fulfilled nearly 98% of our total sales as we relied on our store assets, inventory and team to support every one of them in services we provide. \n So now as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take note of how our businesses evolved over time, providing perspective that allows us to look beyond the volatility we've seen in recent years. In the first quarter of 2024, our business generated over $24.5 billion in revenue. That represents growth of just under $7 billion or 39% compared with the first quarter of 2019, the year before the pandemic began. \n We've also seen healthy growth on the bottom line where our business delivered EPS of $2.03 in Q1, which is $0.50 or 33% higher than in 2019. While that pace of bottom line growth is somewhat slower than we've seen on the top line and below what we'd expect to see over time, it reflects some unique profit rate pressures that we faced during the period, a portion of which we expect to offset over the next several years. \n As we look ahead to the remainder of 2024, our team is focused on getting back to top line growth. We expect that will begin in the second quarter as we build on the remarkable gains we've seen over time. Like the U.S. consumer, our team has shown remarkable resilience during an extended period of exceptional volatility. I'm incredibly proud and appreciative of the passion they demonstrate for our guests and for our brand and their strong desire to win in the marketplace. Our team has long been the key to Target's success, and they are the #1 reason I remain confident in our ability to grow profitably in the years ahead.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, while we are pleased that our first quarter results came in largely as expected, we won't be satisfied until we start growing again, which is our expectation beginning with the second quarter. \n Before I share the strategy and plans that we expect to fuel this growth in Q2 and beyond, I want to spend a bit of time reinforcing what Brian shared regarding our views of the U.S. consumer and economy as well as providing some additional color on our first quarter results.  \n Our view on the consumer remains largely consistent with our view 3 months ago. Consumers remain surprisingly resilient despite a challenging backdrop of significantly elevated prices compared to just a few years ago. And even as inflation moderates and we see sequential improvement in discretionary category trends, higher interest rates, uncertainty around the future of the economy, continued social and political divisiveness and the upcoming election cycle have consumers concerned about what lies ahead. In fact, consumer confidence took a meaningful dip in April despite a strong job market and normalizing inflation.  \n And beyond the psychological toll of the current environment, the sustained level of elevated prices has had a meaningful impact on budgets and savings for many families. Currently, 1 in 3 Americans has maxed out or is nearing the limit on at least one of their credit cards. For these reasons and more, we remain cautious in our near-term growth outlook. Notably, we expect discretionary trends will continue to remain pressured in the short term, but to normalize over time.  \n Turning to our first quarter results, comparable sales were down 3.7%, driven largely by continued softness in Home and Hardlines categories and softening trends in frequency categories, with lower unit volume and less benefit from price as compared to a year ago. Amidst the pressure, Beauty continues to be a standout category, delivering growth in the low single digits in the quarter. This growth was led by continued strength in Ulta Beauty at Target as well as strong performance in personal care and skincare categories.  \n Apparel, while down low single digits for the quarter, saw a nearly 4 percentage point improvement in comparable sales from Q4. The performance in young contemporary categories delivered comps in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, with guests responding favorably to our new spring fashion sets, new offerings within All in Motion owned brands and our limited-time partnership with Diane von Furstenberg. In fact, our collaboration with DVF was one of the strongest limited-time partnerships we've had in years, driving millions of unique visits to our site daily during launch week and increasing basket size by around 15% on average. This partnership demonstrates our continued ability to bring fashion to all with incredible style and value.  \n Frequency categories saw comparable sales declines in the low single digits. Seasonal moments continue to outperform overall trends in frequency categories, particularly in Food & Beverage. And we saw strong performance in both Valentine's Day and Easter time frames. Sales in Home and Hardlines continue to be soft, though there were notable bright spots in both areas. In Home, the team has found ways to reduce costs in select Home categories, and we passed those savings along to guests. This has led to an acceleration in unit velocity in these categories. \n In Hardlines, the entertainment category grew high single digits, reflecting notable strength from our exclusive offerings of Taylor Swift's latest album release, The Tortured Poets Department. With an exclusive-to-Target version of the album and 3 exclusive CD options, this was the strongest music preorder in our history, elevated by in-store events, including fun photo-ops for the most hardcore Swifties out there as well as the strong presence of our Taylor exclusive on her social channels.  \n In the Sporting Goods category, our exclusive-to-Target partnership with Prince delivered incredible sales momentum in all things pickleball. Beyond the quality and value of this line's equipment and gear, guests are loving the apparel offerings in the line as well. Across our sales channels, sales were the strongest in digital where first quarter comparable sales grew 1.4%. This was driven largely by continued growth in our same-day services as well as meaningful improvement in our Apparel business this quarter.  \n At our Financial Community Meeting in March, Cara and I shared details about changes we've made to our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle. And while it is still very early, we're encouraged by the reaction to our April relaunch of Target Circle. In Q1, we added more than 1 million new Target Circle members with strong engagement across all 3 levels of the platform. Our guests tell us they find the program easier to use, appreciate the clarity of the promotions offered and understand the value provided with their membership.  \n Social sentiment is up compared to a year ago, and mentions of Target Circle on social platforms increased by more than 500% versus last year, boosted by our immensely popular marketing campaign featuring Saturday Night Live alum, Kristen Wiig, revisiting her role as the Target Lady. \n In addition to these memorable ads, guests are responding to the automatic application of Target Circle deals when they shop, giving them confidence that they are always getting the best deal on every Target run. Plus, strike-through pricing on Target.com and our app helps guests to clearly see the value they're receiving on those offers. We believe that pricing and value transparency will only become more important with time and that we can continue to grow awareness of the great value we offer across our assortment. \n And while these enhancements drive performance in both our stores and digital channels, our most recent Target Circle Week in April drove outsized benefit to our digital performance. In fact, Q1 Target Circle Week drove the highest traffic to our website and app that we've seen in the past year outside of the Q4 holiday season. In addition, of the Target Circle members who shopped us during Target Circle Week, more than 3/4 redeemed an offer. We're very encouraged by the strong response, and we are just getting started. \n Beyond Target Circle, our team's work to remodel our digital platforms is paying multiple dividends. Newly developed generative AI and personalization capabilities are expanding scope and reach of what we can offer our guests in terms of product recommendations, search results and more. We recently engaged in a pilot with one of our biggest vendors to test our latest personalization capabilities with guests shopping our personal care categories. We're very encouraged by early test results, which showed a nearly 3x lift in conversion rates from personalized promotions versus mass offers, including higher sales lift across the rest of the category as well.  \n In addition to driving more personalization, we're also focused on growing relevance, particularly where there may be opportunities in our current online assortment. As we shared previously, we think our digital marketplace, Target Plus, will play an outsized role in our growth in the quarters and years to come, even as we continue to prioritize the curation of both our assortment and digital partners on the platform. In the past year, we've more than doubled the number of partners and products hosted on Target Plus. We are excited to expand offerings with current partners and introduce new brands to the platform in Q2 and beyond.  \n As we've been saying for years now, the lines between physical and digital shopping continue to blur across retail, and we're taking an industry-leading position to minimize the distinction further. In fact, we view digital as more than just a sales channel. It's also the connective tissue across most of our transactions. Around half of guests that open the Target app on a given day make in-store purchases with us that same day. \n Guests look to our digital platforms for inspiration, helping to plan their next in-store Target run. They use the app while in our stores to check prices, compare products and even navigate our stores more seamlessly. And whether they are choosing to walk through our physical or digital front door, we want to provide the inspiring and welcoming Target experience our guests expect from us.  \n Beyond stores and digital, we're exploring new ways to grow the business outside of these traditional channels. Back in March, we launched a new wholesale collaboration with Canadian retailer, Hudson's Bay, bringing our iconic Cat & Jack's kids apparel brand to Canadian families in its stores and online. The launch is off to a great start with Hudson's Bay customers buying more kids apparel each shopping trip, leading to a 15% increase in their basket size, and Cat & Jack T-shirts and dresses among the top-selling pieces. \n We're already expanding the collection with even more Cat & Jack items that they'll love in categories like swim, outerwear and shoes to keep driving traffic and sales. While it's still early, we're excited about the success of this launch and exploring additional opportunities to bring the love of Target's owned brands to new markets and retail partners.  \n Now let's turn our attention to our expectations for the second quarter. Summer is a time for family and friends, enjoying the beautiful outdoors and embracing adventures near and far. Q2 represents more than half of the year's spend on travel gear, and we have all the must-haves at great prices. From our only-at-Target Open Story owned brand of packing cubes, luggage and more to this summer's hottest books for the airplane and the beach, we have you covered no matter where and how you travel.  \n For the outdoor explorer, we are excited about our latest offerings in our owned brand, Embark, designed to celebrate family time in the great outdoors. Whether roughing it or glamping is your style, our assortment of tents, shelters, sleeping bags, camping chairs and more provide functionality, quality and value for those with a bit of wanderlust. And for those looking to celebrate at home, we have the must-haves for every occasion, from this summer's backyard pool parties to the greatest red, white and blue fashion to celebrate the Fourth of July in style.  \n As Brian mentioned earlier, value remains a top priority for consumers, and we recently reduced prices of more than 1,500 items across our assortment in many markets. In this summer, that list will grow to nearly 5,000 frequently shopped items, all at new lower prices. We also took a hard look at some of the most popular products from last year's summer assortment and reduced retail on a wide range of items, including season-locked deals like $1 pool noodles, $5 pool floats and $15 coolers. Plus, guests can save even more every day when they add personalized promotions available through Target Circle and 5% off every purchase with the Target Circle Card.  \n And of course, our only-at-Target owned-brand offerings deliver unmatched value for our guests, providing the perfect blend of great out-the-door pricing and incredible quality. And just in time for the neighborhood grill-out, we are bringing an abundance of new food offerings through our Good & Gather and Favorite Day owned brands. With more than 125 new items hitting shelves, plus exclusive flavors of hot national brands like bubly sparkling water and poppi, we expect to be included in a whole lot of barbecues this summer.  \n But summer always goes by quickly. And before we know it, guests will shift their focus from fun in the sun to preparing for a return to school and college. Our brand stands tall for families, so it is no surprise that around 70% of our guests shop in our Back-to-School and Back-to-College categories. And this year, we are going bigger than ever in that critical season. Our goal is to help guests celebrate the joy of going back to school wherever and whenever they want to shop, delivering an easy and convenient omnichannel shopping experience surrounded by relevant and new products at unbeatable value.  \n Before I turn things over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams for yet another quarter of tirelessly supporting our guests, our shareholders and each other. Although they make it look easy, managing in the current environment is anything but straightforward, and it is their passion and talent that allows us to drive great interactions with our guests to keep inventory lean and yet improve our in-stock positions and set us up quarter after quarter to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks, Christina. As Brian highlighted earlier, we take a long-term approach when making investments in our business with a focus on delighting consumers and our guests both today and in the years ahead. This approach has led to outstanding financial performance over the long term, and we're confident it will continue to serve us well in the months and years ahead. And today, as I step into my new role as COO, I'm bringing this long-term perspective with me as I work with my new team to invest in a reliable and differentiated guest experience.  \n In support of that experience, over the last 5 quarters, our team has done an outstanding job of maintaining appropriate inventory levels aligned with sales trends in each of our categories. This discipline has led to a notably leaner inventory position overall and, most importantly, much better in-stocks as well. Those improvements continued in the first quarter across multiple measures of reliability. \n A key indicator of this progress is our overall in-stock position, which improved by more than 3 percentage points versus the prior quarter and even more when compared with the year ago. While this broad measure is critically important, the team also drills down into far more granular metrics, allowing them to focus on the biggest opportunities for improvement. \n For example, our top item in-stock measure focuses on the 1/3 of our assortment that turns most quickly, and we've seen impressive progress on this measure in recent quarters. More specifically, in Q1, the out-of-stock rate on this group of top items was less than half of what we're seeing overall, having improved by more than 4 percentage points when compared with a year ago.  \n We also had in-stock measures for our highest-volume stores and our small-format stores, both of which faced unique operating challenges. We also carefully measure in-stocks on our new store portfolio to ensure we make a strong first impression when we open in new neighborhoods. And we focus on our seasonal programs given the limited time window in which those assortments are offered. I'm happy to report that our team delivered improvements in each of these in-stock measures in Q1, enabling the overall improvement I highlighted earlier.  \n A critical factor supporting our reliability is the upstream supply chain where we've been seeing improvements as well. These include the new upstream distribution facilities we've opened over the last couple of years, which have been seeing improvements in their own reliability measures even as they continue to ramp their throughput. \n We've also seen improvements through continued collaboration with our vendor partners where we're approaching pre-pandemic levels of reliability regarding inbound shipments arriving on time and in full. Given the importance of reliability to our guests, these measures should always remain a primary focus for our team. While we're proud of our recent progress, we know we have more room to improve, and we're committed to extending these gains in the quarters and years ahead.  \n Beyond product availability, our store teams continue to focus on retail fundamentals and operational excellence, ensuring we maintain best practices, particularly when it comes to the guest experience. One change we recently implemented was the decision to limit the number of items at self-checkout in our stores nationwide. This decision was made after rigorous testing last year and is intended to ensure our team can provide the best possible experience at both our full-service checkout lanes and also at self-checkout. As a result, when we made the recent change in our self-checkout lanes, we also engaged with our store teams across the country to ensure they are consistently providing adequate staffing at our full-service lanes.  \n With these recent changes and consistent with results from last year's test, we've seen a rapid rise in guest satisfaction scores relating to both wait times and the quality of interactions with our team at checkout. For both of these metrics, average scores in the first quarter were higher than a year ago, and we saw increases in these metrics between the beginning and the end of the quarter as well. \n We're also pleased with the guest response to our most recently launched Drive Up services, namely the ability for guests to get their favorite Starbucks items with their Drive Up order and the option to make a return from the Drive Up lane. While we received high satisfaction scores across all of our same-day services, returns received the highest rating of any service we provide. And notably, the Net Promoter Score for Drive Up returns moved even higher in the first quarter, exceeding the sky-high score this service was receiving a year ago. \n And finally, I want to highlight the entire team's effort to support the relaunch of Target Circle in early April with a special shout-out to our store team. From the installation of compelling new signing throughout every sales floor across the country and the focus on providing an engaging experience for guests who wanted to better understand our new program, our team did an outstanding job preparing for and supporting the launch of this new program. And while it's only one of many ways to measure its success, I'm really proud of our team's role in signing up more than 1 million new Target Circle members in the first quarter. \n Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. On the top line in Q1, total sales declined 3.2%, reflecting a 3.7% decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the impact of our new stores. Among the drivers of our comparable sales, traffic was down 1.9% in the first quarter. The average transaction was also down 1.9% as consumers continue to spend cautiously, particularly in discretionary categories. \n Total revenue was down 3.1% in the quarter, reflecting a 3.9% increase in other revenue. Among the components of other revenue, a decline in credit card profit sharing was offset primarily by the benefit of more than 20% growth in our Roundel ad business, along with increases in several smaller items, including revenue from Target Plus. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate was about 140 basis points higher than last year. About 1 percentage point of this improvement was in merchandising where we continue to benefit from favorable freight rates and other cost savings, which offset higher promotional markdown rate. Also in Q1, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from category mix and 20 basis points of benefit from inventory shrink. \n As I mentioned at our Financial Community Meeting in March, we've been encouraged to see a growing focus on retail theft at the federal, state and local levels, and we continue to take our own steps to reduce theft in our stores. Based on our recent physical inventory counts, we continue to believe that shrink rates are positioned to reach a plateau this year. And in Q1, the results of those inventory counts were favorable versus our expectations. \n As a result, we now expect to see a full year gross margin rate benefit related to shrink, most notably in the second quarter. While this improvement will serve as only a small first step in offsetting the significant headwind we faced in recent years, we're encouraged to see this metric moving in the right direction. \n On the SG&A line, we saw a rate increase of about 130 basis points in the first quarter, reflecting the deleveraging effect of a decline in sales, combined with the impact of multiple cost increases, including compensation and benefits for our team and higher marketing expense to support the launch of Target Circle. \n On the D&A line, we saw a rate increase of about 20 basis points over last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales, along with an increase in dollars driven by a number of recently completed capital projects. Altogether, we're pleased that our operating margin rate was up slightly from a year ago despite a decline in sales. \n Our enterprise efficiency efforts played a key role in this outcome, resulting in savings throughout our P&L. These savings helped to offset continued investments in our team and pressure from year-over-year investments in promotions and marketing. While these efficiency efforts were broad-based, they included work within merchandising to implement changes in owned-brand sourcing and design, resulting in lower product costs and other savings. \n They also included work that delivered productivity gains across our general merchandise and food distribution networks, improvements in middle-mile fill rates and changes within our last-mile delivery capability to optimize units per package and save on delivery costs. And while there's much more opportunity in front of us, the team is already making progress in reducing complexity on the apparel floor pad and the back rooms of our stores, reducing the cost of digital fulfillment while making our team more efficient overall. \n As I mentioned earlier, we continue to feel really good about our inventory position, which was 7% lower than a year ago, even as we continue to benefit from the in-stock improvements I already covered. When we look back to the first quarter of 2019, total inventory has increased about 30% over those 5 years, while sales in the quarter just ended were about 39% higher than in 2019. Given that this growth in sales was largely driven by an increase in our sales per store, an increase in our inventory turns is something we'd expect to see and something that should be sustainable over time. \n Now I want to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our priorities, which have been consistent for several decades. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support our dividend and build on our decades-long record of annual dividend growth. And finally, we deploy excess cash to repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Regarding the first priority, first quarter CapEx was just under $700 million, and we remain on track to invest a total of $3 billion to $4 billion for the full year. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, up about 2% from a year ago. Later this quarter, we plan to recommend that our Board approve a small increase in the quarterly dividend in support of our goal to build on our decades-long record of annual dividend increases and move toward a 40% payout ratio over time. \n Regarding the third priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in the first quarter, consistent with the expectation I shared at our Financial Community Meeting. As I mentioned at that time, we focused on strengthening our balance sheet throughout 2023 and saw a rapid recovery in our debt metrics. And as I also mentioned that day, given our expectation for Target's financial performance for the remainder of 2024, we may have the ability to resume share repurchase activity later this year while maintaining our debt ratings at the middle A level. \n Now I'll close my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q1, our business delivered an after-tax ROIC of 15.4%, up from 11.4% a year ago. An after-tax return of 15% is strong performance relative to our industry, and we expect to see continued growth in this metric into the high teens over time. \n Now I want to turn to our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales increase in the 0% to 2% range. While this is below the growth rate we'd expect to deliver over time, it reflects the continued cautious approach to our near-term outlook, which has served us well in recent quarters. \n On the bottom line in Q2, we're guiding to a range of $1.95 to $2.35. The midpoint of this EPS range represents a growth rate of approximately 20% over last year as we continue to build on the profit rate expansion we've seen over the last few quarters. For the full year, we're maintaining our prior guidance for a comparable sales increase in the 0% to 2% range and EPS of $8.60 to $9.60. We believe these ranges continue to properly capture the range of scenarios we're contemplating given how the environment and our business has progressed so far this year. \n Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to thank the team for their continued energy and dedication in what continues to be a very complicated environment. While I'm still digging into my new role leading operations, I've been inspired and impressed by our team's passion, ingenuity and strong desire to win together. Even as they continue to navigate the near term with agility, the team is also keeping an eye firmly on the future and thinking about how Target will be operating in 1, 3, 5 or even 10 years from now. It's energizing work, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve alongside this amazing team. \n Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian. \nBrian Cornell: Before we turn to your questions, I want to recap what we've covered today, including our view of our business, the environment and both our near-term and long-term prospects. \n Our view of the consumer and the environment remains the same as 90 days ago, and we're pleased that Q1 results were firmly in line with our expectations. While we won't be satisfied until we return to growth, we're encouraged by the meaningful progress we've seen in recent quarters. \n These positive indicators include improving top line trends, resumption of digital growth in the first quarter, led by double-digit growth in Drive Up, continued growth in our Beauty category and a meaningful improvement in our Apparel comp in Q1. These trends reinforce our confidence that we're on the right track and positioned to get back to growth in Q2.  \n Our team is doing an outstanding job in a complicated environment, planning prudently while staying agile and responsive. Our guests are responding to newness throughout our assortment and continuing to turn to us as they celebrate important seasonal moments. They appreciate our focus on value, and they're responding well to recent innovations in our loyalty offering and fulfillment services. They're also responding to continuous improvements in our shopping experience as our team doubles down on retail fundamentals like convenience and reliability. \n At the same time, we're continuing to invest in the long term in new stores and existing stores, the digital shopping experience, our multi-category assortment, supply chain, technology and our rapidly growing Roundel ad business. And we're exploring new opportunities, including the potential to expand the scale and reach of our owned brands through wholesaling arrangements in markets we don't currently serve. And of course, we're continuing to focus on our team, on their pay, benefits, training and development, because they're the #1 differentiator of our brand. \n And our efficiency efforts are providing extra fuel for all of these investments. As the team delivers incremental savings, based on the rapid growth we've seen over the last half decade, they've created additional capacity within our P&L to support robust investments in our business while also delivering stronger profitability over the last several quarters. These elements position us for continued progress over the remainder of the year and for profitable growth over time. \n With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Now Michael, Christina and I will be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: So my first question is, I guess, bigger picture on 2024. We talked about, I think, leaning into top line growth. Can you talk about the balance of margin and top line growth that you initially sought for '24? Are you finding that you're beginning to lean more in terms of driving the business, the cost of that to drive the sales a little more? Or are there just puts and takes and levers that you had all along that we just didn't see? \nBrian Cornell: Simeon, I think sitting here today, we've got a very balanced approach to performance in 2024. We are certainly not satisfied with our results in Q1, although they did meet the expectations we set back in March. We won't be satisfied until we see positive comps, and we've got to make sure we're delivering profitable growth along the way. \n So as I look at the first quarter of the year, I think we see a number of green shoots emerging. And we certainly felt much better about the sequential improvement in traffic, getting back to positive digital growth for the first time in over a year, continued strength in services like Drive Up and categories like Beauty, and a very significant trend line improvement in apparel. Christina talked about a 400 basis point improvement. \n We feel very good about the initial reaction from our guests to the relaunch of Target Circle. We think that's going to be an important traffic and growth driver over the balance of the year. And we continue to see very strong performance from Roundel, now our fastest-growing element in our revenue line. \n So we want to balance that with a continued focus on operational efficiencies where we continue to see opportunities for profit improvement; managing inventory very effectively, once again in the quarter, down 7%; and an improvement in in-stocks, which is going to be vital to our performance over the balance of the year. So we think we've got a very balanced approach to making sure we're leading into the top line, while continuing to look at opportunities for greater efficiency and managing the fundamentals of the business. \nSimeon Gutman: And then a follow-up, more tactically, the SG&A related to Target Circle, does that go away? Or you just use the SG&A differently? And then the lower prices, how does that get contemplated? Did you also have flexibility in the guidance when you set it out for the year? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes, I'm happy to take that one, Simeon. I'll maybe start by saying our expectations on the top line and the bottom line for the year are unchanged. And we feel really good about the progress made on the profit line in total in Q1 to expand operating profit rate in spite of a tough sales environment. It's an outcome that we feel puts the year off to a good start. \n And on the SG&A line, as you've heard me say before, you'll see noise on there quarter-over-quarter. One of the things that was an investment in Q1 was investment behind the relaunch of Target Circle, for sure. But I feel really good about the way the team is managing costs throughout the business, and that's all factored into our guidance for the year. \nBrian Cornell: Simeon, one other point on Target Circle, and I know I talked about this, we talked about this more broadly in March. While we're excited about the launch or the relaunch that took place in April, this is going to be an ongoing effort each and every week for multiple years as we look to build the base program and build greater guest engagement, expand the use of the Circle Card and dramatically build membership for Target Circle 360, our approach to same-day delivery. \n So I think it's got to be really clear that while we're excited about the relaunch and the initial reaction, adding 1 million new members, this is going to be an ongoing commitment every week of the year as we continue to use Target Circle as a way to build greater engagement with guests. \nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: How much of the price investment that Target announced this week is going to be funded by Target versus being funded by the vendor community? And is it right to think that now that shrink has turned the corner, Target is taking this favorable factor and reinvesting at least a portion of it in driving traffic-related items? \nA. Hennington: Michael, this is Christina. One of the things that we know for a fact and has been a priority for a very long time is the focus on both Expect More and Pay Less. In fact, that is our brand promise. So value, affordability and how we deliver that is always and has always been important. And as Brian shared in his prepared remarks, it is even more important during this time of 3 years of cumulative inflation in these categories. So our commitment to investing in price on behalf of our guests is to pass savings back along to them to accelerate traffic and unit growth over time. \n Our partners know our playbook. They understand how we go to market, and they are terrific partners in bringing that experience to light, in bringing us great products, innovation and contributing to the value equation for Target. They see us do that in our own brands and they help us do that with their brand portfolio. So this is a long-term commitment on behalf of the guests and is consistent with the strategies we've outlined for quarters. \nMichael Fiddelke: And Michael, maybe to touch on your question on shrink, if you step back and look at our total, we're managing all the levers of the P&L every quarter, every year. On shrink, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in the first quarter. As you heard us say to kick off the year, our hopes for the year were that shrink would flatten this year, and that would be an important first step on a journey to improving shrink over time. \n And so far so good on that front. We're perhaps even a little ahead of where we hoped to be there. And that's step one to get to that plateauing place that we're on a good trajectory for this year. Over time, you can expect we work to make more progress on that line in the years to come. \nBrian Cornell: Michael, we'll get out in front of some of the questions that might be on investors' minds regarding the price investments we announced earlier this week, and this is part of our ongoing focus on retail fundamentals. And you've heard us talk about this for a number quarters now. Michael talked about the great progress we're making on reliability and in-stocks. We want to make sure we continue to provide a great guest experience, leverage our proximity. And you see the way our guests continue to leverage services like Drive Up. \n But affordability is an ongoing part of our playbook. It's embedded in our retail fundamentals. And you see that come to life in how we're merchandising our end caps where we use both our national and owned brands, including the launch of a new brand called dealworthy; the way we're leveraging Target Circle to make it even easier for our guests to get the best of Target every day. \n So this is just an extension of our ongoing focus on affordability, which certainly, in this environment, we know value is critically important. And as we go into the summer season, and Christina talked about some of the great plans we have in place for the summer, we want to make sure America knows that Target is a great place to shop and we've got great value every time you engage, whether it's in-store or through our digital channels. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My quick follow-up is that the outside perception is that Target sales are healthy when it has promotions like Target Circle Week, but outside of those type of events, trends have been a lot softer. So, a, is that the case? And then, b, does that mean that Target has been losing consideration on everyday essentials, and so this price investment is obviously aimed at improving those periods where there are not events or holidays? And how quickly do you expect to see a response from that? \nBrian Cornell: Michael, I'll answer your last portion of that question. We expect to see those trends turn around in the second quarter, and that will be a quarter where we return to growth. And we'll see that fueled by the investments we're making in great assortments, in value and in a great guest experience. So we won't be satisfied until we see positive comps in the second quarter and over the balance of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. \nRupesh Parikh: So my first question is just on the trends during the quarter. If you can just comment on the cadence, the trends you saw, and then any comment during quarter-to-date? And then do you believe weather had any meaningful impact during the quarter? \nMichael Fiddelke: Thanks for the question, Rupesh. I wouldn't call out anything notable in terms of trends as we moved through the quarter. We saw a quarter that from the top line to the bottom line played out largely like we expected it would. And that's a good foundation for us to build on as we move into the second quarter where we expect to return to growth. And you've heard us talk about some of the things that give us confidence in that trajectory. \n But one, I just want to go back to that I touched on my remarks, is the work on retail fundamentals our teams have done, an improved in-stock position, a huge shout-out to teams across merchandising, supply chain and stores that have helped drive that improvement, it's just one more arrow we have in the quiver to show up even stronger in Q2 next year -- or this year than we did last year. \nBrian Cornell: And Rupesh, on the weather front, while we certainly see some volatile weather over the first quarter, that affects everyone in retail. And I feel really good about the way our store teams have responded, how our supply chain responds to some of the disruption we've seen. And I think we're well positioned to continue to maneuver through some of the volatile weather we're seeing across the country. \nRupesh Parikh: Great. And then my follow-up question, just on the merchandising innovation front. So it sounds like your consumers are responding to newness in the box. Just curious how you're feeling about the level of newness innovation for balance of the year. \nA. Hennington: Yes, great question. Definitely, consumers are responding to newness. When they see innovation and they see that as an incredible value, that's what's motivating them to buy. And so our acceleration of percent of newness has just built quarter after quarter. And you saw that really materialize in the apparel improvements in the last quarter. That was based on the backs of ready-to-wear, our perhaps most fashion-forward part of our entire assortment, our performance business, our young contemporary business, those are big owned brands that we control, design and build; All in Motion, Wild Fable, A New Day, et cetera, punctuated by a great partnership with Diane von Furstenberg. \n And so that's a great example. We're doing that in every part of the portfolio. And Q2 is where we get really excited about the opportunity around summer. Summer is a place where we can take advantage of the breadth of the portfolio, like sporting goods, of course, apparel, dresses, shorts, et cetera. But this year, we've added a new twist with our frequency businesses, always standing for sun care, but this year, a big snacking and food destination for summer as well. 125 new items in Favorite Day and Good & Gather to beef up the excitement and relevance during this time. So lots of focus on newness. And also looking for that from our partners, the more innovation, the more that they invest behind newness, the better it is for us. \nOperator: Our next question is from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in your private-label business. With the 2 new launches that you've made recently and the existing very impressive portfolio that you have, it would be great to hear a little bit more color about the momentum that you've seen in that business as you put more investments behind this segment. \nA. Hennington: Thanks, Corey, for your question. We refer to it as owned brands, and it's a slight nuance, but only because we invest behind our private-label solutions, owned brands like any other brand. We put a lot of attention and care into the quality, the durability and the value, of course. I think you're probably referring to dealworthy because we've had a number of different brands and up&up relaunch, but we have a couple more to talk about. So I'm going to assume those were the ones you were questioning. \n We're really excited about early results. It is, however, early. We have a whole cadence of products that we'll roll out throughout the year. And in some cases, we're only 15% to 25% into the cascade of newness, which is why in the prior question, I was talking about how it will build and build and build quarter-by-quarter as more of that comes to market. \n What I'll tell you is where we've made surgical investments in supporting price points that were missing from our assortment, the guest is responding right away. Tech accessories, for instance, we didn't have the right value offering in basic cables, HDMI, phone cases and things like that. When we introduced the right price points in dealworthy, the guest noticed immediately, and that drove unit and traffic acceleration in those categories. And that's what we're doing business by business. \n In up&up specifically, we've reformulated 40% of the products to add quality to the products. Our star ratings and our reviews on Target.com have accelerated meaningfully as the guests have taken notice. So we're excited what that means for the future as that builds throughout the year. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. And then just as a follow-up, one of the things that's also clear with Target is that strong inventory management helps to unlock better margins. So could you talk a little bit more about your current inventory positioning and how you expect that to unfold throughout the rest of the year, especially as it relates to margins? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. Thanks for the question, Corey. And you're spot on, when inventories are in line, we run more efficiently across our entire system. And that's certainly been the case in the last few quarters and is the case now. We feel really good about our inventory position as we step into Q2 here with inventories down 7% at the enterprise level. But most importantly, that efficiency on inventory is coming with a stronger in-stock position. We're always solving for both. And that one-two punch of lower inventories, the higher in-stocks is the outcome that we want and it's the outcome we're getting. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. \nMichael Baker: I just wanted to follow up on a previous question and ask you about these price investments and how much of that was contemplated 90 days ago when you gave your full year outlook? And how does -- or how much of it is a reaction to what you're seeing currently? And as part of that, can you outline within your guidance what you expect for gross margins and SG&A within the context of the comp and EPS guidance? \nBrian Cornell: Mike, I'm happy to start. And those actions were part of our full year guidance and our plans. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit more about the implications of that? \nMichael Fiddelke: Yes. I think the headline is, is we've got 1 quarter in the books that played out largely like we thought, if not a little ahead of our midpoint of guidance on the profit side, and our outlook for the balance of the year is unchanged. So always managing puts and takes across the business, but we knew investment in value was going to be part of the recipe for success this year. And you see this week's announcement as an amplification of some of that plan. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: We wanted to ask a little bit about the other revenue streams. If you can provide any more detail about the margin contribution from Roundel or Target Plus or maybe your distribution of Cat & Jack at Hudson's Bay? And did you see any increase in conversion in Shipt subscriptions as a result of the launch of Target 360? \nBrian Cornell: Kate, a great way for us to wrap up our call today. Michael, do you want to cover some of those topics? \nMichael Fiddelke: Sure. Those are all good ones to touch on. I'll do my best and maybe pair off with Christina on a few of those. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we see in our Roundel ad business. It grew another 20% plus this quarter, and I think that speaks to the value that we're providing guests and some of our partners with that offering. That's been a sustained source of growth, and we would expect that to continue to be a source of growth going forward. \n With Target Plus, you heard us talk about some of the expansion we continue to do there, and that's certainly a contributor to growth within that other revenue line on the quarter as well. So we feel good about how those parts of the business continue to add to both to the top line and to the bottom line. \nA. Hennington: Yes, not a lot to offer besides the fact that you can see the expansion in margin over time, and that comes from creating value with our partners through Roundel. And it isn't just about shifting dollars, it's about accessing new dollars because they see the growth that comes with it and our ability to convert that into sales. \nBrian Cornell: Okay. It gives me an opportunity to recognize a couple of our teams for their work during the quarter. And I'll start with the Roundel team, they just continue to deliver very consistent and meaningful results for us; and all the cross-functional efforts around the relaunch of Target Circle. So I really want to thank those teams and the entire Target team for their contribution during the quarter and their ongoing commitment to getting us back to growth in Q2. \n So I appreciate everyone joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter. \nOperator: Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Cornell",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. \n At our Financial Committee meeting in March, we outlined our long-term vision for profitable growth and a broad range of investments we're making to support those ambitions. We talked about our goal to open more than 300 new stores over the next decade as we continue investing in the vast majority of our existing stores. We discussed the supply chain investments we're making to modernize how we distribute merchandise, including the rollout of additional sortation centers to increase the speed and efficiency of our last-mile delivery.  \n We highlighted investments in technology, including AI and machine learning, to make it easier and more reliable for our team to serve guests in every channel. We previewed the relaunch of our loyalty ecosystem, making it simpler and easier for us to deliver even more value to our guests. We outlined changes to the digital experience and our focus on bringing the joy of discovery to the digital channel, just like we've done in our stores for years. \n We highlighted the value of Roundel, our advertising business, which helps us deepen the connection between Target, our guests and our vendors. Roundel is already making a meaningful contribution to our performance, and it's the fastest-growing part of our business.  \n We talked about the value of Target's unique multi-category assortment, including the launch of new owned brands like Figmint and dealworthy, and our work to widen the footprint of national brand partnerships like Ulta Beauty. And we discussed our commitment to making continued investments in our team, in their pay, benefits, training and more, because we know when we take care of our team, they can focus on taking care of our guests. \n Also in March, we provided our financial guidance for 2024, a year in which we expect Target to get back to growth and build on the enormous gains in guest engagement and top line sales we've seen over the last 5 years. And today, with the first quarter behind us, I'm happy to report we're firmly on track to deliver on that guidance. More specifically, our first quarter comp sales were just above the midpoint of our guidance range, and our Q1 EPS was near the upper end of our expectations. \n And I'll quickly note, while we're not yet satisfied with our current top line performance and we're far short to where we expect to operate over time, we've seen a sustained improvement in multiple business drivers over the last several quarters. This reinforces our confidence that we're moving in the right direction, and we're on track to deliver on our longer-term vision. \n As we continue to monitor the external environment, our view of the U.S. consumer remains the same, as we shared 3 months ago. More specifically, U.S. consumers continue to exhibit a high degree of resilience in the face of multiple challenges, including a rapid rise in prices and interest rates over the last few years. \n In addition, business trends continue to reflect a normalization in spending patterns that first emerged more than 2 years ago, a pattern where consumers are remixing their spending back into services and entertainment outside of their homes after curtailing those activities during the pandemic. This normalization, combined with the cumulative impact of higher prices on consumer budgets, is resulting in continued soft trends in discretionary categories, most notably in Home and Hardlines. \n And today, even as price levels remain high, inflation rates have moderated significantly over the last few quarters. And we've seen a meaningful improvement in discretionary trends, most notably in Apparel, where our performance improved by approximately 4 percentage points in Q1 when compared with last year's fourth quarter. This gives us some optimism that we could see a better balance of spending between discretionary and frequency categories in the years ahead.  \n However, given that we're facing continued uncertainty in the near term, our team remains focused on operational excellence and the agility to respond quickly to changes in the environment. In addition, we're focused on delivering newness to our guests and leaning into seasonal moments, both of which have long served as hallmarks of our brand.  \n Among the highlights in Q1, we were really pleased with the response to our limited-time partnership with the iconic designer, Diane von Furstenberg; and the assortment of pickleball equipment and apparel we offered in partnership with the athletic brand, Prince. Of course, beyond newness and seasons, we continue to focus on delivering unbeatable value to our guests. While our team is always committed to value, it's particularly important in today's environment as consumers look for ways they can stretch their budgets in the face of suddenly high prices.  \n To help our guests in the face of these pressures, this week, we announced that we've made price cuts on 1,500 frequently shopped items in many markets, and we're planning additional price cuts on 1,000 more items this summer. These cuts are focused on everyday items in our Food and Essential categories and are designed to help our guests make the most of their budgets. Collectively, they'll save our guests millions of dollars this summer. \n But low prices are only one of the many ways we deliver value. Another way is through our Target Circle loyalty program, which we relaunched in April. At well over 100 million members, Target Circle is already one of the largest loyalty programs in the United States. And we've redesigned the program to deliver even more value while making it easier to use and understand. \n More specifically, we integrated our credit and debit card programs along with same-day delivery capabilities under a single umbrella, allowing our guests to choose from a range of services and rewards based on their needs and preferences. Christina will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we are really pleased with the consumer response we've seen so far. Most notably, we added more than 1 million new members to Target Circle in the quarter, and we're committed to making sustained investment in this program over the next few years.  \n I want to pause and thank our team for making this relaunch a success. It required a remarkable degree of collaboration and communication across a huge swath of our team, including marketing, stores, digital, financial services, merchandising, technology and finance teams. \n In addition to value, our team is focused on convenience and reliability, including through the digital channel where trends have improved meaningfully over the last few quarters. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in digital sales for the first time in more than a year. This growth was driven by our same-day services, Drive Up, in-store pickup and same-day delivery, which has been rapidly embraced by our guests in recent years.  \n In the first quarter, our same-day services saw high single-digit growth over last year, led by Drive Up, which grew in the low teens. This builds on the explosive growth of Drive Up that occurred during the pandemic, which was followed by double-digit increases in both 2022 and 2023. All together and more than $2 billion in Q1, Drive Up sales were more than 30x larger than we saw in the first quarter of 2019.  \n I want to pause and highlight the outstanding efforts of our operations teams to enhance the guest experience. As Michael will cover in a few minutes, their focus on retail fundamentals is delivering multiple benefits, ranging from better in-stocks to rising guest satisfaction. And of course, our results continue to highlight the benefit of our stores and sub-model, which offers speed, reliability and efficiency regardless of how our guests choose to shop. In the first quarter, our stores fulfilled nearly 98% of our total sales as we relied on our store assets, inventory and team to support every one of them in services we provide. \n So now as I get ready to turn the call over to Christina, I want to pause and take note of how our businesses evolved over time, providing perspective that allows us to look beyond the volatility we've seen in recent years. In the first quarter of 2024, our business generated over $24.5 billion in revenue. That represents growth of just under $7 billion or 39% compared with the first quarter of 2019, the year before the pandemic began. \n We've also seen healthy growth on the bottom line where our business delivered EPS of $2.03 in Q1, which is $0.50 or 33% higher than in 2019. While that pace of bottom line growth is somewhat slower than we've seen on the top line and below what we'd expect to see over time, it reflects some unique profit rate pressures that we faced during the period, a portion of which we expect to offset over the next several years. \n As we look ahead to the remainder of 2024, our team is focused on getting back to top line growth. We expect that will begin in the second quarter as we build on the remarkable gains we've seen over time. Like the U.S. consumer, our team has shown remarkable resilience during an extended period of exceptional volatility. I'm incredibly proud and appreciative of the passion they demonstrate for our guests and for our brand and their strong desire to win in the marketplace. Our team has long been the key to Target's success, and they are the #1 reason I remain confident in our ability to grow profitably in the years ahead.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Christina. Before we turn to your questions, I want to recap what we've covered today, including our view of our business, the environment and both our near-term and long-term prospects. \n Our view of the consumer and the environment remains the same as 90 days ago, and we're pleased that Q1 results were firmly in line with our expectations. While we won't be satisfied until we return to growth, we're encouraged by the meaningful progress we've seen in recent quarters. \n These positive indicators include improving top line trends, resumption of digital growth in the first quarter, led by double-digit growth in Drive Up, continued growth in our Beauty category and a meaningful improvement in our Apparel comp in Q1. These trends reinforce our confidence that we're on the right track and positioned to get back to growth in Q2.  \n Our team is doing an outstanding job in a complicated environment, planning prudently while staying agile and responsive. Our guests are responding to newness throughout our assortment and continuing to turn to us as they celebrate important seasonal moments. They appreciate our focus on value, and they're responding well to recent innovations in our loyalty offering and fulfillment services. They're also responding to continuous improvements in our shopping experience as our team doubles down on retail fundamentals like convenience and reliability. \n At the same time, we're continuing to invest in the long term in new stores and existing stores, the digital shopping experience, our multi-category assortment, supply chain, technology and our rapidly growing Roundel ad business. And we're exploring new opportunities, including the potential to expand the scale and reach of our owned brands through wholesaling arrangements in markets we don't currently serve. And of course, we're continuing to focus on our team, on their pay, benefits, training and development, because they're the #1 differentiator of our brand. \n And our efficiency efforts are providing extra fuel for all of these investments. As the team delivers incremental savings, based on the rapid growth we've seen over the last half decade, they've created additional capacity within our P&L to support robust investments in our business while also delivering stronger profitability over the last several quarters. These elements position us for continued progress over the remainder of the year and for profitable growth over time. \n With that, we'll turn to Q&A. Now Michael, Christina and I will be happy to take your questions. Simeon, I think sitting here today, we've got a very balanced approach to performance in 2024. We are certainly not satisfied with our results in Q1, although they did meet the expectations we set back in March. We won't be satisfied until we see positive comps, and we've got to make sure we're delivering profitable growth along the way. \n So as I look at the first quarter of the year, I think we see a number of green shoots emerging. And we certainly felt much better about the sequential improvement in traffic, getting back to positive digital growth for the first time in over a year, continued strength in services like Drive Up and categories like Beauty, and a very significant trend line improvement in apparel. Christina talked about a 400 basis point improvement. \n We feel very good about the initial reaction from our guests to the relaunch of Target Circle. We think that's going to be an important traffic and growth driver over the balance of the year. And we continue to see very strong performance from Roundel, now our fastest-growing element in our revenue line. \n So we want to balance that with a continued focus on operational efficiencies where we continue to see opportunities for profit improvement; managing inventory very effectively, once again in the quarter, down 7%; and an improvement in in-stocks, which is going to be vital to our performance over the balance of the year. So we think we've got a very balanced approach to making sure we're leading into the top line, while continuing to look at opportunities for greater efficiency and managing the fundamentals of the business. Simeon, one other point on Target Circle, and I know I talked about this, we talked about this more broadly in March. While we're excited about the launch or the relaunch that took place in April, this is going to be an ongoing effort each and every week for multiple years as we look to build the base program and build greater guest engagement, expand the use of the Circle Card and dramatically build membership for Target Circle 360, our approach to same-day delivery. \n So I think it's got to be really clear that while we're excited about the relaunch and the initial reaction, adding 1 million new members, this is going to be an ongoing commitment every week of the year as we continue to use Target Circle as a way to build greater engagement with guests. Michael, we'll get out in front of some of the questions that might be on investors' minds regarding the price investments we announced earlier this week, and this is part of our ongoing focus on retail fundamentals. And you've heard us talk about this for a number quarters now. Michael talked about the great progress we're making on reliability and in-stocks. We want to make sure we continue to provide a great guest experience, leverage our proximity. And you see the way our guests continue to leverage services like Drive Up. \n But affordability is an ongoing part of our playbook. It's embedded in our retail fundamentals. And you see that come to life in how we're merchandising our end caps where we use both our national and owned brands, including the launch of a new brand called dealworthy; the way we're leveraging Target Circle to make it even easier for our guests to get the best of Target every day. \n So this is just an extension of our ongoing focus on affordability, which certainly, in this environment, we know value is critically important. And as we go into the summer season, and Christina talked about some of the great plans we have in place for the summer, we want to make sure America knows that Target is a great place to shop and we've got great value every time you engage, whether it's in-store or through our digital channels. Michael, I'll answer your last portion of that question. We expect to see those trends turn around in the second quarter, and that will be a quarter where we return to growth. And we'll see that fueled by the investments we're making in great assortments, in value and in a great guest experience. So we won't be satisfied until we see positive comps in the second quarter and over the balance of the year. And Rupesh, on the weather front, while we certainly see some volatile weather over the first quarter, that affects everyone in retail. And I feel really good about the way our store teams have responded, how our supply chain responds to some of the disruption we've seen. And I think we're well positioned to continue to maneuver through some of the volatile weather we're seeing across the country. Mike, I'm happy to start. And those actions were part of our full year guidance and our plans. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit more about the implications of that? Kate, a great way for us to wrap up our call today. Michael, do you want to cover some of those topics? Okay. It gives me an opportunity to recognize a couple of our teams for their work during the quarter. And I'll start with the Roundel team, they just continue to deliver very consistent and meaningful results for us; and all the cross-functional efforts around the relaunch of Target Circle. So I really want to thank those teams and the entire Target team for their contribution during the quarter and their ongoing commitment to getting us back to growth in Q2. \n So I appreciate everyone joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "A. Hennington",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned, while we are pleased that our first quarter results came in largely as expected, we won't be satisfied until we start growing again, which is our expectation beginning with the second quarter. \n Before I share the strategy and plans that we expect to fuel this growth in Q2 and beyond, I want to spend a bit of time reinforcing what Brian shared regarding our views of the U.S. consumer and economy as well as providing some additional color on our first quarter results.  \n Our view on the consumer remains largely consistent with our view 3 months ago. Consumers remain surprisingly resilient despite a challenging backdrop of significantly elevated prices compared to just a few years ago. And even as inflation moderates and we see sequential improvement in discretionary category trends, higher interest rates, uncertainty around the future of the economy, continued social and political divisiveness and the upcoming election cycle have consumers concerned about what lies ahead. In fact, consumer confidence took a meaningful dip in April despite a strong job market and normalizing inflation.  \n And beyond the psychological toll of the current environment, the sustained level of elevated prices has had a meaningful impact on budgets and savings for many families. Currently, 1 in 3 Americans has maxed out or is nearing the limit on at least one of their credit cards. For these reasons and more, we remain cautious in our near-term growth outlook. Notably, we expect discretionary trends will continue to remain pressured in the short term, but to normalize over time.  \n Turning to our first quarter results, comparable sales were down 3.7%, driven largely by continued softness in Home and Hardlines categories and softening trends in frequency categories, with lower unit volume and less benefit from price as compared to a year ago. Amidst the pressure, Beauty continues to be a standout category, delivering growth in the low single digits in the quarter. This growth was led by continued strength in Ulta Beauty at Target as well as strong performance in personal care and skincare categories.  \n Apparel, while down low single digits for the quarter, saw a nearly 4 percentage point improvement in comparable sales from Q4. The performance in young contemporary categories delivered comps in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, with guests responding favorably to our new spring fashion sets, new offerings within All in Motion owned brands and our limited-time partnership with Diane von Furstenberg. In fact, our collaboration with DVF was one of the strongest limited-time partnerships we've had in years, driving millions of unique visits to our site daily during launch week and increasing basket size by around 15% on average. This partnership demonstrates our continued ability to bring fashion to all with incredible style and value.  \n Frequency categories saw comparable sales declines in the low single digits. Seasonal moments continue to outperform overall trends in frequency categories, particularly in Food & Beverage. And we saw strong performance in both Valentine's Day and Easter time frames. Sales in Home and Hardlines continue to be soft, though there were notable bright spots in both areas. In Home, the team has found ways to reduce costs in select Home categories, and we passed those savings along to guests. This has led to an acceleration in unit velocity in these categories. \n In Hardlines, the entertainment category grew high single digits, reflecting notable strength from our exclusive offerings of Taylor Swift's latest album release, The Tortured Poets Department. With an exclusive-to-Target version of the album and 3 exclusive CD options, this was the strongest music preorder in our history, elevated by in-store events, including fun photo-ops for the most hardcore Swifties out there as well as the strong presence of our Taylor exclusive on her social channels.  \n In the Sporting Goods category, our exclusive-to-Target partnership with Prince delivered incredible sales momentum in all things pickleball. Beyond the quality and value of this line's equipment and gear, guests are loving the apparel offerings in the line as well. Across our sales channels, sales were the strongest in digital where first quarter comparable sales grew 1.4%. This was driven largely by continued growth in our same-day services as well as meaningful improvement in our Apparel business this quarter.  \n At our Financial Community Meeting in March, Cara and I shared details about changes we've made to our free-to-join loyalty program, Target Circle. And while it is still very early, we're encouraged by the reaction to our April relaunch of Target Circle. In Q1, we added more than 1 million new Target Circle members with strong engagement across all 3 levels of the platform. Our guests tell us they find the program easier to use, appreciate the clarity of the promotions offered and understand the value provided with their membership.  \n Social sentiment is up compared to a year ago, and mentions of Target Circle on social platforms increased by more than 500% versus last year, boosted by our immensely popular marketing campaign featuring Saturday Night Live alum, Kristen Wiig, revisiting her role as the Target Lady. \n In addition to these memorable ads, guests are responding to the automatic application of Target Circle deals when they shop, giving them confidence that they are always getting the best deal on every Target run. Plus, strike-through pricing on Target.com and our app helps guests to clearly see the value they're receiving on those offers. We believe that pricing and value transparency will only become more important with time and that we can continue to grow awareness of the great value we offer across our assortment. \n And while these enhancements drive performance in both our stores and digital channels, our most recent Target Circle Week in April drove outsized benefit to our digital performance. In fact, Q1 Target Circle Week drove the highest traffic to our website and app that we've seen in the past year outside of the Q4 holiday season. In addition, of the Target Circle members who shopped us during Target Circle Week, more than 3/4 redeemed an offer. We're very encouraged by the strong response, and we are just getting started. \n Beyond Target Circle, our team's work to remodel our digital platforms is paying multiple dividends. Newly developed generative AI and personalization capabilities are expanding scope and reach of what we can offer our guests in terms of product recommendations, search results and more. We recently engaged in a pilot with one of our biggest vendors to test our latest personalization capabilities with guests shopping our personal care categories. We're very encouraged by early test results, which showed a nearly 3x lift in conversion rates from personalized promotions versus mass offers, including higher sales lift across the rest of the category as well.  \n In addition to driving more personalization, we're also focused on growing relevance, particularly where there may be opportunities in our current online assortment. As we shared previously, we think our digital marketplace, Target Plus, will play an outsized role in our growth in the quarters and years to come, even as we continue to prioritize the curation of both our assortment and digital partners on the platform. In the past year, we've more than doubled the number of partners and products hosted on Target Plus. We are excited to expand offerings with current partners and introduce new brands to the platform in Q2 and beyond.  \n As we've been saying for years now, the lines between physical and digital shopping continue to blur across retail, and we're taking an industry-leading position to minimize the distinction further. In fact, we view digital as more than just a sales channel. It's also the connective tissue across most of our transactions. Around half of guests that open the Target app on a given day make in-store purchases with us that same day. \n Guests look to our digital platforms for inspiration, helping to plan their next in-store Target run. They use the app while in our stores to check prices, compare products and even navigate our stores more seamlessly. And whether they are choosing to walk through our physical or digital front door, we want to provide the inspiring and welcoming Target experience our guests expect from us.  \n Beyond stores and digital, we're exploring new ways to grow the business outside of these traditional channels. Back in March, we launched a new wholesale collaboration with Canadian retailer, Hudson's Bay, bringing our iconic Cat & Jack's kids apparel brand to Canadian families in its stores and online. The launch is off to a great start with Hudson's Bay customers buying more kids apparel each shopping trip, leading to a 15% increase in their basket size, and Cat & Jack T-shirts and dresses among the top-selling pieces. \n We're already expanding the collection with even more Cat & Jack items that they'll love in categories like swim, outerwear and shoes to keep driving traffic and sales. While it's still early, we're excited about the success of this launch and exploring additional opportunities to bring the love of Target's owned brands to new markets and retail partners.  \n Now let's turn our attention to our expectations for the second quarter. Summer is a time for family and friends, enjoying the beautiful outdoors and embracing adventures near and far. Q2 represents more than half of the year's spend on travel gear, and we have all the must-haves at great prices. From our only-at-Target Open Story owned brand of packing cubes, luggage and more to this summer's hottest books for the airplane and the beach, we have you covered no matter where and how you travel.  \n For the outdoor explorer, we are excited about our latest offerings in our owned brand, Embark, designed to celebrate family time in the great outdoors. Whether roughing it or glamping is your style, our assortment of tents, shelters, sleeping bags, camping chairs and more provide functionality, quality and value for those with a bit of wanderlust. And for those looking to celebrate at home, we have the must-haves for every occasion, from this summer's backyard pool parties to the greatest red, white and blue fashion to celebrate the Fourth of July in style.  \n As Brian mentioned earlier, value remains a top priority for consumers, and we recently reduced prices of more than 1,500 items across our assortment in many markets. In this summer, that list will grow to nearly 5,000 frequently shopped items, all at new lower prices. We also took a hard look at some of the most popular products from last year's summer assortment and reduced retail on a wide range of items, including season-locked deals like $1 pool noodles, $5 pool floats and $15 coolers. Plus, guests can save even more every day when they add personalized promotions available through Target Circle and 5% off every purchase with the Target Circle Card.  \n And of course, our only-at-Target owned-brand offerings deliver unmatched value for our guests, providing the perfect blend of great out-the-door pricing and incredible quality. And just in time for the neighborhood grill-out, we are bringing an abundance of new food offerings through our Good & Gather and Favorite Day owned brands. With more than 125 new items hitting shelves, plus exclusive flavors of hot national brands like bubly sparkling water and poppi, we expect to be included in a whole lot of barbecues this summer.  \n But summer always goes by quickly. And before we know it, guests will shift their focus from fun in the sun to preparing for a return to school and college. Our brand stands tall for families, so it is no surprise that around 70% of our guests shop in our Back-to-School and Back-to-College categories. And this year, we are going bigger than ever in that critical season. Our goal is to help guests celebrate the joy of going back to school wherever and whenever they want to shop, delivering an easy and convenient omnichannel shopping experience surrounded by relevant and new products at unbeatable value.  \n Before I turn things over to Michael, I want to pause and thank our teams for yet another quarter of tirelessly supporting our guests, our shareholders and each other. Although they make it look easy, managing in the current environment is anything but straightforward, and it is their passion and talent that allows us to drive great interactions with our guests to keep inventory lean and yet improve our in-stock positions and set us up quarter after quarter to help all families discover the joy of everyday life.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Michael, this is Christina. One of the things that we know for a fact and has been a priority for a very long time is the focus on both Expect More and Pay Less. In fact, that is our brand promise. So value, affordability and how we deliver that is always and has always been important. And as Brian shared in his prepared remarks, it is even more important during this time of 3 years of cumulative inflation in these categories. So our commitment to investing in price on behalf of our guests is to pass savings back along to them to accelerate traffic and unit growth over time. \n Our partners know our playbook. They understand how we go to market, and they are terrific partners in bringing that experience to light, in bringing us great products, innovation and contributing to the value equation for Target. They see us do that in our own brands and they help us do that with their brand portfolio. So this is a long-term commitment on behalf of the guests and is consistent with the strategies we've outlined for quarters. Yes, great question. Definitely, consumers are responding to newness. When they see innovation and they see that as an incredible value, that's what's motivating them to buy. And so our acceleration of percent of newness has just built quarter after quarter. And you saw that really materialize in the apparel improvements in the last quarter. That was based on the backs of ready-to-wear, our perhaps most fashion-forward part of our entire assortment, our performance business, our young contemporary business, those are big owned brands that we control, design and build; All in Motion, Wild Fable, A New Day, et cetera, punctuated by a great partnership with Diane von Furstenberg. \n And so that's a great example. We're doing that in every part of the portfolio. And Q2 is where we get really excited about the opportunity around summer. Summer is a place where we can take advantage of the breadth of the portfolio, like sporting goods, of course, apparel, dresses, shorts, et cetera. But this year, we've added a new twist with our frequency businesses, always standing for sun care, but this year, a big snacking and food destination for summer as well. 125 new items in Favorite Day and Good & Gather to beef up the excitement and relevance during this time. So lots of focus on newness. And also looking for that from our partners, the more innovation, the more that they invest behind newness, the better it is for us. Thanks, Corey, for your question. We refer to it as owned brands, and it's a slight nuance, but only because we invest behind our private-label solutions, owned brands like any other brand. We put a lot of attention and care into the quality, the durability and the value, of course. I think you're probably referring to dealworthy because we've had a number of different brands and up&up relaunch, but we have a couple more to talk about. So I'm going to assume those were the ones you were questioning. \n We're really excited about early results. It is, however, early. We have a whole cadence of products that we'll roll out throughout the year. And in some cases, we're only 15% to 25% into the cascade of newness, which is why in the prior question, I was talking about how it will build and build and build quarter-by-quarter as more of that comes to market. \n What I'll tell you is where we've made surgical investments in supporting price points that were missing from our assortment, the guest is responding right away. Tech accessories, for instance, we didn't have the right value offering in basic cables, HDMI, phone cases and things like that. When we introduced the right price points in dealworthy, the guest noticed immediately, and that drove unit and traffic acceleration in those categories. And that's what we're doing business by business. \n In up&up specifically, we've reformulated 40% of the products to add quality to the products. Our star ratings and our reviews on Target.com have accelerated meaningfully as the guests have taken notice. So we're excited what that means for the future as that builds throughout the year. Yes, not a lot to offer besides the fact that you can see the expansion in margin over time, and that comes from creating value with our partners through Roundel. And it isn't just about shifting dollars, it's about accessing new dollars because they see the growth that comes with it and our ability to convert that into sales."

            "name": "Michael Fiddelke",
            "content": "Thanks, Christina. As Brian highlighted earlier, we take a long-term approach when making investments in our business with a focus on delighting consumers and our guests both today and in the years ahead. This approach has led to outstanding financial performance over the long term, and we're confident it will continue to serve us well in the months and years ahead. And today, as I step into my new role as COO, I'm bringing this long-term perspective with me as I work with my new team to invest in a reliable and differentiated guest experience.  \n In support of that experience, over the last 5 quarters, our team has done an outstanding job of maintaining appropriate inventory levels aligned with sales trends in each of our categories. This discipline has led to a notably leaner inventory position overall and, most importantly, much better in-stocks as well. Those improvements continued in the first quarter across multiple measures of reliability. \n A key indicator of this progress is our overall in-stock position, which improved by more than 3 percentage points versus the prior quarter and even more when compared with the year ago. While this broad measure is critically important, the team also drills down into far more granular metrics, allowing them to focus on the biggest opportunities for improvement. \n For example, our top item in-stock measure focuses on the 1/3 of our assortment that turns most quickly, and we've seen impressive progress on this measure in recent quarters. More specifically, in Q1, the out-of-stock rate on this group of top items was less than half of what we're seeing overall, having improved by more than 4 percentage points when compared with a year ago.  \n We also had in-stock measures for our highest-volume stores and our small-format stores, both of which faced unique operating challenges. We also carefully measure in-stocks on our new store portfolio to ensure we make a strong first impression when we open in new neighborhoods. And we focus on our seasonal programs given the limited time window in which those assortments are offered. I'm happy to report that our team delivered improvements in each of these in-stock measures in Q1, enabling the overall improvement I highlighted earlier.  \n A critical factor supporting our reliability is the upstream supply chain where we've been seeing improvements as well. These include the new upstream distribution facilities we've opened over the last couple of years, which have been seeing improvements in their own reliability measures even as they continue to ramp their throughput. \n We've also seen improvements through continued collaboration with our vendor partners where we're approaching pre-pandemic levels of reliability regarding inbound shipments arriving on time and in full. Given the importance of reliability to our guests, these measures should always remain a primary focus for our team. While we're proud of our recent progress, we know we have more room to improve, and we're committed to extending these gains in the quarters and years ahead.  \n Beyond product availability, our store teams continue to focus on retail fundamentals and operational excellence, ensuring we maintain best practices, particularly when it comes to the guest experience. One change we recently implemented was the decision to limit the number of items at self-checkout in our stores nationwide. This decision was made after rigorous testing last year and is intended to ensure our team can provide the best possible experience at both our full-service checkout lanes and also at self-checkout. As a result, when we made the recent change in our self-checkout lanes, we also engaged with our store teams across the country to ensure they are consistently providing adequate staffing at our full-service lanes.  \n With these recent changes and consistent with results from last year's test, we've seen a rapid rise in guest satisfaction scores relating to both wait times and the quality of interactions with our team at checkout. For both of these metrics, average scores in the first quarter were higher than a year ago, and we saw increases in these metrics between the beginning and the end of the quarter as well. \n We're also pleased with the guest response to our most recently launched Drive Up services, namely the ability for guests to get their favorite Starbucks items with their Drive Up order and the option to make a return from the Drive Up lane. While we received high satisfaction scores across all of our same-day services, returns received the highest rating of any service we provide. And notably, the Net Promoter Score for Drive Up returns moved even higher in the first quarter, exceeding the sky-high score this service was receiving a year ago. \n And finally, I want to highlight the entire team's effort to support the relaunch of Target Circle in early April with a special shout-out to our store team. From the installation of compelling new signing throughout every sales floor across the country and the focus on providing an engaging experience for guests who wanted to better understand our new program, our team did an outstanding job preparing for and supporting the launch of this new program. And while it's only one of many ways to measure its success, I'm really proud of our team's role in signing up more than 1 million new Target Circle members in the first quarter. \n Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. On the top line in Q1, total sales declined 3.2%, reflecting a 3.7% decline in comparable sales, partially offset by the impact of our new stores. Among the drivers of our comparable sales, traffic was down 1.9% in the first quarter. The average transaction was also down 1.9% as consumers continue to spend cautiously, particularly in discretionary categories. \n Total revenue was down 3.1% in the quarter, reflecting a 3.9% increase in other revenue. Among the components of other revenue, a decline in credit card profit sharing was offset primarily by the benefit of more than 20% growth in our Roundel ad business, along with increases in several smaller items, including revenue from Target Plus. \n Our first quarter gross margin rate was about 140 basis points higher than last year. About 1 percentage point of this improvement was in merchandising where we continue to benefit from favorable freight rates and other cost savings, which offset higher promotional markdown rate. Also in Q1, we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement from category mix and 20 basis points of benefit from inventory shrink. \n As I mentioned at our Financial Community Meeting in March, we've been encouraged to see a growing focus on retail theft at the federal, state and local levels, and we continue to take our own steps to reduce theft in our stores. Based on our recent physical inventory counts, we continue to believe that shrink rates are positioned to reach a plateau this year. And in Q1, the results of those inventory counts were favorable versus our expectations. \n As a result, we now expect to see a full year gross margin rate benefit related to shrink, most notably in the second quarter. While this improvement will serve as only a small first step in offsetting the significant headwind we faced in recent years, we're encouraged to see this metric moving in the right direction. \n On the SG&A line, we saw a rate increase of about 130 basis points in the first quarter, reflecting the deleveraging effect of a decline in sales, combined with the impact of multiple cost increases, including compensation and benefits for our team and higher marketing expense to support the launch of Target Circle. \n On the D&A line, we saw a rate increase of about 20 basis points over last year, reflecting the deleveraging impact of lower sales, along with an increase in dollars driven by a number of recently completed capital projects. Altogether, we're pleased that our operating margin rate was up slightly from a year ago despite a decline in sales. \n Our enterprise efficiency efforts played a key role in this outcome, resulting in savings throughout our P&L. These savings helped to offset continued investments in our team and pressure from year-over-year investments in promotions and marketing. While these efficiency efforts were broad-based, they included work within merchandising to implement changes in owned-brand sourcing and design, resulting in lower product costs and other savings. \n They also included work that delivered productivity gains across our general merchandise and food distribution networks, improvements in middle-mile fill rates and changes within our last-mile delivery capability to optimize units per package and save on delivery costs. And while there's much more opportunity in front of us, the team is already making progress in reducing complexity on the apparel floor pad and the back rooms of our stores, reducing the cost of digital fulfillment while making our team more efficient overall. \n As I mentioned earlier, we continue to feel really good about our inventory position, which was 7% lower than a year ago, even as we continue to benefit from the in-stock improvements I already covered. When we look back to the first quarter of 2019, total inventory has increased about 30% over those 5 years, while sales in the quarter just ended were about 39% higher than in 2019. Given that this growth in sales was largely driven by an increase in our sales per store, an increase in our inventory turns is something we'd expect to see and something that should be sustainable over time. \n Now I want to turn to capital deployment and briefly reiterate our priorities, which have been consistent for several decades. First, we look to fully invest in our business and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Second, we look to support our dividend and build on our decades-long record of annual dividend growth. And finally, we deploy excess cash to repurchase shares within the limits of our middle A credit ratings. \n Regarding the first priority, first quarter CapEx was just under $700 million, and we remain on track to invest a total of $3 billion to $4 billion for the full year. Regarding the second priority, we paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, up about 2% from a year ago. Later this quarter, we plan to recommend that our Board approve a small increase in the quarterly dividend in support of our goal to build on our decades-long record of annual dividend increases and move toward a 40% payout ratio over time. \n Regarding the third priority, we didn't repurchase any shares in the first quarter, consistent with the expectation I shared at our Financial Community Meeting. As I mentioned at that time, we focused on strengthening our balance sheet throughout 2023 and saw a rapid recovery in our debt metrics. And as I also mentioned that day, given our expectation for Target's financial performance for the remainder of 2024, we may have the ability to resume share repurchase activity later this year while maintaining our debt ratings at the middle A level. \n Now I'll close my commentary on the quarter by covering our after-tax return on invested capital. For the trailing 12 months through the end of Q1, our business delivered an after-tax ROIC of 15.4%, up from 11.4% a year ago. An after-tax return of 15% is strong performance relative to our industry, and we expect to see continued growth in this metric into the high teens over time. \n Now I want to turn to our expectations for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we are planning for a comparable sales increase in the 0% to 2% range. While this is below the growth rate we'd expect to deliver over time, it reflects the continued cautious approach to our near-term outlook, which has served us well in recent quarters. \n On the bottom line in Q2, we're guiding to a range of $1.95 to $2.35. The midpoint of this EPS range represents a growth rate of approximately 20% over last year as we continue to build on the profit rate expansion we've seen over the last few quarters. For the full year, we're maintaining our prior guidance for a comparable sales increase in the 0% to 2% range and EPS of $8.60 to $9.60. We believe these ranges continue to properly capture the range of scenarios we're contemplating given how the environment and our business has progressed so far this year. \n Before I turn the call back over to Brian, I want to thank the team for their continued energy and dedication in what continues to be a very complicated environment. While I'm still digging into my new role leading operations, I've been inspired and impressed by our team's passion, ingenuity and strong desire to win together. Even as they continue to navigate the near term with agility, the team is also keeping an eye firmly on the future and thinking about how Target will be operating in 1, 3, 5 or even 10 years from now. It's energizing work, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve alongside this amazing team. \n Now I'll turn the call back over to Brian. Yes, I'm happy to take that one, Simeon. I'll maybe start by saying our expectations on the top line and the bottom line for the year are unchanged. And we feel really good about the progress made on the profit line in total in Q1 to expand operating profit rate in spite of a tough sales environment. It's an outcome that we feel puts the year off to a good start. \n And on the SG&A line, as you've heard me say before, you'll see noise on there quarter-over-quarter. One of the things that was an investment in Q1 was investment behind the relaunch of Target Circle, for sure. But I feel really good about the way the team is managing costs throughout the business, and that's all factored into our guidance for the year. And Michael, maybe to touch on your question on shrink, if you step back and look at our total, we're managing all the levers of the P&L every quarter, every year. On shrink, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in the first quarter. As you heard us say to kick off the year, our hopes for the year were that shrink would flatten this year, and that would be an important first step on a journey to improving shrink over time. \n And so far so good on that front. We're perhaps even a little ahead of where we hoped to be there. And that's step one to get to that plateauing place that we're on a good trajectory for this year. Over time, you can expect we work to make more progress on that line in the years to come. Thanks for the question, Rupesh. I wouldn't call out anything notable in terms of trends as we moved through the quarter. We saw a quarter that from the top line to the bottom line played out largely like we expected it would. And that's a good foundation for us to build on as we move into the second quarter where we expect to return to growth. And you've heard us talk about some of the things that give us confidence in that trajectory. \n But one, I just want to go back to that I touched on my remarks, is the work on retail fundamentals our teams have done, an improved in-stock position, a huge shout-out to teams across merchandising, supply chain and stores that have helped drive that improvement, it's just one more arrow we have in the quiver to show up even stronger in Q2 next year -- or this year than we did last year. Yes. Thanks for the question, Corey. And you're spot on, when inventories are in line, we run more efficiently across our entire system. And that's certainly been the case in the last few quarters and is the case now. We feel really good about our inventory position as we step into Q2 here with inventories down 7% at the enterprise level. But most importantly, that efficiency on inventory is coming with a stronger in-stock position. We're always solving for both. And that one-two punch of lower inventories, the higher in-stocks is the outcome that we want and it's the outcome we're getting. Yes. I think the headline is, is we've got 1 quarter in the books that played out largely like we thought, if not a little ahead of our midpoint of guidance on the profit side, and our outlook for the balance of the year is unchanged. So always managing puts and takes across the business, but we knew investment in value was going to be part of the recipe for success this year. And you see this week's announcement as an amplification of some of that plan. Sure. Those are all good ones to touch on. I'll do my best and maybe pair off with Christina on a few of those. We continue to be thrilled with the strength we see in our Roundel ad business. It grew another 20% plus this quarter, and I think that speaks to the value that we're providing guests and some of our partners with that offering. That's been a sustained source of growth, and we would expect that to continue to be a source of growth going forward. \n With Target Plus, you heard us talk about some of the expansion we continue to do there, and that's certainly a contributor to growth within that other revenue line on the quarter as well. So we feel good about how those parts of the business continue to add to both to the top line and to the bottom line."
