        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nChuck Triano: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 financial results, our 2021 financial guidance, as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President, Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a year like none other in Pfizer\u2019s history. With the separation of Upjohn complete, we saw the culmination of Pfizer\u2019s decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused Company. Through our collaboration with BioNTech, we delivered the world\u2019s first breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine in less than a year. And by harnessing the power of the variety of digital capabilities, we made sure that despite the lockdowns and travel restrictions, we continue to serve patients around the world who rely on our medicines and vaccines. Despite this challenging environment and the incredible amount of resources we devoted to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 8% operational revenue growth for the year from our core biopharmaceutical product portfolio, excluding the revenue impact from consumer healthcare and excluding $154 million in sales of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that we recorded in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this 8% operational growth includes a negative 2% impact due to the slowdown in macroeconomic and healthcare activity resulting from the pandemic. This operational growth was driven primarily by continued strong performances from Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Oncology Biosimilars, Ibrance, Prevenar 13 outside of the U.S., Inlyta, Xeljanz, and Xtandi, so basically all the growth drivers contributed significantly.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. We again saw a very solid revenue growth for the business in the quarter and the year, which continues to support our projected 6%-plus revenue CAGR through the end of 2025. As a reminder, this growth projection excludes any contribution from the COVID vaccine. In terms of the price and volume mix for the year, the grow up of the 8% operational growth we posted, excluding consumer healthcare and the COVID vaccine, our underlying Biopharmaceuticals portfolio generated 10% volume growth, offset by a negative 2% price impact. So, continued very strong volume overall. Foreign exchange had a slightly positive impact on revenue in the quarter with a 1% benefit for the full year, while for the full year, we saw an overall negative impact of 1%. So, 1% positive for the quarter, 1% negative for the full year. Now, moving down the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were lower in the quarter, mainly due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, product mix and unfavorable year-over-year impact of cash flow hedging on inventory and COVID-related expenses. However, it's important to note that on an annual basis, adjusted gross margin for 2020 was within 90 basis points of 2019 and around 80%. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the quarter were lower by 2% on an operational basis and lower by 10% on an annual basis. There remain two main factors that drive the decrease for the year, the exclusion of consumer health and lower selling expenses due to COVID, and to a lesser extent, the early implementation of a planned reduction in spending associated with our corporate-enabling functions. Adjusted R&D expenses grew 24% in the quarter and 15% for the year on an operational basis. This growth was primarily driven by our investment in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was up significantly compared to the prior year quarter, mainly driven by lower asset impairment charges compared to the year ago quarter. For the year, reported earnings were lower, mainly due to the non-recurrence of the gain on the consumer joint venture formation in 2019. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% for the quarter and 20% for the year on an operational basis. I'd add that our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $2.22, which is below the range of $2.28 to $2.38 we had given in terms of new Pfizer financials on a full year basis. I just want to remind you that we had indicated on last quarter's earnings call that our actual reported numbers would be lower than the guidance because the guidance assumed full year of operating without Upjohn as well as assuming a full year benefit of transitional service agreement recoveries and lower interest expenses from the deployment of the $12 billion in proceeds to pay down debt. So with the deal not closing until November, we only had a small benefit from these factors in our reported 2020 financials. Now, let's move to our 2021 guidance. We provided total Company guidance, which includes the COVID vaccine, and then we provided some additional sub-ledger detail on our assumptions regarding the projected COVID vaccine contribution, so you can also get a read on the business out. In terms of revenue, we are projecting a range of $59.4 billion to $61.4 billion, which includes a foreign exchange benefit of approximately $1.4 billion. And at the guidance range midpoint represents operational growth of 41% from 2020. For adjusted cost of goods, the range is 32% to 33% as a percentage of revenue, which incorporates the COVID vaccine, gross profit share payment to BioNTech, as well as some other related items I will speak to in a moment. On a side end, what we see is the impact of increased sales and marketing expense behind key growth brands as well as for expected product launches, led by our enabling function, cost savings. In addition, we see growth in R&D, which follows along with our pipeline development cadence. And I note, given our clinical trial success metrics Albert referenced, we're confident about making sound R&D investments. Adjusted other income and deductions is projected at just over $2 billion of income. In addition to the usual items included here, remind you for modeling purpose that three larger items in terms of income are our GSK consumer healthcare joint venture equity income, ViiV dividend income and transition service agreement recoveries, primarily related to Viatris. Working this through with our projected 15% tax rate yield and adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.10 to $3.20 with 38% operational growth at the midpoint. This range is a bit higher than what we discussed three weeks ago and was driven mainly by an increase in our COVID vaccine sales projections since then. Let me offer some assumptions and context on the projected COVID vaccine financial contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine collaboration construct is a 50-50 gross profit split. Pfizer will book the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, and we do not participate in China. We continue to expect that we can manufacture up to 2 billion doses in 2021. However, given it\u2019s still early in the year, we are not projecting that we will sell all those doses. Ultimately, we made contract of all the doses, but for the purposes for our initial guidance, we primarily included doses that are covered by strong supply agreements with various governments. On this, we currently forecast approximately $15 billion in COVID vaccine revenue, as which is what you see here. Given we remain in negotiations for additional contracts, we are not providing the number of doses behind the revenue estimate. Our cost of sales for the COVID vaccine revenue will include manufacturing and distribution costs, a royalty payment allowance as well as a payment to BioNTech, representing the 50% gross profit split. All-in, this yields an anticipated income before tax COVID vaccine in the high 20% range. Let me add that if we contract for additional -- if we contract with the delivery of additional doses during the year, we will provide a guidance update in our subsequent earnings releases. If we remove the projected COVID vaccine contribution and related impacts on revenue, that results in our business having 2021 projected annual revenue between $44.4 billion and $46.6 billion. So, 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint, and about 8% if we include the current favorable impact of foreign exchange compared to last year. In terms of adjusted cost of goods, net of the COVID vaccine, we see a range between 21% and 22% as a percentage of revenues. For adjusted diluted EPS, we see a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents 11% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent with how we've been publicly positioning the business subsequent to the Upjohn separation. In terms of reporting our quarterly earnings, we are not going to report two sets of financials, one with COVID and one without. But, I think the context in terms of the vaccine margins will be helpful in calculating a good estimate of the adjusted diluted EPS impact, based on the COVID vaccine revenue, we will report in future earnings releases. Let me speak for a moment about our dividend going forward and how it will initially be linked to the Viatris dividend once it is declared. To make it simple, let's start with Pfizer's current annualized dividend rate of $1.56 per share. A Pfizer shareholder owning 100 shares just prior to the spin-off, would now still own their 100 shares of Pfizer and also 12 shares of Viatris, assuming they have continued to hold the Viatris shares. The 100 shares of Pfizer would generate $156 in annual dividend income. And currently, the 12 shares of Viatris do not generate any dividend income. This $156 in annual dividend income is what we will preserve. Once Viatris declares its dividend, we will calculate the annual income generated by the 12 shares of Viatris, and then adjust the Pfizer dividend, so the combined annual income generated from the 100 shares of Pfizer and 12 shares of Viatris, totals at least that $156 in 2021. For the foreseeable future, we expect our Board to continue to support annual dividend increases at approximately this year's level. Obviously, we have no say as to what Viatris does with its future dividend. I hope this example is helpful. In summary, we had a strong 2020. The separation of Upjohn is behind us. The business is on track for solid top and bottom line growth. And we are highly focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting and market brands, and looking to deploy capital responsibly with a focus on initiatives that can solidify our long-term revenue and earnings growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.\nChuck Triano: Great. Thank you, Frank and Albert for the prepared remarks. Operator, at this point, can we please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger: Thanks very much. So first of all, congrats on the phenomenal vaccine progress and the benefits that Pfizer is driving for society. That's much appreciated by everyone on this call and beyond. My two questions relate to vaccine prospects and Xeljanz. So, first, could you speak to how you are projecting vaccine sales for ?\nDr. Albert Bourla: David, unfortunately, you are cutting off and I couldn't hear you. Can you repeat the question of the vaccine from the beginning?\nDavid Risinger: \nDr. Albert Bourla: Unfortunately, the line is not good, David. We can't hear you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I have two questions. In what scenarios would you not sell all 2 billion doses of COVID vaccine Pfizer can manufacture in 2021? Some competitors haven't exactly exceeded expectations, and only a small fraction of global demand has been satisfied to date. So, it seems as though you'll sell every dose you make and that the current guidance is going to be way low. Second question is on the Xeljanz CV study, should we assume DVT tracked similarly to MACE? And given that Pfizer has other JAKs in development, what do you believe are the long-term implications for the JAK class overall given this recent Xeljanz CV study?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Steve. Let me take the COVID one, and then I will ask Mikael to comment on the Xeljanz first part, and then Angela on the implications from commercial. Steve, we try not to give a low expectation, we try to give a responsible expectation. If we are asking if there is a scenario that we will sell everything, yes, there is. Also, I would tell you that if that was an open market, which means that the physicians and citizens, they have the ability to choose which vaccine they would receive, I would feel very comfortable that we will have the lion market share because we are first and we are best, as you have clearly indicated. And we have great operations in basically every country in the world. But, this is not an open market, at least for this year. This year, it is a market that it is controlled by governments appropriately because I think we are in a crisis, as you know. And also, it is a market that creates a lot of political pressure. So, not always the decisions are sound, solid, and avoiding panic. So, with that in mind, we have a formula that we try to implement in a responsible way that takes into consideration the contracts that we have, the potential for future contracts, but also takes into consideration the strength of the contracts, takes into consideration the potential for other vaccines to present data. And in fact, the reason why we changed our revenue projections, which resulted in $0.10 improvement in our bottom line, is because we did have more news from the AstraZeneca registration and the way that it is perceived in Europe. We had the news from the J&J that reported data. We have much better visibility now in the last two weeks on their manufacturing capabilities, all of that resulted in us increasing our projections. Clearly, there are a lot -- this is a multidimensional, let's say, challenge to have accurate projections. And clearly, we are having dynamic changes, which we will follow, and we will update our estimates as time comes. But, in all honesty, I couldn't responsibly just say right now, we are going to sell everything we can make, the 2 billion, when we have all this dynamic situation that it is evolving. Now, why don't we move to Mikael to talk a little bit about the MACE, on Xeljanz, and then Angela on the revenue expectations.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you, Albert, and Steve, for the questions. As you know, the 1133 study for Xeljanz was rather unique population with increased severe risk. Now, Xeljanz has been studied in numerous clinical trials and in the market where a large population has used it in a more general RA population or in ulcerative colitis. And in those populations, it has had a very robust efficacy to safety profile. I think, RA by itself has more CV liabilities, standard RA patients, and this was a very specific subset. Now, going to other JAK inhibitors, the next generation of JAK inhibitors such as abrocitinib in registration for atopic dermatitis, or as Albert reported, ritlecitinib, which is a unique JAK3/TEC inhibitor, each JAK inhibitor differs by itself. And we think both of these two that I mentioned have very encouraging benefit to risk profile. And while regulatory agencies have, in some instances, inferred general class-label across JAKs, I think the experience will tell that abrocitinib for atopic dermatitis has a very compelling efficacy and risk profile and ritlecitinib for alopecia that's reading out later this year or for vitiligo and ulcerative colitis where we have very encouraging Phase 2 data, again, has a unique profile. So, I don't think that we should extend 1133 to other JAKs, and I think we\u2019ll also need to look at Xeljanz having a very robust profile in population that was not a smaller version of the 1133 study. Thank you very much.\nAngela Hwang: Thanks, Mikael. And then, just building off of what Mikael has said. As you know, we have a very robust data set that has been built around Xeljanz for over seven years, 50 different clinical trials, 260,000 patients that are currently on Xeljanz, and of course, a very robust real-world data set that goes along with these 260,000 patients. So, I think based on all of this and together with the fact that we are still so early on in our understanding of the 1133 data as it pertains to Xeljanz that we feel confident that Xeljanz will remain an important part of the treatment paradigm for RA patients and for patients with PsA and UC as well, and that it has an appropriate and favorable benefit risk profile for this sort of patient population type. And so, of course, we will share the data with you as we continue to learn more about the study. But for now, that's how we see it. And then, I think you had one more question in terms of how do we think about this in terms of impact on our other JAKs. And as Mikael said, scientifically, each one of these molecules are very different. And they're all being designed with a different benefit risk profile to match the different disease condition as well as the different patient types. And so, I think as a result, we continue to be very confident about our JAK portfolio and the investments that we're making in each one of these. And we think that what we will be able to deliver are differentiated profiles that will be appropriate and fit-for-purpose for that condition and for that patient type.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Truist Securities.\nGregg Gilbert: Thank you. Albert, it seems pretty clear that Pfizer, the stock anyway is not getting a whole lot of credit for the COVID-19 vaccine. And whether or not you agree that that's fair, I'm curious how you expect to leverage the expertise you've built in this area into areas that investors might view as contributing more to long-term franchise value, regardless of what happens to the COVID-19 part of the story. And then, a second vaccine-related question perhaps for Angela. There's been a lot of focus on your vaccine and others about logistics and supply and coverage of variance. But, it seems to me that at some point, a key metric, if not the most important metric will be how many people want to get a vaccine. So, curious what your work tells you on that front, and whether you plan to get involved as a company in helping drive awareness and demand at some point, or is that not really Pfizer's role to play?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Gregg, thank you very much. I fully agree with you, but I don't think we're receiving a lot of credit, not for the vaccines right now when you see the stock price, but mainly for our basic business and pipeline. This is business that is growing 6% and double-digit, the bottom line, excluding any COVID. And it clearly deserves much, much higher multiple in this industry. The same comes even more when you speak about the COVID-19 vaccine. But, I think, clearly, people should see much more into that. So, to your question, how do we plan to use strategically this platform? I believe that the RNA technology has been proven in a glorious way that will have an impact in treating diseases, in preventing diseases in multiple applications. And I believe Pfizer has accumulated expertise and knowledge of a decade into one year. And also Pfizer has completed infrastructure investments that would take five years, again, into one year. So clearly, we plan to use this expertise so that we will be able to benefit more and more patients. I made some comments that within the COVID vaccine, I believe that COVID is -- the dynamics in the COVID more and more indicate the potential, but we will have a clearly repeated business. The reasons for that are multiple. Let me start by saying, in the beginning, we were waiting to see if the immunity will be durable. Now, we still don't have data about the immunity of our vaccine because it is early, but we do see that the people that have the disease, more and more publications indicate that after several months, the immune response goes down. So, there is a need to boost. Also, there are a lot of papers that have been published that indicate even for the new variants that if you have very high level of immune responses, you are protecting against those values in much higher level than if you have lower levels of these antibodies. So, that indicates that the need to boost or that maintain much higher levels, it's there. And last but not least, it is clear that the scenario that the variants will develop in such a way that they may be escaping very effective protection from the current vaccine, which is not the case right now for us. Then, we\u2019re clearly preparing ourselves so that we will produce in a very speedy time and made publicly a statement that that needs to be done end-to-end in less than 100 days to provide new booster vaccines that will protect against the new variant. So, in scenarios like that and even in scenarios that the COVID will move from a pandemic into more of a normal type of vaccination business, it is very clear that Pfizer will have a key advantage, not only because of the strength of the data, but also because we have developed significant brand equity and trust with the people when it comes to their choice. We have infrastructure and expertise that will help us. RNA is not going to provide only COVID-19 vaccines. We are accelerating our work for flu right now. And we are clearly investigating multiple other applications in other vaccines for this RNA technology or therapeutic areas. So, I believe that our business, excluding COVID, is very robust with robust pipeline. But I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting from now. And with that, I will ask Angela to comment on the question about, again, the COVID vaccine. Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Thanks for the question. And I think, what you're talking about is vaccine confidence, which clearly has been a big topic since the vaccine was introduced. And I'm actually really encouraged by data that we're receiving on a routine basis that is demonstrating that vaccine confidence is indeed building, and that compared to where we were even a month ago, we've had a significant rise in interest and willingness of the public to get vaccinated. And I think, a lot of this is driven, obviously, by real-world experience by many people who are now getting the vaccine and having good experiences with them. So, I think that this will continue. To your question about what is it that we're doing to drive awareness and demand? I think, first of all, we have to understand that right now, we are in a period where we are operating under an EUA, the emergency approval. So, there is guardrail as it pertains to that and what it is that we can do. For sure, we have worked very diligently with many, many, many medical and public health societies and institutions to ensure that we are supporting education across the entire country. There recently was even a public service announcement that was launched where it had our support in conjunction with a number of patient advocacy groups to really educate and to create confidence for the public around this vaccine. In addition to that, at a more specific level, Pfizer uniquely has really supported the healthcare professional community in its vaccination by providing a lot of training, a lot of support to ensure that confidence is gained at the vaccination side. And actually, just to share that over 30,000 HCPs have been trained by Pfizer alone in the recent month or so to be able to confidently vaccinate these -- vaccinate people. And I think that that's also helping to create confidence. But, of course, where we can get most involved and we'll be able to do even more, is once we receive BLA. And so, we're working towards that. And we will build on the education initiatives that we already have in place, but we'll be able to amplify that even more, once we have a full label. Thank you.\nChuck Triano: Thanks, Angela. And good point on the BLA opening up more opportunities. Next question, please, operator?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. And thank you for all the work you\u2019re doing, again, on the COVID vaccine. I was just wondering is there an integrated system that's being set up by either the government -- or governments or Pfizer to monitor instances of vaccine, breakthroughs and conduct sequencing. And then, what factors and who will ultimately dictate when a change in the potential of vaccine is needed to cover an emerging variant? How does the consensus emerge on that question? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. Mikael, would you like to take this question, please?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. There are different organized, at the government levels, efforts. In the U.S., the position of sequences both to track new strains, like the South Africa and Brazil, as well among unvaccinated and vaccinated or deposited in certain databases. There is one initiative in UK. And then, of course, Pfizer has the unique collaboration in real-world evidence with Israeli ministers of health which will allow us to track first real-world evidence for our vaccine in the population. And as you may know, we are the number one to have such data that shows 92% to 95% in real-world evidence vaccine efficacy, primarily seen initially in an older population. That's harder normally to get this stunning data. And it also showed a very low, 0.25 about for both -- 24 and 26 for first and second injection of adverse events. So, really well-performing in a large population of millions of individuals. And of course, that will also track if there are breakthrough infections. Now, in general, I think, it has been claimed that South African and Brazil variants are more difficult-to-treat. And vaccines that have lower antibody levels will have much more breakthroughs, given that the mRNA vaccines have a high antibody levels. And that was, I think, implied in Albert's answer. We expect them to be much more resistant to breakthroughs for a longer time. And I think, data from several labs shows that if you maintain with mRNA vaccines, high antibody levels, you will actually protect very well even against those variants. And that suggests -- and we are just embarking on such studies that you could boost with the current vaccine, a further time and avoid some of these breakthrough infections that were reported recently in some vaccine studies. That would be our aspiration to demonstrate that by keeping individuals with very high titers, you can really impact. And that can be recorded, as you asked in various systems that are now in place in many countries. And that could be a very important way to transit into a more sustained protection, sustained business model where the moderating allows you to plan when the next boost should happen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So, my first question is, if the COVID vaccine becomes routine, how do you think governments and physicians will choose amongst these different vaccines that have received emergency use authorization? And then, how do you think about that 95% efficacy rate in light of mutations? And the last question is on your PCV20, if it's approved, what do you expect the ACIP recommendation to be your -- what would you ideally like it to be? And, do you think there will be any upgrade for those 65-plus due to additional serotypes?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Why don't we start with PCV20, Angela, and then we can come back to COVID. Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. So, in terms of PCV20, I mean, what we believe our value there is the additional serotype and that in the adult, these additional serotypes are meaningful because it will give us 33% more protection against strains causing IPD in adults, and 42% more protection against strains causing IPD for pediatrics. So, we feel that this is very value-creating and provides us the opportunity to really bring an important option into the market that is an upgrade compared to what it is that we have today. And then, to your question about ACIP, of course, we're working closely with the FDA for approval, and with the CDC at the right moments in time to get the right recommendation. We believe that the recommendation will be positive as it pertains to PCV20, and we look forward to working with them to achieve that.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Now, as regards to the how people could choose or physicians could choose if that is a routine. I believe that if this is a routine, the decision will come as with all other vaccines and medicines, the strength of the data. I think that this is why I made before the comments that given that we are first could mean that we are vaccinating a lot of people right now with the first doses. Given that we have such a strong safety and efficacy and database in an open choice situation, we will get the vast majority of the share of choices. But, I think, we'll come reality, likely after in 2022, when the governments do their whole vaccination scheme. And also in that year, there will be ample, I believe, capacity. So, volume will not be a case, even if everyone wants to get one vaccine, I think, will be enough to make this one vaccine. What about the 95% efficacy in terms of variants? I think, we answered that. But, Mikael, maybe you want to reiterate once more why the higher the efficacy, the better it\u2019s, not only for the current, but also for the variants.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, very brief. It's clear from convalescent plasma studies that\u2019s now the last couple of weeks, been out and also from plasma from vaccine recipient, higher antibody levels seems to protect from variants in the preclinical studies from patients. So, I think, it will project into the vaccines with high antibody levels and T-cell immunity, which are an additional protection mechanism, will do very well against variants and keep boosting them, will keep the variants off the population for a longer time before there is any need to shift to variant selective. So, I think, the data we have with mRNA vaccine put them really in a unique category, having the strong immune response, the ability to boost and the ability to, if needed, reconfigure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I want to hit up on two different topics. One, as we think about possible new vaccine for the new variants, do you guys have plans in place? Are you working on it right now? Should we anticipate some sort of Phase 1 data by some point in this early summer? And, has there been a consideration to allocate some of this 2 billion in doses capacity to a new version of vaccine? And separately, going back to the Phase 3 you reported, it's been a few weeks. And, one of the questions I've had is, of the patients that tested positive on the vaccine, post dose two, what did we learn about what mutations those patients had on deep sequencing? What did we learn about their NAb titers and T cells? And I wonder if there's anything we can draw on correlate of protection. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Umer, very, very good, excellent questions. Mikael, do you want to take the last one and also the first one, and then I can speak then later on the manufacturing piece.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. With variants, we are embarking on a study, which will give a boost after 6 months, and possibly also compared with a 12-month dose, we'll compare the wild type, the current vaccine with a variant vaccine, likely based on the 484, I mean from Brazil and South Africa. I think that given the data are so strong with our vaccine, as we alluded to, it may very well be that the third boost at the proper time point is sufficient, and you continue to monitor variant. But, we will be prepared, if needed with data, as you said, around early summer. Quality protection is something we're working with a lot of scientists, not just looking at data in our trial, but in public consortium with INH, looking at data across many trials, and we will see the outcome. I expect, again, high antibody levels, plus T cell immunity will provide the best durability. And that makes us very optimistic about the unique profile of mRNA vaccine.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And the 2 billion doses that we\u2019re speaking about, it is clearly for this current vaccine, and clearly also we are working to see if we can improve that even further. But, right now, we are at our commitment of 2 billion doses. But the reason why we had selected mRNA in the first place was because it simplifies tremendous of this type of process. Our ability with this technology to build a new construct of the same vaccine by just changing the RNA -- messenger RNA within this vaccine, it is really a very, very simple process in terms of manufacturing and in terms of actually developing it. Now, nothing is simple in biology, when you speak about high, complicated processes. But relatively to any other technology, this is very simple. So, I wouldn't say that I would anticipate a major -- if we have to go to a new vaccine, that we will have a major stake up in our manufacturing capacity. I think of around 2 billion doses, could be -- and maybe a little bit less if we start producing new vaccine, replace altogether the new variants, altogether, cumulatively new, and the old, if there is a need to do a new.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: And unfortunately, we'll continue a little bit on this thing. Mikael, could you give us a sense of whether you think the so-called South African and Brazilian variants that have similar mutations, represent terminal or near-terminal adaptations of the virus, or do you think that we will see sort of almost recurring and infinite adaptations that we may have to contemplate adapting the vaccines too? And then, secondly, have you contemplated giving a single dose of vaccine to those who previously been infected, given what's probably 20% to 25% antibody positivity in the U.S. population? And lastly, could your next-gen variant vaccine be refrigerator stable? Thanks.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you. Yes, the first strains like the UK strain was mainly selected for transmissibility to spread quickly. As there were previously infected people in South Africa and Brazil, the new strains have been selected for immune escape, which is the 484; I mean that is the most important. High antibody titers, as alluded to before, from our vaccine seems still to be able to react quite nicely with that strain, although at somewhat more moderate reduction. And we think keeping high titer up in patients will be a very good carry forward approach, until there is a need for a strain change. Now with that concept, the up high antibody titer, you should immunize whether you have had infection or not twice. That gives you maximum titer and allows you to fight off variant strains for as long time as possible before you may need a boost, or after some time that there may be any reason to a variant vaccine, as Albert alluded to. And, we are currently initiating study to understand when a third immunization would be helpful for participants, and we will be studying 6 to 12 months as initial assumption. And, of course, we continue to make efforts to make refrigerated vaccines that include lyophilization or portable liquid with a stabilized product. And we think, end of this year or early next year, we'll have such a product.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.\nVamil Divan: Maybe I'll just shift gears a little bit off the vaccine, I guess somewhat tied to vaccine, but a little different angle here. In terms of capital allocation, Albert, you were mentioning that no change to your strategy. So, the vaccine obviously is going to give you a boost to your sales and cash flow, at least in the near-term here. So, I'm just wondering, should we expect Pfizer to be maybe more active and complete more transactions in the coming months to just try and boost your pipeline than you otherwise might have been, or if not, I guess, just anything you could sort of comment on your kind of thoughts around this added cash flow, and what you might look to do there? And then, my second question is on Vyndamax, where it looks like you are having pretty good traction there, maybe better than we thought given the pandemic. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe comment to where this product is now relative to where maybe you would have expected a year ago, sort of pre-pandemic. I'm trying to get a sense, there are real sort of bolus of patients or you could maybe make more traction as the pandemic eases, or are you already doing quite well in terms of gaining penetration into those patients now, so we should sort of expect the same sort of state of uptake going forward? So, any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Vamil, and thank you also for asking something outside COVID vaccine, at least makes it very interesting. So, you're right, the capital allocation, it is the result of our strategy. And if anything, the COVID-19 is proven our strategy correct. It is, I think, a demonstration that we do have reserves and that has the resources of a big biopharma and the agility of a small biotech. I don't think that many people would bet that Pfizer will be the first one to complete something like that. But, this is what we are building in the last few years, and this is the demonstration that we are there. So, our capital allocation, we never say never. But, right now, the dividend will be maintained. Frank was very clear about it, a growing dividend. It is an important thing -- part of our investment thesis. And we will continue in very intensive reasons to try to bring in Phase 2, Phase 3 predominantly, programs that through our R&D machine very quickly and very successfully can become medicines and vaccines that could generate revenues that will fill the gap. But, from the 6%, so we can sustain the 6% beyond 2025. Nothing changes also -- we do have higher flexibility in terms of cash, with COVID, clearly. But, it is not that we were lacking cash before and we couldn't do basically things that we wanted to do. And now, that makes it even more comfortable to do that. Still, I don't think, because you have this comfort level, we will do things that do not respect the fact that these are shareholders' money. So we will invest them very prudently. We are not going to spend them. But, we are clearly ready to take risks when needed and also clearly ready to pay a full price for things that we really want. And, as I said before, we never say never. So, Angela, how do you see Vyndamax evolving? Was there a bolus? Is it something that we continue growing? What are your views on that?\nAngela Hwang: So, we have been really pleased with what we've seen with Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and the patients that we have been able to diagnose. And, I think, this has gone better than we thought actually, even with the pandemic. Currently, this last quarter, we were able to diagnose 21% of the population with ATTR-CM. And so, the increase, that we've seen quarter-over-quarter, gives us a lot of confidence that our ability to diagnose and the imaging techniques that are being used, the noninvasive techniques are working really well. I would say the bolus is gone. That was something that was maybe in the first half of -- from the -- first half of the year when we launched. And I think where we are now is in a pretty good cadence of using our suspect and detect techniques, as well as the ability to refer to imaging centers to get the diagnosis. And I think that our success rate in diagnosis is evidence of this. And so, I think, we'll continue to see cadence like this. But, of course, there's still massive opportunity, 80% more patients still to be diagnosed. And so, we're really focused now on using technologies and different techniques to heighten and to look and to screen more effectively for patients, because once we know that once we can find them, they can get diagnosed. So, that's where our focus is going to continue to be in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions. On the mRNA platform, you talked about leveraging that technology and outside -- there is outside of a COVID vaccine. And I think you mentioned something like seasonal flu. I'm guessing timelines for any of those types of opportunities would be more normal. And I'm hoping you can kind of give us some idea, just a rough time line on when Pfizer and BioNTech might launch a non-COVID mRNA vaccine product, totally unrelated to COVID-19. I'm guessing that would be something like five years away at a minimum, but maybe you can shed some light on that. And then, second question, just on guidance for 2021 and the other income line, a big number, $2.2 billion, very much above the normal run rate for that line item. You mentioned the consumer JV and ViiV and Viatris all going into that. The only brand-new piece there is Viatris. So, can you just give us more details why that number goes so high in 2021, and importantly, what's the run rate for that line item beyond 2021?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, Tim. Obviously, Frank will answer the second one and Mikael, the first one. Let me also just make an introductory comment before I ask Mikael to speak about flu. I believe that COVID thing has created a new normal. I don't think I will -- we are aspiring here in Pfizer to go back in the old normal of developing timelines, even if we were, as you saw before, at the top of the industry benchmarks, right? So if COVID, why not with cancer; if COVID, why not with flu? And I think that clearly, with COVID, there was the collaboration of regulators that made that also possible, but it was a lot of other things that we have tested. And we did differently than before. So, our aspiration is that these learnings will be clearly applied to everything in our portfolio and in our pipeline. Now, with that, Mikael, tell us a little bit how you see the timelines, where are we with the flu?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you, Albert. And I think you said it well that the type of light speed approach is with the mRNA platform should, of course, be projected into other areas as well as flu. So, Tim, you mentioned 2025, I think that it would be more conservative and traditionally realistic goal, and we are looking at ways to bring it as a potential product for approval earlier than 2025. Of course, it depends on whether there are good flu seasons with the cases coming along or not. And I think, as life continues with vaccinated folks, flu will take up new momentum. So, our aim is ahead of 2025.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Albert, I'll answer on the other income. So, Tim, let me run the numbers first, and then I'll answer the question. So, you talked about the absolute size of the number in 2021 guidance. Remember, in 2020, our other income was about $1.5 billion in adjusted results. So, it's going from about $1.5 billion to the guidance we gave, which was about $2.2 billion. The major elements in the increase are really transition service agreement recoveries, and that's primarily now as a result of closing the Viatris transaction, higher joint venture income, and then, we had some pension expense benefits as well. Those are the pieces that really get us from the, call it, $1.5 billion in 2020 to the $2.2 billion of guidance in 2021. And then, you asked about beyond '21 I think the way to think about beyond '21, just in terms of the cadence, so the rhythm of that number is, the watch item for us will be what happens with the consumer joint venture relative to what GSK decides to do with their portion of that venture. We own 32% of that venture. So, we'll have to see what GSK does. And obviously, depending on what they do, that could impact our other income number going forward, beyond that. So, that's kind of the -- I'll call it, the watch item for us in that line item.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, everyone. This is Jason on for Jeff. Real quickly, sorry to move back to COVID. But, Frank, if you could talk a little bit about the vaccine, at least at a high level, about how the marginal contributions will change over time as manufacturing scales? I just want to get a better sense of the intermediate to longer term, if COVID does ultimately transition to more of an endemic versus the pandemic. And then, secondly, we wanted to ask about next steps for Xeljanz after the recent safety data. Is the assumption here that the label will include these new data? Thanks so much.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much. Frank?\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: So, let me -- Jason, let me do it this way. Let me talk about kind of how the current margins work, and then I'll pivot to how they can work going forward. So, in terms of the current margins, I always start with, we're in a pandemic pricing environment. So, the one price that we published is the price with the U.S. of $19.50 per dose. Obviously, that's not a normal price, like we typically get for a vaccine, $150, $175 per dose. So, pandemic pricing, then what are the takeaways from that? Obviously, there's the direct material, the labor, the factory overhead, shipping, distribution, then obviously, royalty assumptions we've made and then the 50% gross profit payment that we pay to our partner BioNTech. Then, you layer in on top of that some marketing and sales expense and medical expense, some R&D expense, and you come out with the high-20s in terms of that as a percentage of revenue, what we guided to. That's kind of the existing financials for the vaccine. Now, let's go beyond a pandemic pricing environment, the environment we're currently in. Obviously, we're going to get more on price. And clearly, to your point, the more volume we put through our factories, the lower unit cost will become. So, clearly, there is a significant opportunity for those margins to improve, once we get beyond the pandemic environment that we're in.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, Frank. And then, Angela, would you like to take also the Xeljanz?\nAngela Hwang: So, as it pertains to the label for Xeljanz, this is something that we don't have any sense of yet. This was a big study, 1133 was a big study, five years, 4,500 people. We only have the co-primary endpoints that we shared with you. We still have a lot of work to do in terms of secondary endpoints, subpopulations and bringing all of this together to discuss this with regulators. So, I think, we're still a ways off in terms of really understanding what impact they will be to our label. And certainly, we'll keep you posted.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on very impressive progress on COVID. I got two questions, and they are both of the things that you haven't done. The first one is development of JAK for RA. Obviously, you've got a really versatile platform for developing JAK. And especially with an eye to the Xeljanz safety issue, it seems interesting. It should be interesting for you to consider a second generation JAK in that core largest I&I market. So, any thoughts about development there, and any if there is, what will be the requirements for you? The second one is about PD-1 approaches. You are participating in that market, somewhat congenitally, if I had to put it that way. We've seen a couple of the other large pharma companies like Lilly and Novartis, bringing in PD-1 simply as a base platform for combinations or maybe as a low-cost alternative in the current market. Have you considered that approach, and where do you come out on this issue?\nDr. Albert Bourla: I think, Mikael and John could provide some insight here. So, Mikael, why don't you start a little bit with more scientific information? And then, John, you can summarize our strategy for JAKs and PD-1 as\u2026?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you. Our ritlecitinib, which is a completely unique JAK3-TEC inhibitor actually in a Phase 2, already did deliver a really interesting profile. We have a study ongoing with that Phase 2 ritlecitinib by itself and combined with a second molecule, IRAK4, to see if we can use a step-change improvement in RA. Please recall also that we just communicated that ritlecitinib had really strong data in ulcerative colitis. So, that product could grow very strongly in IBD as an option, but will continue in RA. I'll say just something on our own PD-1, and maybe John can add to additional things we do globally there. We have a very nice kind of best-in-class PD-1 platform, so sasanlimab that was developed in Pfizer that is subcutaneous and has delivered very nice response rates across multiple solid tumors. And we're actually starting a Phase 3 with that one in bladder cancer combining with BCG in order to improve outcomes for those patients. Thank you.\nJohn Young: Thank you very much for the question, Ronny. I think Mikael sort of touched on the key points. So, I think, we'd really just sort of highlight that obviously we have our existing partnership on Bavencio or PD-L1. I think, you saw in our release that we confirmed recent approval in Europe for a really interesting indication that could be very valuable for patients. And as Mikael just said, additionally to that, with our own internal program, which is a PD-1, not a PD-L1, it's a PD-1, sasanlimab. In December, in fact, we initiated the study that Mikael just mentioned. And I think the thing that we are very excited about in terms of its potential for sasanlimab is that it's a subcutaneous PD-1. We think the marketplace for more convenient PD-1s is actually still to be developed. Plainly PD-1s, given their efficacy data across a whole range of tumors have enormous potential to be a backbone for the long term. So, we think that as that market evolves, the opportunity for a PD-1 has effectiveness, which has been proven across multiple other compounds, but also combined significant convenience enhancements is actually very significant. So, we're very excited about sasanlimab, and we will keep you updated with progress as that program develops.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob: A couple of questions for Frank and one for Mikael, if I may. Frank, just wondering if you -- if there was any change in inventory in the U.S. during -- between Q3, Q4 of 2021 and -- sorry, 2020, and how does that compare to the change in inventory in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4 and 2019? And then, separately, Frank, the high-20% margins for the COVID vaccine suggests at 100% economics, closer to 50% to -- somewhere between 50% to 60% op margin. But, wondering, because I know, obviously, you're investing a ton into R&D, moving forward into 2022, could we -- how much could we see that operating margin increase over time as R&D spend lowers? And then, for Mikael. Mikael, obviously, a key question that everyone has is durability of efficacy, which is in part affected by new variants. But, how exactly is the agency measuring durability of efficacy or requiring manufacturers or developers to measure durability of efficacy? What specific trials and/or endpoints or how is that characterized, please? Any color would be helpful.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: So, thanks for the question, Navin. So, on the inventory, it's approximately three weeks on hand and roughly the same as it was last year at the end of the year. And in terms of Q3 to Q4, no major change in the rhythm of inventory, roughly approximately three weeks on hand. And then, in terms of the high-20s percentage, it's interesting how you frame the question. Because the way I think about it is, the R&D spend isn't the big -- not the big driver of what's getting us to that high-20s, which is kind of how I heard the question. It's really the COGS. And it's like I said, because primarily, it's the pandemic pricing. And then, the different layers of the COGS that I answered earlier on in the Q&A, that's really what's driving gross, the higher -- the lower IBT as a percentage of margin. So, I think you mentioned 50%. Based on all the current financials, we're lower, significantly lower than 50% on the gross margin. And then, when you layer in the expenses, you get into the high-20s. Now, to your question beyond that, once again, I think, the big factor in it will be the pricing. We'll continue to take the unit cost down as volumes improve. The royalty is what the royalty is. The profit share is the profit share is. Obviously, we're spending R&D, but we'll continue to manage the R&D spend. To me, the big-ticket item there will be what we can do on pricing. And then obviously, the more volume we generate, the lower that will take the unit cost. And those items will clearly drop to the bottom line.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan.\nChris Schott: Just two quick ones here. Maybe on the BCMA bispecific. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see these agents fitting in the treatment paradigm? And maybe, as importantly, how you're seeing the competitive landscape shaping up? So, basically what differentiation do you see with your program versus others? And maybe just then a follow-up on capital allocation priorities, post Upjohn. Share repo has -- the Company has been historically pretty active on that front. Should we think about less or kind of less relevant role for share repo in the paradigm going forward as we think about maybe a little bit higher dividend payout ratio and then some of these priorities to bring in additional assets ahead of the 26 through 28 LOE cycles? Just would love to kind of hear how you see that fitting in the mix? Thanks so much.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Sorry, I was muted. Mikael, would you like to take the first question?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. BCMA or elranatamab, we're very excited about that rig. And this had a high dose 1,000 \u03bcg/kg, 83% response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and it has shown a significant number of stringent or complete responses. And it's given subdued that's a very nice tolerability profile. So, although it's filled with several entrants, I think we have an opportunity to aim for being absolutely in the first wave here and with a really nice best-in-class profile. We're moving with first opportunity we see for accelerated approval in triple refractory patients that either have seen no prior BCMA-based treatment or have seen prior BCMA treatments such as ADC or CAR-T. So, we are planning such cohorts to start soon with a potential for registration. And, we're moving into second and third line, in combination with classical image and other combinations that are used in order to come to first and second-line opportunity, particularly within it.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And Chris, as regards to the stock repurchases, we never say never to anything, right? We don't want to leave any weapons that we will say we never use. But clearly, the share repurchases falls at the bottom of the priorities right now. The dividend is a clear commitment, but of course, you will all know. And we believe there are tremendous opportunities right now to invest in the business. As Frank has said, we have already an authorization from the Board that we could exercise at any point to buy back shares. And we could have a moment ask for a renewal. But, this is not the priority right now. The priority, it is to make sure that we keep investing for business development and for infrastructure. So, for example, our COVID franchise will thrive over time, and our R&D machine will get many more programs from the external world that can run through it. Thank you very much.\nChuck Triano: Thanks. And Albert, did you have some closing remarks?\nDr. Albert Bourla: So, wow, time flies, 11:30. So, thank you very much for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. The new Pfizer is all about two things, science and patience. I think, it's the combination of both, decade-long transformation from a diversified enterprise to more focused and innovative biopharma company. By uniting transformational technology and cutting edge science, we are pioneering biopharmaceutical innovations to do more than just treat difficult diseases. I think, we are curing and preventing them. We believe our success in development COVID-19 was just the beginning. Thanks to the incredible transformation we have executed over the last 10 years, Pfizer is now advancing one of the strongest pipelines in our Company's history. We have 95 potential new therapies or indications in 6 therapeutic areas with 9 programs in registration, 24 in Phase 3 clinical trials. This means 95 potential opportunities to change the lives of patients around the world. And when patients win, we all win. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dr. Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a year like none other in Pfizer's history. With the separation of Upjohn complete, we saw the culmination of Pfizer's decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused Company. Through our collaboration with BioNTech, we delivered the world's first breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine in less than a year. And by harnessing the power of the variety of digital capabilities, we made sure that despite the lockdowns and travel restrictions, we continue to serve patients around the world who rely on our medicines and vaccines. Despite this challenging environment and the incredible amount of resources we devoted to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 8% operational revenue growth for the year from our core biopharmaceutical product portfolio, excluding the revenue impact from consumer healthcare and excluding $154 million in sales of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that we recorded in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that this 8% operational growth includes a negative 2% impact due to the slowdown in macroeconomic and healthcare activity resulting from the pandemic. This operational growth was driven primarily by continued strong performances from Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Oncology Biosimilars, Ibrance, Prevenar 13 outside of the U.S., Inlyta, Xeljanz, and Xtandi, so basically all the growth drivers contributed significantly. David, unfortunately, you are cutting off and I couldn't hear you. Can you repeat the question of the vaccine from the beginning? Thank you, Steve. Let me take the COVID one, and then I will ask Mikael to comment on the Xeljanz first part, and then Angela on the implications from commercial. Steve, we try not to give a low expectation, we try to give a responsible expectation. If we are asking if there is a scenario that we will sell everything, yes, there is. Also, I would tell you that if that was an open market, which means that the physicians and citizens, they have the ability to choose which vaccine they would receive, I would feel very comfortable that we will have the lion market share because we are first and we are best, as you have clearly indicated. And we have great operations in basically every country in the world. But, this is not an open market, at least for this year. This year, it is a market that it is controlled by governments appropriately because I think we are in a crisis, as you know. And also, it is a market that creates a lot of political pressure. So, not always the decisions are sound, solid, and avoiding panic. So, with that in mind, we have a formula that we try to implement in a responsible way that takes into consideration the contracts that we have, the potential for future contracts, but also takes into consideration the strength of the contracts, takes into consideration the potential for other vaccines to present data. And in fact, the reason why we changed our revenue projections, which resulted in $0.10 improvement in our bottom line, is because we did have more news from the AstraZeneca registration and the way that it is perceived in Europe. We had the news from the J&J that reported data. We have much better visibility now in the last two weeks on their manufacturing capabilities, all of that resulted in us increasing our projections. Clearly, there are a lot -- this is a multidimensional, let's say, challenge to have accurate projections. And clearly, we are having dynamic changes, which we will follow, and we will update our estimates as time comes. But, in all honesty, I couldn't responsibly just say right now, we are going to sell everything we can make, the 2 billion, when we have all this dynamic situation that it is evolving. Now, why don't we move to Mikael to talk a little bit about the MACE, on Xeljanz, and then Angela on the revenue expectations. Gregg, thank you very much. I fully agree with you, but I don't think we're receiving a lot of credit, not for the vaccines right now when you see the stock price, but mainly for our basic business and pipeline. This is business that is growing 6% and double-digit, the bottom line, excluding any COVID. And it clearly deserves much, much higher multiple in this industry. The same comes even more when you speak about the COVID-19 vaccine. But, I think, clearly, people should see much more into that. So, to your question, how do we plan to use strategically this platform? I believe that the RNA technology has been proven in a glorious way that will have an impact in treating diseases, in preventing diseases in multiple applications. And I believe Pfizer has accumulated expertise and knowledge of a decade into one year. And also Pfizer has completed infrastructure investments that would take five years, again, into one year. So clearly, we plan to use this expertise so that we will be able to benefit more and more patients. I made some comments that within the COVID vaccine, I believe that COVID is -- the dynamics in the COVID more and more indicate the potential, but we will have a clearly repeated business. The reasons for that are multiple. Let me start by saying, in the beginning, we were waiting to see if the immunity will be durable. Now, we still don't have data about the immunity of our vaccine because it is early, but we do see that the people that have the disease, more and more publications indicate that after several months, the immune response goes down. So, there is a need to boost. Also, there are a lot of papers that have been published that indicate even for the new variants that if you have very high level of immune responses, you are protecting against those values in much higher level than if you have lower levels of these antibodies. So, that indicates that the need to boost or that maintain much higher levels, it's there. And last but not least, it is clear that the scenario that the variants will develop in such a way that they may be escaping very effective protection from the current vaccine, which is not the case right now for us. Then, we're clearly preparing ourselves so that we will produce in a very speedy time and made publicly a statement that that needs to be done end-to-end in less than 100 days to provide new booster vaccines that will protect against the new variant. So, in scenarios like that and even in scenarios that the COVID will move from a pandemic into more of a normal type of vaccination business, it is very clear that Pfizer will have a key advantage, not only because of the strength of the data, but also because we have developed significant brand equity and trust with the people when it comes to their choice. We have infrastructure and expertise that will help us. RNA is not going to provide only COVID-19 vaccines. We are accelerating our work for flu right now. And we are clearly investigating multiple other applications in other vaccines for this RNA technology or therapeutic areas. So, I believe that our business, excluding COVID, is very robust with robust pipeline. But I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting from now. And with that, I will ask Angela to comment on the question about, again, the COVID vaccine. Angela? Yes. Mikael, would you like to take this question, please? Why don't we start with PCV20, Angela, and then we can come back to COVID. Angela? Thank you. Now, as regards to the how people could choose or physicians could choose if that is a routine. I believe that if this is a routine, the decision will come as with all other vaccines and medicines, the strength of the data. I think that this is why I made before the comments that given that we are first could mean that we are vaccinating a lot of people right now with the first doses. Given that we have such a strong safety and efficacy and database in an open choice situation, we will get the vast majority of the share of choices. But, I think, we'll come reality, likely after in 2022, when the governments do their whole vaccination scheme. And also in that year, there will be ample, I believe, capacity. So, volume will not be a case, even if everyone wants to get one vaccine, I think, will be enough to make this one vaccine. What about the 95% efficacy in terms of variants? I think, we answered that. But, Mikael, maybe you want to reiterate once more why the higher the efficacy, the better it's, not only for the current, but also for the variants. Umer, very, very good, excellent questions. Mikael, do you want to take the last one and also the first one, and then I can speak then later on the manufacturing piece. Thank you, Mikael. And the 2 billion doses that we're speaking about, it is clearly for this current vaccine, and clearly also we are working to see if we can improve that even further. But, right now, we are at our commitment of 2 billion doses. But the reason why we had selected mRNA in the first place was because it simplifies tremendous of this type of process. Our ability with this technology to build a new construct of the same vaccine by just changing the RNA -- messenger RNA within this vaccine, it is really a very, very simple process in terms of manufacturing and in terms of actually developing it. Now, nothing is simple in biology, when you speak about high, complicated processes. But relatively to any other technology, this is very simple. So, I wouldn't say that I would anticipate a major -- if we have to go to a new vaccine, that we will have a major stake up in our manufacturing capacity. I think of around 2 billion doses, could be -- and maybe a little bit less if we start producing new vaccine, replace altogether the new variants, altogether, cumulatively new, and the old, if there is a need to do a new. Mikael? Thank you, Vamil, and thank you also for asking something outside COVID vaccine, at least makes it very interesting. So, you're right, the capital allocation, it is the result of our strategy. And if anything, the COVID-19 is proven our strategy correct. It is, I think, a demonstration that we do have reserves and that has the resources of a big biopharma and the agility of a small biotech. I don't think that many people would bet that Pfizer will be the first one to complete something like that. But, this is what we are building in the last few years, and this is the demonstration that we are there. So, our capital allocation, we never say never. But, right now, the dividend will be maintained. Frank was very clear about it, a growing dividend. It is an important thing -- part of our investment thesis. And we will continue in very intensive reasons to try to bring in Phase 2, Phase 3 predominantly, programs that through our R&D machine very quickly and very successfully can become medicines and vaccines that could generate revenues that will fill the gap. But, from the 6%, so we can sustain the 6% beyond 2025. Nothing changes also -- we do have higher flexibility in terms of cash, with COVID, clearly. But, it is not that we were lacking cash before and we couldn't do basically things that we wanted to do. And now, that makes it even more comfortable to do that. Still, I don't think, because you have this comfort level, we will do things that do not respect the fact that these are shareholders' money. So we will invest them very prudently. We are not going to spend them. But, we are clearly ready to take risks when needed and also clearly ready to pay a full price for things that we really want. And, as I said before, we never say never. So, Angela, how do you see Vyndamax evolving? Was there a bolus? Is it something that we continue growing? What are your views on that? Thank you very much, Tim. Obviously, Frank will answer the second one and Mikael, the first one. Let me also just make an introductory comment before I ask Mikael to speak about flu. I believe that COVID thing has created a new normal. I don't think I will -- we are aspiring here in Pfizer to go back in the old normal of developing timelines, even if we were, as you saw before, at the top of the industry benchmarks, right? So if COVID, why not with cancer; if COVID, why not with flu? And I think that clearly, with COVID, there was the collaboration of regulators that made that also possible, but it was a lot of other things that we have tested. And we did differently than before. So, our aspiration is that these learnings will be clearly applied to everything in our portfolio and in our pipeline. Now, with that, Mikael, tell us a little bit how you see the timelines, where are we with the flu? Thank you very much. Frank? Thank you very much, Frank. And then, Angela, would you like to take also the Xeljanz? I think, Mikael and John could provide some insight here. So, Mikael, why don't you start a little bit with more scientific information? And then, John, you can summarize our strategy for JAKs and PD-1 as...? Sorry, I was muted. Mikael, would you like to take the first question? And Chris, as regards to the stock repurchases, we never say never to anything, right? We don't want to leave any weapons that we will say we never use. But clearly, the share repurchases falls at the bottom of the priorities right now. The dividend is a clear commitment, but of course, you will all know. And we believe there are tremendous opportunities right now to invest in the business. As Frank has said, we have already an authorization from the Board that we could exercise at any point to buy back shares. And we could have a moment ask for a renewal. But, this is not the priority right now. The priority, it is to make sure that we keep investing for business development and for infrastructure. So, for example, our COVID franchise will thrive over time, and our R&D machine will get many more programs from the external world that can run through it. Thank you very much. So, wow, time flies, 11:30. So, thank you very much for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. The new Pfizer is all about two things, science and patience. I think, it's the combination of both, decade-long transformation from a diversified enterprise to more focused and innovative biopharma company. By uniting transformational technology and cutting edge science, we are pioneering biopharmaceutical innovations to do more than just treat difficult diseases. I think, we are curing and preventing them. We believe our success in development COVID-19 was just the beginning. Thanks to the incredible transformation we have executed over the last 10 years, Pfizer is now advancing one of the strongest pipelines in our Company's history. We have 95 potential new therapies or indications in 6 therapeutic areas with 9 programs in registration, 24 in Phase 3 clinical trials. This means 95 potential opportunities to change the lives of patients around the world. And when patients win, we all win. Have a great rest of your day."

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Albert, and Steve, for the questions. As you know, the 1133 study for Xeljanz was rather unique population with increased severe risk. Now, Xeljanz has been studied in numerous clinical trials and in the market where a large population has used it in a more general RA population or in ulcerative colitis. And in those populations, it has had a very robust efficacy to safety profile. I think, RA by itself has more CV liabilities, standard RA patients, and this was a very specific subset. Now, going to other JAK inhibitors, the next generation of JAK inhibitors such as abrocitinib in registration for atopic dermatitis, or as Albert reported, ritlecitinib, which is a unique JAK3/TEC inhibitor, each JAK inhibitor differs by itself. And we think both of these two that I mentioned have very encouraging benefit to risk profile. And while regulatory agencies have, in some instances, inferred general class-label across JAKs, I think the experience will tell that abrocitinib for atopic dermatitis has a very compelling efficacy and risk profile and ritlecitinib for alopecia that's reading out later this year or for vitiligo and ulcerative colitis where we have very encouraging Phase 2 data, again, has a unique profile. So, I don't think that we should extend 1133 to other JAKs, and I think we'll also need to look at Xeljanz having a very robust profile in population that was not a smaller version of the 1133 study. Thank you very much. Yes. There are different organized, at the government levels, efforts. In the U.S., the position of sequences both to track new strains, like the South Africa and Brazil, as well among unvaccinated and vaccinated or deposited in certain databases. There is one initiative in UK. And then, of course, Pfizer has the unique collaboration in real-world evidence with Israeli ministers of health which will allow us to track first real-world evidence for our vaccine in the population. And as you may know, we are the number one to have such data that shows 92% to 95% in real-world evidence vaccine efficacy, primarily seen initially in an older population. That's harder normally to get this stunning data. And it also showed a very low, 0.25 about for both -- 24 and 26 for first and second injection of adverse events. So, really well-performing in a large population of millions of individuals. And of course, that will also track if there are breakthrough infections. Now, in general, I think, it has been claimed that South African and Brazil variants are more difficult-to-treat. And vaccines that have lower antibody levels will have much more breakthroughs, given that the mRNA vaccines have a high antibody levels. And that was, I think, implied in Albert's answer. We expect them to be much more resistant to breakthroughs for a longer time. And I think, data from several labs shows that if you maintain with mRNA vaccines, high antibody levels, you will actually protect very well even against those variants. And that suggests -- and we are just embarking on such studies that you could boost with the current vaccine, a further time and avoid some of these breakthrough infections that were reported recently in some vaccine studies. That would be our aspiration to demonstrate that by keeping individuals with very high titers, you can really impact. And that can be recorded, as you asked in various systems that are now in place in many countries. And that could be a very important way to transit into a more sustained protection, sustained business model where the moderating allows you to plan when the next boost should happen. Yes, very brief. It's clear from convalescent plasma studies that's now the last couple of weeks, been out and also from plasma from vaccine recipient, higher antibody levels seems to protect from variants in the preclinical studies from patients. So, I think, it will project into the vaccines with high antibody levels and T-cell immunity, which are an additional protection mechanism, will do very well against variants and keep boosting them, will keep the variants off the population for a longer time before there is any need to shift to variant selective. So, I think, the data we have with mRNA vaccine put them really in a unique category, having the strong immune response, the ability to boost and the ability to, if needed, reconfigure. Yes. With variants, we are embarking on a study, which will give a boost after 6 months, and possibly also compared with a 12-month dose, we'll compare the wild type, the current vaccine with a variant vaccine, likely based on the 484, I mean from Brazil and South Africa. I think that given the data are so strong with our vaccine, as we alluded to, it may very well be that the third boost at the proper time point is sufficient, and you continue to monitor variant. But, we will be prepared, if needed with data, as you said, around early summer. Quality protection is something we're working with a lot of scientists, not just looking at data in our trial, but in public consortium with INH, looking at data across many trials, and we will see the outcome. I expect, again, high antibody levels, plus T cell immunity will provide the best durability. And that makes us very optimistic about the unique profile of mRNA vaccine. Yes. Thank you. Yes, the first strains like the UK strain was mainly selected for transmissibility to spread quickly. As there were previously infected people in South Africa and Brazil, the new strains have been selected for immune escape, which is the 484; I mean that is the most important. High antibody titers, as alluded to before, from our vaccine seems still to be able to react quite nicely with that strain, although at somewhat more moderate reduction. And we think keeping high titer up in patients will be a very good carry forward approach, until there is a need for a strain change. Now with that concept, the up high antibody titer, you should immunize whether you have had infection or not twice. That gives you maximum titer and allows you to fight off variant strains for as long time as possible before you may need a boost, or after some time that there may be any reason to a variant vaccine, as Albert alluded to. And, we are currently initiating study to understand when a third immunization would be helpful for participants, and we will be studying 6 to 12 months as initial assumption. And, of course, we continue to make efforts to make refrigerated vaccines that include lyophilization or portable liquid with a stabilized product. And we think, end of this year or early next year, we'll have such a product. Yes. Thank you, Albert. And I think you said it well that the type of light speed approach is with the mRNA platform should, of course, be projected into other areas as well as flu. So, Tim, you mentioned 2025, I think that it would be more conservative and traditionally realistic goal, and we are looking at ways to bring it as a potential product for approval earlier than 2025. Of course, it depends on whether there are good flu seasons with the cases coming along or not. And I think, as life continues with vaccinated folks, flu will take up new momentum. So, our aim is ahead of 2025. Yes. Thank you. Our ritlecitinib, which is a completely unique JAK3-TEC inhibitor actually in a Phase 2, already did deliver a really interesting profile. We have a study ongoing with that Phase 2 ritlecitinib by itself and combined with a second molecule, IRAK4, to see if we can use a step-change improvement in RA. Please recall also that we just communicated that ritlecitinib had really strong data in ulcerative colitis. So, that product could grow very strongly in IBD as an option, but will continue in RA. I'll say just something on our own PD-1, and maybe John can add to additional things we do globally there. We have a very nice kind of best-in-class PD-1 platform, so sasanlimab that was developed in Pfizer that is subcutaneous and has delivered very nice response rates across multiple solid tumors. And we're actually starting a Phase 3 with that one in bladder cancer combining with BCG in order to improve outcomes for those patients. Thank you. Yes. BCMA or elranatamab, we're very excited about that rig. And this had a high dose 1,000 \u03bcg/kg, 83% response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and it has shown a significant number of stringent or complete responses. And it's given subdued that's a very nice tolerability profile. So, although it's filled with several entrants, I think we have an opportunity to aim for being absolutely in the first wave here and with a really nice best-in-class profile. We're moving with first opportunity we see for accelerated approval in triple refractory patients that either have seen no prior BCMA-based treatment or have seen prior BCMA treatments such as ADC or CAR-T. So, we are planning such cohorts to start soon with a potential for registration. And, we're moving into second and third line, in combination with classical image and other combinations that are used in order to come to first and second-line opportunity, particularly within it."

            "name": "Frank D'Amelio",
            "content": "Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. We again saw a very solid revenue growth for the business in the quarter and the year, which continues to support our projected 6%-plus revenue CAGR through the end of 2025. As a reminder, this growth projection excludes any contribution from the COVID vaccine. In terms of the price and volume mix for the year, the grow up of the 8% operational growth we posted, excluding consumer healthcare and the COVID vaccine, our underlying Biopharmaceuticals portfolio generated 10% volume growth, offset by a negative 2% price impact. So, continued very strong volume overall. Foreign exchange had a slightly positive impact on revenue in the quarter with a 1% benefit for the full year, while for the full year, we saw an overall negative impact of 1%. So, 1% positive for the quarter, 1% negative for the full year. Now, moving down the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were lower in the quarter, mainly due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, product mix and unfavorable year-over-year impact of cash flow hedging on inventory and COVID-related expenses. However, it's important to note that on an annual basis, adjusted gross margin for 2020 was within 90 basis points of 2019 and around 80%. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the quarter were lower by 2% on an operational basis and lower by 10% on an annual basis. There remain two main factors that drive the decrease for the year, the exclusion of consumer health and lower selling expenses due to COVID, and to a lesser extent, the early implementation of a planned reduction in spending associated with our corporate-enabling functions. Adjusted R&D expenses grew 24% in the quarter and 15% for the year on an operational basis. This growth was primarily driven by our investment in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was up significantly compared to the prior year quarter, mainly driven by lower asset impairment charges compared to the year ago quarter. For the year, reported earnings were lower, mainly due to the non-recurrence of the gain on the consumer joint venture formation in 2019. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% for the quarter and 20% for the year on an operational basis. I'd add that our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $2.22, which is below the range of $2.28 to $2.38 we had given in terms of new Pfizer financials on a full year basis. I just want to remind you that we had indicated on last quarter's earnings call that our actual reported numbers would be lower than the guidance because the guidance assumed full year of operating without Upjohn as well as assuming a full year benefit of transitional service agreement recoveries and lower interest expenses from the deployment of the $12 billion in proceeds to pay down debt. So with the deal not closing until November, we only had a small benefit from these factors in our reported 2020 financials. Now, let's move to our 2021 guidance. We provided total Company guidance, which includes the COVID vaccine, and then we provided some additional sub-ledger detail on our assumptions regarding the projected COVID vaccine contribution, so you can also get a read on the business out. In terms of revenue, we are projecting a range of $59.4 billion to $61.4 billion, which includes a foreign exchange benefit of approximately $1.4 billion. And at the guidance range midpoint represents operational growth of 41% from 2020. For adjusted cost of goods, the range is 32% to 33% as a percentage of revenue, which incorporates the COVID vaccine, gross profit share payment to BioNTech, as well as some other related items I will speak to in a moment. On a side end, what we see is the impact of increased sales and marketing expense behind key growth brands as well as for expected product launches, led by our enabling function, cost savings. In addition, we see growth in R&D, which follows along with our pipeline development cadence. And I note, given our clinical trial success metrics Albert referenced, we're confident about making sound R&D investments. Adjusted other income and deductions is projected at just over $2 billion of income. In addition to the usual items included here, remind you for modeling purpose that three larger items in terms of income are our GSK consumer healthcare joint venture equity income, ViiV dividend income and transition service agreement recoveries, primarily related to Viatris. Working this through with our projected 15% tax rate yield and adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.10 to $3.20 with 38% operational growth at the midpoint. This range is a bit higher than what we discussed three weeks ago and was driven mainly by an increase in our COVID vaccine sales projections since then. Let me offer some assumptions and context on the projected COVID vaccine financial contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine collaboration construct is a 50-50 gross profit split. Pfizer will book the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, and we do not participate in China. We continue to expect that we can manufacture up to 2 billion doses in 2021. However, given it's still early in the year, we are not projecting that we will sell all those doses. Ultimately, we made contract of all the doses, but for the purposes for our initial guidance, we primarily included doses that are covered by strong supply agreements with various governments. On this, we currently forecast approximately $15 billion in COVID vaccine revenue, as which is what you see here. Given we remain in negotiations for additional contracts, we are not providing the number of doses behind the revenue estimate. Our cost of sales for the COVID vaccine revenue will include manufacturing and distribution costs, a royalty payment allowance as well as a payment to BioNTech, representing the 50% gross profit split. All-in, this yields an anticipated income before tax COVID vaccine in the high 20% range. Let me add that if we contract for additional -- if we contract with the delivery of additional doses during the year, we will provide a guidance update in our subsequent earnings releases. If we remove the projected COVID vaccine contribution and related impacts on revenue, that results in our business having 2021 projected annual revenue between $44.4 billion and $46.6 billion. So, 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint, and about 8% if we include the current favorable impact of foreign exchange compared to last year. In terms of adjusted cost of goods, net of the COVID vaccine, we see a range between 21% and 22% as a percentage of revenues. For adjusted diluted EPS, we see a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents 11% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent with how we've been publicly positioning the business subsequent to the Upjohn separation. In terms of reporting our quarterly earnings, we are not going to report two sets of financials, one with COVID and one without. But, I think the context in terms of the vaccine margins will be helpful in calculating a good estimate of the adjusted diluted EPS impact, based on the COVID vaccine revenue, we will report in future earnings releases. Let me speak for a moment about our dividend going forward and how it will initially be linked to the Viatris dividend once it is declared. To make it simple, let's start with Pfizer's current annualized dividend rate of $1.56 per share. A Pfizer shareholder owning 100 shares just prior to the spin-off, would now still own their 100 shares of Pfizer and also 12 shares of Viatris, assuming they have continued to hold the Viatris shares. The 100 shares of Pfizer would generate $156 in annual dividend income. And currently, the 12 shares of Viatris do not generate any dividend income. This $156 in annual dividend income is what we will preserve. Once Viatris declares its dividend, we will calculate the annual income generated by the 12 shares of Viatris, and then adjust the Pfizer dividend, so the combined annual income generated from the 100 shares of Pfizer and 12 shares of Viatris, totals at least that $156 in 2021. For the foreseeable future, we expect our Board to continue to support annual dividend increases at approximately this year's level. Obviously, we have no say as to what Viatris does with its future dividend. I hope this example is helpful. In summary, we had a strong 2020. The separation of Upjohn is behind us. The business is on track for solid top and bottom line growth. And we are highly focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting and market brands, and looking to deploy capital responsibly with a focus on initiatives that can solidify our long-term revenue and earnings growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Albert, I'll answer on the other income. So, Tim, let me run the numbers first, and then I'll answer the question. So, you talked about the absolute size of the number in 2021 guidance. Remember, in 2020, our other income was about $1.5 billion in adjusted results. So, it's going from about $1.5 billion to the guidance we gave, which was about $2.2 billion. The major elements in the increase are really transition service agreement recoveries, and that's primarily now as a result of closing the Viatris transaction, higher joint venture income, and then, we had some pension expense benefits as well. Those are the pieces that really get us from the, call it, $1.5 billion in 2020 to the $2.2 billion of guidance in 2021. And then, you asked about beyond '21 I think the way to think about beyond '21, just in terms of the cadence, so the rhythm of that number is, the watch item for us will be what happens with the consumer joint venture relative to what GSK decides to do with their portion of that venture. We own 32% of that venture. So, we'll have to see what GSK does. And obviously, depending on what they do, that could impact our other income number going forward, beyond that. So, that's kind of the -- I'll call it, the watch item for us in that line item. So, let me -- Jason, let me do it this way. Let me talk about kind of how the current margins work, and then I'll pivot to how they can work going forward. So, in terms of the current margins, I always start with, we're in a pandemic pricing environment. So, the one price that we published is the price with the U.S. of $19.50 per dose. Obviously, that's not a normal price, like we typically get for a vaccine, $150, $175 per dose. So, pandemic pricing, then what are the takeaways from that? Obviously, there's the direct material, the labor, the factory overhead, shipping, distribution, then obviously, royalty assumptions we've made and then the 50% gross profit payment that we pay to our partner BioNTech. Then, you layer in on top of that some marketing and sales expense and medical expense, some R&D expense, and you come out with the high-20s in terms of that as a percentage of revenue, what we guided to. That's kind of the existing financials for the vaccine. Now, let's go beyond a pandemic pricing environment, the environment we're currently in. Obviously, we're going to get more on price. And clearly, to your point, the more volume we put through our factories, the lower unit cost will become. So, clearly, there is a significant opportunity for those margins to improve, once we get beyond the pandemic environment that we're in. So, thanks for the question, Navin. So, on the inventory, it's approximately three weeks on hand and roughly the same as it was last year at the end of the year. And in terms of Q3 to Q4, no major change in the rhythm of inventory, roughly approximately three weeks on hand. And then, in terms of the high-20s percentage, it's interesting how you frame the question. Because the way I think about it is, the R&D spend isn't the big -- not the big driver of what's getting us to that high-20s, which is kind of how I heard the question. It's really the COGS. And it's like I said, because primarily, it's the pandemic pricing. And then, the different layers of the COGS that I answered earlier on in the Q&A, that's really what's driving gross, the higher -- the lower IBT as a percentage of margin. So, I think you mentioned 50%. Based on all the current financials, we're lower, significantly lower than 50% on the gross margin. And then, when you layer in the expenses, you get into the high-20s. Now, to your question beyond that, once again, I think, the big factor in it will be the pricing. We'll continue to take the unit cost down as volumes improve. The royalty is what the royalty is. The profit share is the profit share is. Obviously, we're spending R&D, but we'll continue to manage the R&D spend. To me, the big-ticket item there will be what we can do on pricing. And then obviously, the more volume we generate, the lower that will take the unit cost. And those items will clearly drop to the bottom line."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Thanks, Mikael. And then, just building off of what Mikael has said. As you know, we have a very robust data set that has been built around Xeljanz for over seven years, 50 different clinical trials, 260,000 patients that are currently on Xeljanz, and of course, a very robust real-world data set that goes along with these 260,000 patients. So, I think based on all of this and together with the fact that we are still so early on in our understanding of the 1133 data as it pertains to Xeljanz that we feel confident that Xeljanz will remain an important part of the treatment paradigm for RA patients and for patients with PsA and UC as well, and that it has an appropriate and favorable benefit risk profile for this sort of patient population type. And so, of course, we will share the data with you as we continue to learn more about the study. But for now, that's how we see it. And then, I think you had one more question in terms of how do we think about this in terms of impact on our other JAKs. And as Mikael said, scientifically, each one of these molecules are very different. And they're all being designed with a different benefit risk profile to match the different disease condition as well as the different patient types. And so, I think as a result, we continue to be very confident about our JAK portfolio and the investments that we're making in each one of these. And we think that what we will be able to deliver are differentiated profiles that will be appropriate and fit-for-purpose for that condition and for that patient type. Thanks for the question. And I think, what you're talking about is vaccine confidence, which clearly has been a big topic since the vaccine was introduced. And I'm actually really encouraged by data that we're receiving on a routine basis that is demonstrating that vaccine confidence is indeed building, and that compared to where we were even a month ago, we've had a significant rise in interest and willingness of the public to get vaccinated. And I think, a lot of this is driven, obviously, by real-world experience by many people who are now getting the vaccine and having good experiences with them. So, I think that this will continue. To your question about what is it that we're doing to drive awareness and demand? I think, first of all, we have to understand that right now, we are in a period where we are operating under an EUA, the emergency approval. So, there is guardrail as it pertains to that and what it is that we can do. For sure, we have worked very diligently with many, many, many medical and public health societies and institutions to ensure that we are supporting education across the entire country. There recently was even a public service announcement that was launched where it had our support in conjunction with a number of patient advocacy groups to really educate and to create confidence for the public around this vaccine. In addition to that, at a more specific level, Pfizer uniquely has really supported the healthcare professional community in its vaccination by providing a lot of training, a lot of support to ensure that confidence is gained at the vaccination side. And actually, just to share that over 30,000 HCPs have been trained by Pfizer alone in the recent month or so to be able to confidently vaccinate these -- vaccinate people. And I think that that's also helping to create confidence. But, of course, where we can get most involved and we'll be able to do even more, is once we receive BLA. And so, we're working towards that. And we will build on the education initiatives that we already have in place, but we'll be able to amplify that even more, once we have a full label. Thank you. Sure. So, in terms of PCV20, I mean, what we believe our value there is the additional serotype and that in the adult, these additional serotypes are meaningful because it will give us 33% more protection against strains causing IPD in adults, and 42% more protection against strains causing IPD for pediatrics. So, we feel that this is very value-creating and provides us the opportunity to really bring an important option into the market that is an upgrade compared to what it is that we have today. And then, to your question about ACIP, of course, we're working closely with the FDA for approval, and with the CDC at the right moments in time to get the right recommendation. We believe that the recommendation will be positive as it pertains to PCV20, and we look forward to working with them to achieve that. So, we have been really pleased with what we've seen with Vyndaqel/Vyndamax and the patients that we have been able to diagnose. And, I think, this has gone better than we thought actually, even with the pandemic. Currently, this last quarter, we were able to diagnose 21% of the population with ATTR-CM. And so, the increase, that we've seen quarter-over-quarter, gives us a lot of confidence that our ability to diagnose and the imaging techniques that are being used, the noninvasive techniques are working really well. I would say the bolus is gone. That was something that was maybe in the first half of -- from the -- first half of the year when we launched. And I think where we are now is in a pretty good cadence of using our suspect and detect techniques, as well as the ability to refer to imaging centers to get the diagnosis. And I think that our success rate in diagnosis is evidence of this. And so, I think, we'll continue to see cadence like this. But, of course, there's still massive opportunity, 80% more patients still to be diagnosed. And so, we're really focused now on using technologies and different techniques to heighten and to look and to screen more effectively for patients, because once we know that once we can find them, they can get diagnosed. So, that's where our focus is going to continue to be in 2021. So, as it pertains to the label for Xeljanz, this is something that we don't have any sense of yet. This was a big study, 1133 was a big study, five years, 4,500 people. We only have the co-primary endpoints that we shared with you. We still have a lot of work to do in terms of secondary endpoints, subpopulations and bringing all of this together to discuss this with regulators. So, I think, we're still a ways off in terms of really understanding what impact they will be to our label. And certainly, we'll keep you posted."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nChuck Triano: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2020 financial results our updated 2020 financial guidance Pfizer's role in helping find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; and Mikael Dolsten our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Worldwide Research Development and Medical; Angela Hwang Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.

Forward-looking statements on this call speak only as of the original date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chuck and good morning everyone. A great day here in New York. During my remarks, I will discuss our strong third quarter business performance, speak to the progress we are making in the battle against COVID-19, provide an update on our pipeline and how it is setting us up for an anticipated period of sustained growth, and briefly touch on the topic of affordable access to innovative medicines and vaccines. Let's start with an update on our Biopharmaceutical Group. For the quarter, revenues in our biopharma business grew 4% operationally driven primarily by the ongoing strong performance of Vyndaqel/Vyndamax; growth from our leading portfolio of biosimilars; and the continued strength of key brands including Eliquis, IBRANCE, Xeljanz, Inlyta, and XTANDI.\nFrank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the quarterly financials. Our Biopharma business, which will become new Pfizer, following the close of the Upjohn transaction, generated $10.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, which represented 84% of total company revenue. On an operational basis, Biopharma revenue grew 4% in the quarter and 7% for the first nine months of the year. The 7% year-to-date operational revenue growth for Biopharma was driven by continued solid volume growth and our price-to-volume mix was a 9% increase in volume and a 2% negative impact from price. For Upjohn, although the year-over-year comparison is skewed again by the impact of generic Lyrica and changes in the China market, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations and assumptions already reflected in our Upjohn guidance for the year. Now moving down the income statement. I'll touch quickly on gross margin, which saw a slight negative impact during the quarter, mainly driven by lower sales from Lyrica, Celebrex, Lipitor and Norvasc, which are all part of our Upjohn business, as well as some incremental costs due to COVID 19. There was some offset to this impact due to lower inventory write-offs compared to the year ago quarter. We had another quarter where we saw a significant year-over-year decline in adjusted SI&A expenses, which were down 10% operationally. There are two obvious factors at work here: the exclusion of consumer health expenses and lower selling expenses due to COVID; but also a third factor, which is a planned reduction in spending associated with our corporate-enabling functions. We're in the midst of aligning those functions to the new Pfizer structure, which will be a smaller and less complex organization. We are finalizing this initiative and we'll be able to better quantify the expected financial benefit when we provide our 2021 financial guidance for new Pfizer. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was down significantly compared to the year ago quarter, mainly driven by the non-recurrence of a one-time gain from the consumer joint venture formation in the year ago quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was down 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.01 lower compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenues in the quarter by about $100 million or 1%. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance a few points here regarding our assumptions. The guidance continues to only include the adverse spending on our COVID vaccine candidate, but does not include any potential revenue we may receive this year if the vaccine is authorized and we deliver doses to various governments where we have agreements. In terms of our broader COVID-related assumptions, we expect the gradual recovery in healthcare activity for the remainder of the year. I'd also note that upon the closing of the Upjohn transaction, we will treat the Upjohn business as a discontinued operation. So assuming the completion of the Upjohn transaction before December 31, the financial guidance we are providing will not be aligned with the ultimate numbers we print for the year. I'll start by saying, there were no changes made to either the new Pfizer or Upjohn 2020 guidance factors and only slight refinements to total company guidance. For total company, we are tightening our guidance range for revenues, which results in a small decrease in our midpoint and this is mainly a factor of reducing the top end of the range, as opposed to a change in our forecast. Costs as a percentage of revenue is slightly increased, mainly due to COVID-related costs, while the SI&A range is lowered a bit at the midpoint, mainly COVID, and enabling function-driven and R&D increases slightly mainly due to additional COVID program spending. This nets out to a slight increase in the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS range. Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer and Upjohn which is shown here. As I referenced, we are not making any changes to either new Pfizer or to Upjohn. Moving on to key takeaways, in the third quarter, our company performed well, driven by strong revenue growth, from our biopharma business. We narrowed ranges for our 2020 total company guidance for revenues, cost of sales, SI&A, R&D, and adjusted diluted EPS. And we reaffirmed our existing guidance components for both, new Pfizer and Upjohn. We also achieved multiple product and pipeline milestones, since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here. A more complete listing can be found in this morning's press release. Finally, we paid $6.3 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of this year. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns, in 2020, and beyond. Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck.\nChuck Triano: Great. Thank you, Frank and Albert for the prepared remarks. So time now to start our Q&A session. And operator, can I ask you to please poll for the questions?\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I know there's a ton of questions that everyone has but, let me just ask one Albert for all the generalist investors listening in, which I think all the specialists understand. But can you just remind everyone that -- how a blinded trial works and whether -- and how you guys don't have, I think visibility on where the trial is tracking, for the generalists? But let me get to my question now. In your trial, the definition of a positive COVID revolves around one general symptom and one positive PCR. However the general symptoms could be very broad. So I guess, my question is the fact that, there wasn't any sterilizing immunity in the nonhuman primates. Isn't it reasonable to assume that, we could see some positive PCRs on vaccine, even though there's a good amount of neutralizing titers? And if you could remind us what's the cycle threshold for PCR, you're using. Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Umer. And I will ask Mikael to comment on that, just a couple of words before. A study usually -- a pivotal study needs to be blinded, so nobody knows if has received the vaccine or the placebo. That includes the doctor or the nurse, that administer the vaccine, or the patient who is receiving it. And of course all are going to the database and that is locked, with a code so no one can have access, from the Pfizer except a very small team that it is protected with Chinese walls. And of course, the DMC is going to -- is receiving periodically information un-blinded. But not, -- they didn't start yet. So the data monitor committee is -- it's composed by independent experts. But they haven't seen any unblinded data yet. And they haven't performed any analysis -- interim analysis yet. And with that, I will ask Mikael, to speak a little bit about, the specific technical question.\nMikael Dolsten: Yeah. Thank you for the question. So Umer, we have as you know two primary endpoints. The first relates to, impact of naive patients to the first infection. And the second one relates to the same, but also adding, re-infection in those that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. We use PCR machines on a commercial platform that, we have thoroughly validated. And feel very comfortable with. And use established criteria for positive cases. The central read in our large laboratory is the crucial one here. We are also able at the end of the study to look at patients that did not develop symptoms, since as you said we are particularly focused on illness cases. So we use a serology test for the nucleocapsid protein that, allow us also to look at impact at the end of the trial for patients that were asymptomatic. The symptom in the scale that we use was established in consultation with many KOL and FDA. But we also have secondary endpoint that uses CDC's symptom scale. So I think, hopefully that covered many aspects of your questions.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. So we move to our next question, please operator?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Mizuho.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, maybe one in Eliquis and then one back on the COVID-19 vaccine. So on Eliquis, I saw the commentary around the, net price being lower. It covers gap and also the channel mix. I'm wondering if you can maybe just sort of quantify that a little bit more for us. And maybe any sort of sense of how we should think about the pricing dynamics of that product going forward just since it's obviously an important product, for you guys. And then on the COVID-19 vaccine Albert, appreciate your comments, the other day around communicating, when you have specific information. I think one thing that's just sort of been a little bit confusing, a bit more and maybe you're trying to address that now is the sort of either you'll have conclusive results on an interim analysis. And so maybe can you just sort of talk to that. Or maybe Mikael can comment on some of the confidence you have that an interim analysis in this trial should be sufficient to show conclusive efficacy as opposed to waiting, for the final results. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you. I will ask Angela to speak about the Eliquis. Let me take first a little bit this COVID-19. Look, we are cautiously optimistic that we will have results and possibly an interim analysis. We never \u2013 you never know before you have the final analysis. This cautious optimism is coming from the very strong immunogenicity data that we have very strong neutralizing titers and a very strong T-cell response, excluding CD8, which is one of the important. But as I said, you never know until you have a study readout. And we have reached the last mile here right, so we expect that these things will start coming soon. So let's all have the patience that's required for something so important for public health and global economy. And with that, I will ask Angela to comment on Eliquis.\nAngela Hwang: So thanks for the question. So this gross-to-net adjustment is clearly a key feature of Eliquis because of the large number of Medicare patients that we have. And every year not only are there a different number or an increasing number of Medicare patients but also there are changes in the coverage gap. And as we mentioned, the key change this time is the length of time that patients are in this catastrophic coverage gap, which is longer in Q3 of 2020, compared to Q3 of 2019 by about 25% and this is sort of the level of impact that we saw this year. And so obviously this increases our expense and is the reason for the unfavorable impact. But hopefully, that gives you some sense of what happened between Q3 of this year and Q3 of last year. Thank you.\nChuck Triano: Thanks, Angela and Albert. Operator, let\u2019s move to the next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Truist.\nGregg Gilbert: Hi, thanks for the question. First, Albert you noted that there's still that gap on abrocitinib versus Street estimates and what the company sees. I was hoping you could provide a little more detail behind your bullish view beyond what you offered on the call about it not being a zero-sum game. And the second part of my question is Albert, you've expressed a lot of confidence in Pfizer's ability to hit that revenue CAGR and you did so again today without COVID and without deals. But how focused are you and the team on bringing in assets to buttress that growth and/or add growth drivers that come later in the decade? Thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. I will answer the second part and then I will ask Angela actually to walk us through the abrocitinib projections that we are having. We are very confident on the 6% CAGR. And I think we have broken it down to what we believe will take to reach there. Right now if you take the middle point of our guidance with $41.6 billion, we will need additional $14 billion by 2025 to achieve 6% growth. We believe $8 billion are projected to come from our in-line portfolio and we put that during our earnings release. So that means that we are having a $6 billion that need to come from our current pipeline. Based on our projections on the revenue this requires only 40% adjustment. So $6 billion of the $15 billion that we are expecting to have non-risk adjusted in that year is a very good safety margin. That being said, also we generate a lot of cash and we want to invest this cash. And right now our business development strategy, it is to invest in something that we believe can generate significant value for the shareholders and this is to our R&D machine, an R&D machine that has completely turned around its productivity and right now is having industry-leading metrics in the multiple fronts. So our business development will be invested in Phase II \u2013 Phase III-ready programs that could become medicines in the period of 2023, 2024, 2025 2026. And those from one hand can enhance the 6% growth but even more importantly, will allow us to maintain and sustain this growth beyond 2026. So with that clarification and thank you very much Gregg for the question, I would like to ask Angela to speak a little bit about abrocitinib.\nAngela Hwang: Thank you, Albert, and thanks for the question and giving us the opportunity to follow up since our discussion during R&D Day. We are really excited about this opportunity and we're enthusiastic about it, because it is a condition that has a large number of patients, a significant unmet need. And both of these things is what we believe drives the size of opportunity for abro. So let me unpack that a little bit. First of all there are significant number of AD sufferers. Globally, there are 60 million AD sufferers, age 12 and up and 27 million of those are in the U.S. And just for a bit of context that is 10 times the number of RA sufferers today. Of those 60 million, only 7% of them today are being treated with a systemic agent. And so the systemic market opportunity has the real potential to more than double with the introduction of better systemic treatment because the patient need is just so high. And let me just also put that in context with a market that we know very well today, which is psoriasis. The market for systemic in psoriasis doubled over the last 10 years with the introduction of advanced systemic biologics and also more recently the IL inhibitors. So if we step back and take a look at those numbers, even at a modest 1% share of the 60 million patient population, or if you think about the future systemic market, all I need is 8% of that systemic market for abro to reach a $3 billion revenue at peak. And so, when you think about all of that and think about the advanced systemic markets that are also in place today of which there is just one and 60% of those patients who are on this product are not reaching clear or almost clear skin at 16 weeks, it demonstrates that there really is a lot of room for additional systemic options. So to Albert's point earlier about the fact that this is not a zero-sum game, we don't see the opportunity for abro as only being about gaining market share from competitors. Actually, the way we see it, is that it is an opportunity to grow the advanced systemic market through the introduction of excellent treatment options. And we believe that the differentiated profile that abro has will allow us to be a leader in this growing market. And also, don't forget market development and creating new markets is a real sweet spot for Pfizer. So, we are very excited about the launch and look forward to bringing this important medicine to the market. Thank you.\nChuck Triano: Thanks, Angela. And Greg, yes just one comment on your second question about the deals. A reminder that Valneva in the Lyme disease vaccine area is going well. Arixa, a deal we just announced in the antibiotic segment. So clearly, Pfizer is still going to remain active in bringing in assets that can help bolster the long-term revenue growth of the company there. With that, let\u2019s take our next question please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and thanks again for all the work on the COVID treatment and vaccine front. I guess, I know you can't provide a lot of commentary, but I think what people are trying to understand is just, if there have been any changes to the mandate of the DMC with respect to some of the new FDA guidance, so regarding the timing of the interim efficacy analysis. So essentially, is the DMC mandated now to wait for either a certain number of severe cases that have to happen or two months of safety follow-up data to kind of at that point take a look at the efficacy basis because I think you guys have been pretty confident about reporting data in October -- by the end of October. And so, just trying to understand kind of the timing of the analysis and maybe any new inputs there. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Terence and I understand how the whole world is looking for any possible information. And we try to make sure that we maintain a very responsible way of from one hand being transparent and from the other hand not feeding speculations. So, what I can tell you to your very specific question is, until now, as we are speaking of today, no DMC has not been changed their mandates. There have not been any changes like that. And I can still repeat that we haven't performed any interim analysis yet and that we believe that the analysis will start soon on efficacy. And if the efficacy is positive or if the efficacy is negative, we will announce it. And that will happen a few days after the DMC announce that to us, which usually takes five, six, seven days. And that if it happens before the third week of November, which is very likely because, as I said, we are expecting it soon, a few days before the end of October, a few days after the end of October, but if it happens before the 15th of November, we will announce it before the 15th of November. As I said, right now, no analysis has been performed. DMC is completely blinded in any data. Of course, we are completely blinded in any data. And once we have the conditions met, they will unblind their data and they will start informing us. So, let's all be very patient. I know how much the stress levels are growing. I know how much a vaccine is needed for the world. We are seeing right now the worst fears that we've had before during -- before are becoming true. The COVID is coming back in Europe and the U.S. and globally and we are working very diligently, very carefully to make sure that we will bring this project through the finish line. Thank you.\nChuck Triano: Great. Thanks, Albert, very helpful. Next question please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. Albert, I'm sorry to keep pushing on this COVID readout, but you seem very bullish that you will have a positive efficacy readout, I think you've said by the end of October and that you will disclose it. Now, it's clear, it will be within five to seven days after that. So that suggests that you believe that you'll -- I think the hurdle for the first interim is something in the range of 75% to 80% efficacy. So is that your expectation? And then secondly could you comment on the realistic timing for the first dosing given that the FDA has said they need to convene an AdCom presumably you also need to have an ACIP recommendation, then you need to distribute the vaccine. Can you comment on whether it's realistic in your planning right now that anyone will be vaccinated outside the clinical trial by year-end? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Geoff. And no apologies are needed to be asked. I understand that this is very important for the whole world issue. Let me clarify, I'm not bullish that the vaccine will work. I'm cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work. What I said very clearly it is that we may know by the end of October, if it works or not. And I think -- I reiterate this statement today. It could be -- as I said the October is not for us -- I know it's compared with the elections time. But for us the elections is an artificial milestone. This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democratic vaccine. That will be the vaccine for the citizens of the world and this is how we see it. So I hope that it is going to be effective. I hope that it is going to be effective with very high protection ability but we have to wait to see the results of the study. Now when it comes to distribution, assuming we have positive data assuming that means that we will be ready to apply in the U.S. for emergency use authorization soon after we received the safety data so the safety data are expected to mature in the third week of November. So let's say, we apply around that time third fourth week of November then it is up to FDA to take as much time as they need to make the approval. It's not up to us so I cannot comment on that. What I know it is -- but we will be ready with product available. Again if all goes well but we are very well undergoing through our plans. We will be ready to distribute an initial number of those. And I believe that in the U.S. that you are asking, we have a contract with the U.S. government that we should provide them 100 million doses by March and we are feeling very good about our ability to do it. But also there's a provision that we should provide 40 million of this million doses in this year. So I think we should be able -- 30 million to 40 million to be able to provide, if we receive approval and if the U.S. government distributes their vaccines. Just to put things into perspective, let's say, 30 million doses it's 15 million people. So if we make available in the U.S. the vaccine that will be for 15 million people by the end of the year which is a very small part of the population. So it's not going to be massively available. It's going to be targeted in its availability. As we move into the first months of 2021 then we are going to have much more massive distribution of the vaccine around the world. So I hope that helps, put things into perspective. Again thank you for the interest. We all keep our fingers crossed that science will win. \nChuck Triano: Thanks Albert. Next question please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. \nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. First question I had was is there any way to help us think through if you've reached these 32 events yet? I know there's a lot of investor interest here so just trying to get as much color as we can? And then can you provide an update on how many actual doses of vaccine you've already manufactured? It sounds like you're obviously very positive on your goals here. And the last question is will you continue to look at potential adjuvant opportunities for IBRANCE? Or are you really just going to focus on next-generation CDKs? \nAlbert Bourla: Again let me take this question. So far we have produced hundreds of thousands of those and we are moving very rapidly with both sites to start initiating a much larger production. When it comes to thinking through, I don't think I can help you think more than what we have said so far. We are blinded events will accumulate. We will unblind the data. DMC will tell us negative positive or continue. If it is negative or positive we will let you know. If it is -- and then if it is continue, we will continue until the next milestone is reached. There's nothing else to think. But as I said, we will start this process very soon. Now for IBRANCE I'll ask Angela to comment. \nAngela Hwang: So yes thanks for the question on IBRANCE. In terms of our focus for IBRANCE where we've been as you know is really looking at the early breast cancer indications which disappointingly did not pan out for us in PALLAS and PENELOPE so we are very much focused on metastatic breast cancer as our opportunity with IBRANCE.  And here we continue to feel really confident about what we've seen with our data as well as what we're seeing from a market share perspective right? So first-line use of CDK in metastatic breast cancer as a class, it's still only at 52%, but we have a long way to go in terms of our ability to grow this class. But actually, for IBRANCE itself, it has a very high market share 87% in fact. And we've had this leadership position in first-line treatment for many years. And in fact, since May even post the announcement of the monarchE data, we have seen this consistent market share. So I think that our focus on metastatic breast cancer and our focus on growing the use of the CDK class in metastatic cancer will continue to provide us a tremendous amount of opportunity. I think just as a follow-up to your question in terms of are there other ideas and other thoughts for IBRANCE, just to remind you that we do have still the PATINA trial that is ongoing, which will read out in the second half of 2022 for a different population HR-positive and HER2-positive population. So it's a slightly different question, but really touches on additional expansion opportunities for IBRANCE. Thank you.\nChuck Triano: Great. Thanks, Angela. Thanks for the question, Louise. Let's take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob: Thanks so much for taking my question. And I will be very in line with my colleagues about questioning questions on the COVID vaccines. Maybe let me try this a different way. Versus your original assumptions, when you were designing the trial and based on the literature and the data set \u2013 data that are out there, not necessarily in the trial, but just from what you're seeing outside of the trial, how do you think the symptomatically for folks that are infected compared to when you originally designed the study? That's question number one. And similarly, I suppose also, with infection rate itself, I think when you enhance the size of the study from 30,000 to 44,000 patients, one of the reasons \u2013 rationale for increasing the size is because of what you deemed to be a slower infection rate. I'm wondering about that, as well as the symptom rate relative to the original assumptions? Thank you so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Yeah. Thank you, Navin, and again I understand the interest here. I don't want to comment much more. But what we see is our infection rates that they're aligned with what we see in the country. That's not something to be a surprise, because it's a large study that we try to position geographically in multiple sites that represent basically the country in the U.S. where we have the bulk of the patients. The increase of 30,000 to 44,000 anyway wouldn't make any difference in the early readouts. It would only make a difference because of the larger numbers at the very, very late readouts. So I don't think that was the reason, but we did it. It was mainly, because we felt very good about the safety profile, so we started \u2013 we opened our vaccination to kids of 16 years old in beginning then we went to 12 years old, and then we went to people that they are suffering from HIV, from hepatitis B, from hepatitis C. So this is why. And also we use it to improve the diversity of the study which we have made it public so it's very, very good right now. I feel very good about the diversity of our study. So Navin thanks for your question. Let's all keep our fingers crossed, but we will have positive readouts.\nChuck Triano: Great. Let's move to the next question, please operator.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I guess, my first was on abrocitinib and market development. Thank you for the earlier comment. I guess, my question is if I look at the RA situation it took some time for the JAKs to gain traction. Obviously, now the class is doing really well. Do you expect a similar situation in AD? So, launch that eventually gets very large, but maybe takes some time to build momentum? Or are there differences in this market that could allow for faster uptake here? And then my second question was on VYNDAQEL, and how we think about growth from here? Should we think about the ratio of diagnosed patients to those who receive drug to shrink significantly over time? Or should we think about there being a persistent gap between diagnosis rates and those who actually receive the product? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yeah. Excellent questions, both I think are appropriate to be answered by Angela. So Angela, why don't we start with abrocitinib and how you think the market will evolve given the experience on RA and JAKs? And then of course in VYNDAQEL what \u2013 how that change between diagnosis and treatment can evolve over time?\nAngela Hwang: Great. Thank you. I think in all the I&I areas, what we're dealing with here are very complex diseases, chronic diseases, where there is a tremendous amount of debilitation for our patients and a lot of suffering. So I think first and foremost, I think both RA and atopic derm share that. But maybe the difference that I see the greatest between the two is that RA is a pretty well-established disease for whom \u2013 even at the time when we launched Xeljanz right there was a lot of treatment, there was a lot of biologics, there was not an oral, but there was a lot of biologics. That in fact is quite different, when we think about where we are with atopic derm in that \u2013 in the atopic derm today, there are just not great treatments. We talked earlier today about -- in the opening about the systemic treatment, right? There's a lot of use of steroids. There is a Dupixent that has been a great solution for many patients. But even with all of that there's just not a lot of solutions at all. And today there is still a high -- there is really a significant unmet need in terms of what patients are being able to do. So I think with all market development with all new treatments, it takes time for you to reach peak. But we believe that given the significant unmet need and in particular for atopic derm patients where I think typically we've been focused on skin clearing, but what we also know for patients is that the number one condition they're suffering from is providers. And that when you have agents that can really resolve that and resolve that very quickly, it will open up opportunities that didn't previously exist before in AD. So that's how I see the market. I think we're really excited about it. We see a great ability to really meet patient unmet needs and that is going to drive our growth. Your second question was around Vyndaqel and how to think about diagnosis versus the people that receive the drug. And I think on this regard what you should expect to see is there will be some gap right? So between those who are diagnosed, there is always a difference between those that are diagnosed and those who are deemed eligible to receive treatment. And then there is a difference between -- or a gap then the next step that you have to take is for those that are treated how many of them actually get the prescription and receive a prescription. And I think that actually on that front we've been doing rather well. This quarter in Q3, 82% of those who were deemed treatment eligible were able to receive a Vyndaqel prescription. And that is in fact up from last quarter where it was actually 78% of those who were deemed eligible for treatment received a script. So the gap is not all that wide and we've seen improvements from last quarter to this one. So I think along the entire patient funnel for Vyndaqel we have great opportunities to improve how the patient flows on diagnosis to treatment, treatment to receiving a script, receiving a script to actually getting the medicines in the hands through specialty pharmacy. It's still a new condition and one that's early in its launch, so I think that we have great opportunities to improve every step of the way. Thank you.\nChuck Triano: Great. Thanks for the comments, Angela Hwang. Next question please operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. Albert with all due respect, could you please be absolutely clear whether the 32 events have been reached already? It seems that the answer is, yes, Pfizer has the 32 events otherwise I think you would say no. And on to the DMD gene therapy, will Phase 3 start this year? And has Pfizer and FDA agreed on a potency assay? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Steve, I appreciate the curiosity and I appreciate the creativity and everybody can try every possible angle, but I think I have answered this as fully as we are prepared. Now you used a very creative way of asking, so I will tell you clearly, no, we don't have the 32 events right now. So that's what I can say. So -- and I have to say, I backtracked can you remind me what was the second part of the question?\nChuck Triano: Yes question was in DMD has the FDA agreed on a potency assay?\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael, maybe you can take that?\nMikael Dolsten: Absolutely. I think Steve you first asked will Phase 3 start this year. We expect and I believe Phase 3 will start this year and relatively soon. As you know the profile through modification of the steroid dose from one mg per kg to two mg per kg looks really great now. And Albert spoke in his introduction to the 19 treated boys, in which in the recent, after the steroid change we have had no cases with complement activation so we're very excited about the current plan. Now for the assay, yes, as part of our final protocol development with FDA, we changed from an initial inverted terminal repeat methodology to a transient method as suggested by FDA along with the weight of the patients to determine those. And that's all in place and made the initial dose of what was expressed as 3E14 go down to the 2E14. It's the very same dose that we use all the time. It's just that the different assay gives a different readout. But all of that is in place. We have a terrific technology platform that I think is the leading in this field how to measure the various endpoints including the concentration of the virus gene therapy.\nChuck Triano: Great. Thanks, Mikael. Thanks for the question Steve. Let\u2019s move to our next question please operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. \nTim Anderson: Thank you. I have a non-COVID question, which is following the initial news where, you said, you spin at Upjohn, you described the company is likely to pay less of its free cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. And I'm wondering, if that's still the current view, especially, if you can achieve the revenue growth targets you've given of at least 6% over the next several years. And that question ties into another question on M&A. What's the upper limit on the size of the deals you might be considering? Should we assume these will likely be sub-$10 billion transactions? Or are larger deals also potentially on the table? \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Tim for asking a non-COVID question. Appreciate it really. And also it came at the time that I thought Frank will not have a chance to speak, but now we are giving him the exact right forum. So Frank, take it from here. \nFrank D'Amelio: Thank you, Albert. And Tim thanks for the question. So on M&A, we always say we never say never because one of the nice things about being part of Pfizer is we have the firepower to pretty much do any kind of a deal we want and I think we've been able to demonstrate that in the past. So I wouldn't limit us or cap us on some specific dollar amount given the firepower that we have. Albert mentioned earlier, our focus has been mid-phase, Phase II, Phase III kind of things that would impact our revenue base 2024, 2025, 2026. But in terms of capacity quite frankly, we're very much unlimited, strong balance street, strong capital structure, strong investment grade. We generate lots of operating cash flow. So we're in a very good position quite frankly to be very proactive as we need to be on M&A. And then in terms of your Upjohn question. From my perspective, we get the Upjohn deal done. We form Viatris. We're going to get $12 billion in cash. Our intent with that $12 billion in cash is to pay down debt given we're transferring give or take about $4 billion of EBITDA to Upjohn. But our capital deployment priorities don't change as a result of that transaction. We'll still return capital to our shareholders as we have been doing. We'll continue to invest in the business and our pipeline obviously and capital and then we'll continue to invest in M&A. So from my perspective capital priorities don't change. And in terms of M&A capacity, we're fortunate enough where we really have lots of capacity and lots of firepower. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Tim. And we move to our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. \nRandall Stanicky: Great. Thanks. Albert, you guys -- can you talk about the post EUA or post-approval plan around communicating safety data to the public on the -- your vaccine just to get people more comfortable? Because one of the concerns is going to be the percent of people willing to take a vaccine earlier maybe lower than it had been in previous months. And obviously, those numbers should be higher to get the herd immunity? And then a second question for Frank. Going back to the enabling-function costs you guys called out in January $4.5 billion there. Maybe just help frame that for us. How much of those savings have you already realized? How quickly can you realize additional savings in 2021? Just trying to understand the margin opportunity there. Thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Let me take the first before I pass it to Frank. And actually I will ask the help of Angela here also in answering this question. I do see because we are launching the polls and also I speak to people, my neighbors, my friends and I do see that there is some skepticism that has been mainly because of the politicization of the vaccine. So this is real and I think we need to address it. But we started addressing it long time back. We are doing for this disease -- for this vaccine things that we have never done before. And those are first of all things that have to do with transparency. We have published our protocol. We have -- we are publishing real-time our Phase I data to our community and the public, but also the other scientists and the other companies that are developing COVID vaccines can see them and learn from them. We have announced the first results of our pivotal study unblinded data, of course, on the safety. We signed a pledge, but make very clear to the world that we are going to follow the high ethical and quality standards. And we will continue being very transparent and very quality science-driven, which I think it is the best way to overcome the public's opinion. So by the way, we didn't even take money from the government. So to make sure that Pfizer will stay out of the politics. And this vaccine at our risk -- financial risk would not be characterized as the Republican vaccine or the Democratic vaccine. It's not -- it is a vaccine for the world that we are developing. Now going forward, I think, we will do also -- will continue doing things. Our safety data according to the FDA will be reviewed publicly by an advisory committee so that will be another additional good step. As for transparency, Angela you want also to add a few things that we are planning to do? \nAngela Hwang: Sure. Well, over and above what Albert said, obviously, having clear public education and a well-supported public education effort is going to be critical, right? We need to educate the public on the importance of actually getting the vaccine and then of course, around the safety processes and creating confidence around the development process that has gone into developing these vaccines. And so this happens sort of at two levels: first is about how Pfizer is working through intermediaries and opinion leaders to provide this education; and then secondly what we can do ourselves.  So on the first front, we have already been and are continuing our efforts to work with industry partners, patient organizations, government and other public health institutions to share with them our expertise, so that they can create and build content and also deliver education as they need. So just as I said, this is well underway. There's a multichannel approach. That includes ETC and these experts are already deploying a wide range of channels and forms of communication to educate and to educate specific communities.  On the other hand for us, once we have authorization and once we have a label, we'll be able to do additional communication and more education around our vaccine specifically. We also recognize that of course, there are certain communities that have been minority communities specifically that have been more affected by this disease than others, so we're also supporting the development of specific content and education that can more effectively reach these communities and be more customized with sort of the approach and the content that we are sharing. So this is a very big effort that is already underway and I think you're going to see more and more of this build-up towards the end of the year. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. And before I ask Frank to take the question about cost of enabling functions, I would like also Mikael to comment about our pharmacovigilance program that we have put in place and how that also could play a significant role in ensuring about the vaccine's safety. Mikael? \nMikael Dolsten : Thank you, Albert. So we have the pharmacovigilance platform in the industry that has experience to handle the largest number of the adverse event reporting by far. And we have started very proactively and been in open dialogue with the operation with speed and FDA about putting this pharmacovigilance platform to play, to monitor sophisticated participant whether viewing a potential EUA and later approval. And that includes building control cohorts already now for understanding continuous disease reporting of what we expect to be the first group of responders such as health care workers and first-line responders.  We also recognize the big need for many stakeholders from pharmacists, nurses, patients, physicians to have access to rapid information. We have a very strong medical information platform across the globe and we have now augmented it both with staff and with self-serving Webex platform to be able to respond to many aspects of how we store, distribute the vaccine and expected so far mild to moderate tolerability et cetera seen with this vaccine and similar vaccines. So I think we feel we are very well prepared for that. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla : Thank you, Mikael. Now Frank, back to you. \nFrank D'Amelio: Yes. And Randall the way I'll do this let me run some numbers and provide some I'll call it financial context. And then I'll drill down and I'll answer your question. So just first on SI&A because you're talking about the enabling function so on SI&A for the quarter we were $2.87 billion. We were down 10% year-over-year. It was really driven by three things: on the consumer separations, which was give or take about half the reduction; reduced spending in enabling functions; and some of it was COVID-driven. I called that out because a piece of that is enabling functions, which was probably what triggered the question.  Now let me run the overall numbers and then I'll drill down and answer the question. So our previous guidance on SI&A for the year was $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. We tightened the range to $11.5 billion to $12 billion and that was really driven by COVID savings because obviously we knew about consumer, we had enabling function spending already in our plan. So it was really driven primarily by COVID spending. Then of that $11.5 billion to $12 billion, I think $4 billion to $4.5 billion is the enabling functions, which is now getting to your question.  The way I think about this is you look at that $4 billion to $4.5 billion as an either/or an expense-to-revenue ratio of the total company as it exists today and the new company when we're a smaller company because of the revenues that move to Viatris. We want that expense-to-revenue ratio to be the same or less than what it currently is today. So that's kind of a simple way to think about how we're thinking about this and how we are planning in terms of what to do with our enabling functions.  Then the question you asked was Frank, you asked me a pacing question. In terms of 2021, '22, we'll obviously go as fast as we can and get as much of it as we can into 2021. Obviously, some of it will fall into 2022 just because of the nature of some of the places where we do business and certain things taking more time than others. And I'll provide more clarity on this when we provide our 2021 guidance including the SI&A guidance on our next earnings call. \nRandall Stanicky: Thank you, Frank.\nChuck Triano : Sure. Get another question here please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Scott on for Geoff. Thanks for taking my question. You disclosed last quarter that the FDA indicated an AdCom meeting was not anticipated for tanezumab. But it seems like they want one now in March 2021, so that will push out the December PDUFA. So what changed? And maybe you can give us some more insight into your discussions with the FDA. And then, maybe as a follow-up, the assay itself wasn't highlighted as an assay with peak sales was from Investor Day. So what do you expect kind of internally peak sales upside to be here if you receive approval? Thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Angela, why don't you take those two? And then also, maybe Mikael can comment later on the discussion with FDA, but you first Angela.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. So, we are -- the tanezumab trial represents probably one of the biggest submissions that Pfizer has ever provided the FDA. Our data are extensive, and there's a lot to understand. So we're not surprised by the request to have an AdCom. And in fact we're looking forward to having this opportunity to really review and to discuss what we have seen in our data and in our clinical trials and to discuss this opportunity with the advisory committee. So, we see that as something that will create a good discussion. In terms of the way to look at the opportunity this is how we see it. This is really like many conditions, but this one in particular, a significant unmet need in the treatment of osteoarthritis. There are about 27 million Americans that suffer from this, 11 million of whom have moderate to severe OA. And in the U.S. 80% of those, moderate to severe OA patients, have already trialed and tried and failed three or more analgesics. So we know that these patients are unable today to achieve adequate pain relief. And so while there are options out there, what we also know is that the options are inadequate. And so when you look at the patient population that's ahead of us, the opportunity to provide a novel and a non-opioid form of pain relief, we think that this is the kind of opportunity that I think patients will be very interested in.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. Mikael, anything to add about tanezumab filing, and FDA's request for advisory committee?\nMikael Dolsten: I thought Angela answered great. Maybe I can add two things. As a potential first-in-class treatment, it's not uncommon for the FDA to hold an AdCom to discuss the submission. So in a way, it was expected. And of course, the discussion will be focused on those many patients that are not well controlled or unresponsive, not eligible who do not want to take any of the existing pain medication, and as an alternative to longer use of opioids, that's where the discussion will be. And as Angela said, we always welcome AdComs in order to share our experience and get external perspective.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Chuck, back to you.\nChuck Triano: Thanks for the insight folks. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So, I have one question for Albert and one for Frank. Albert thanks for the update today. Could you please define what you mean when you say you will disclose results when there is a conclusive readout? Does that mean interim efficacy success on the primary endpoint? Or does your definition of a conclusive readout include more than just the primary endpoint? And for Frank, regarding enabling functions, you've been talking about that for a couple of years, and my understanding is that, you've already been driving efficiencies in the corporate cost structure of Pfizer. So, could you just update us on where the run rate stands today versus the $4 billion to $4.5 billion you were discussing a couple of years ago? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, David. My definition of conclusive result positive or negative, it is a futility or a demonstrated efficacy, readout in the primary endpoint. That's how things work. So, Frank? \nFrank D'Amelio: Yeah. Thanks Albert. So Dave, we have been reducing the enabling functions over the years, and that's obviously been reflected in the guidance that we've provided over the last year or two. That $4 billion to $4.5 billion should be thought of as a base for 2025. And obviously, we'll go to work on that base and we are going to work on that base as we move into 2021 and 2022. And the intent is obviously to generate -- to capture as much of those savings as we can, as quickly as we can. But the $4 billion to $4.5 billion think about that as the base that we'll come off of.\nAlbert Bourla: All right. Thanks, Frank. And operator, can we take our last question for the call please. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A couple of questions. Firstly, out-of-pocket caps seem to have been proposed twice once by the Senate and then more recently by the President prior to the most favored nation executive Order. Thinking about VYNDAQEL and other high-priced small molecules obviously this could be very helpful to your business, if this comes to pass. Do you think there's a high probability that regardless of which administration out-of-pocket caps for Medicare patients is likely to feature as a central part of health care reform? And then second, just to clarify on COVID, the interim analysis. We're receiving questions from our clients repeatedly about the level of disclosure. Will it be a simple we met we look forward to sharing the data? Or do you actually disclose the data at the time the efficacy readout is given?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Andrew. Now about the out-of-pocket costs. Pfizer repeatedly and the industry as a whole has pointed out that right now the way that the insurance benefits are working is not sustainable anymore. Right now, the Americans pay out-of-pocket for their medicines likely they do not have insurance, although they do have and they took a very expensive likely very good assuming they didn't have to pay from their own pocket. So this is something that needs to change. And it seems like there is a general recognition both -- in both sides of the aisle. We will continue working with all and we hope that we will see a change in the design of these benefits that will reduce the cost that the Americans have to pay out-of-pocket when they go to collect their medicines. This is not something that needs to be done because it will help the financial bottom lines of the industry. This is because it needs to help the patients and the health care system cost in general. Right now the fact that some patients don't have the out-of-pocket to take their medicine as a result that we have significant numbers that they do not take their medicines, but medicines that are needed, medicines that have been prescribed by the physician. And as a result patients are ending up in the health care system in hospitals and they cause the health care system much more. So there is a need, any way you see it cost-wise or human paying-wise this needs to be reformed. Now in terms of COVID-19 and I think that was the last question that we have today. So it looks like it's going to be a COVID-19 in the last question. I think right now we are planning to as always these things to have a press release that we'll speak about top line met the endpoint or not. And then of course, we plan to publish data in a peer review magazine so that they will be all available. But keep in mind that once we submit data, if things goes according to plan by the third, fourth week of November there'll be also -- I think they plan to make them public during the AdCom, advisory committee that they will have. So I think that concludes our call, Chuck isn't it? \nChuck Triano: That's correct. Albert back to you for closing remarks. \nAlbert Bourla: Yes. So I just want to thank all of you for joining us today, of course your continued engagement with Pfizer. As you just heard, our continued strong performance speaks to the resiliency of our business and the strength of our portfolio, the ingenuity and the resolve of our people and I think the power of our products. As we indicated during our Investor Day, we are very confident in our pipeline. We like its breadth, we like its depth and we will continue to be opportunistic about bringing in additional promising assets where appropriate. Now we need to continue to execute and deliver for patients. Of course, we continue to monitor global economies related to COVID impact. COVID is affecting not only our business  to quantify the opportunity today to us. But if we try to quantify the opportunity what it's doing to the global economy, we are speaking about 3 years. And now it has become more obvious than any time that many things need to be done to control this pandemic. Vaccines are expected if successful to play a key role to become a very important tool. We are working very diligently. I understand and appreciate your interest that became very obvious. I just ask everybody to be a little bit patient. So -- and we all cross our fingers that science would win. Thank you very much everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "So thanks for the question. So this gross-to-net adjustment is clearly a key feature of Eliquis because of the large number of Medicare patients that we have. And every year not only are there a different number or an increasing number of Medicare patients but also there are changes in the coverage gap. And as we mentioned, the key change this time is the length of time that patients are in this catastrophic coverage gap, which is longer in Q3 of 2020, compared to Q3 of 2019 by about 25% and this is sort of the level of impact that we saw this year. And so obviously this increases our expense and is the reason for the unfavorable impact. But hopefully, that gives you some sense of what happened between Q3 of this year and Q3 of last year. Thank you. Thank you, Albert, and thanks for the question and giving us the opportunity to follow up since our discussion during R&D Day. We are really excited about this opportunity and we're enthusiastic about it, because it is a condition that has a large number of patients, a significant unmet need. And both of these things is what we believe drives the size of opportunity for abro. So let me unpack that a little bit. First of all there are significant number of AD sufferers. Globally, there are 60 million AD sufferers, age 12 and up and 27 million of those are in the U.S. And just for a bit of context that is 10 times the number of RA sufferers today. Of those 60 million, only 7% of them today are being treated with a systemic agent. And so the systemic market opportunity has the real potential to more than double with the introduction of better systemic treatment because the patient need is just so high. And let me just also put that in context with a market that we know very well today, which is psoriasis. The market for systemic in psoriasis doubled over the last 10 years with the introduction of advanced systemic biologics and also more recently the IL inhibitors. So if we step back and take a look at those numbers, even at a modest 1% share of the 60 million patient population, or if you think about the future systemic market, all I need is 8% of that systemic market for abro to reach a $3 billion revenue at peak. And so, when you think about all of that and think about the advanced systemic markets that are also in place today of which there is just one and 60% of those patients who are on this product are not reaching clear or almost clear skin at 16 weeks, it demonstrates that there really is a lot of room for additional systemic options. So to Albert's point earlier about the fact that this is not a zero-sum game, we don't see the opportunity for abro as only being about gaining market share from competitors. Actually, the way we see it, is that it is an opportunity to grow the advanced systemic market through the introduction of excellent treatment options. And we believe that the differentiated profile that abro has will allow us to be a leader in this growing market. And also, don't forget market development and creating new markets is a real sweet spot for Pfizer. So, we are very excited about the launch and look forward to bringing this important medicine to the market. Thank you. So yes thanks for the question on IBRANCE. In terms of our focus for IBRANCE where we've been as you know is really looking at the early breast cancer indications which disappointingly did not pan out for us in PALLAS and PENELOPE so we are very much focused on metastatic breast cancer as our opportunity with IBRANCE.  And here we continue to feel really confident about what we've seen with our data as well as what we're seeing from a market share perspective right? So first-line use of CDK in metastatic breast cancer as a class, it's still only at 52%, but we have a long way to go in terms of our ability to grow this class. But actually, for IBRANCE itself, it has a very high market share 87% in fact. And we've had this leadership position in first-line treatment for many years. And in fact, since May even post the announcement of the monarchE data, we have seen this consistent market share. So I think that our focus on metastatic breast cancer and our focus on growing the use of the CDK class in metastatic cancer will continue to provide us a tremendous amount of opportunity. I think just as a follow-up to your question in terms of are there other ideas and other thoughts for IBRANCE, just to remind you that we do have still the PATINA trial that is ongoing, which will read out in the second half of 2022 for a different population HR-positive and HER2-positive population. So it's a slightly different question, but really touches on additional expansion opportunities for IBRANCE. Thank you. Great. Thank you. I think in all the I&I areas, what we're dealing with here are very complex diseases, chronic diseases, where there is a tremendous amount of debilitation for our patients and a lot of suffering. So I think first and foremost, I think both RA and atopic derm share that. But maybe the difference that I see the greatest between the two is that RA is a pretty well-established disease for whom \u2013 even at the time when we launched Xeljanz right there was a lot of treatment, there was a lot of biologics, there was not an oral, but there was a lot of biologics. That in fact is quite different, when we think about where we are with atopic derm in that \u2013 in the atopic derm today, there are just not great treatments. We talked earlier today about -- in the opening about the systemic treatment, right? There's a lot of use of steroids. There is a Dupixent that has been a great solution for many patients. But even with all of that there's just not a lot of solutions at all. And today there is still a high -- there is really a significant unmet need in terms of what patients are being able to do. So I think with all market development with all new treatments, it takes time for you to reach peak. But we believe that given the significant unmet need and in particular for atopic derm patients where I think typically we've been focused on skin clearing, but what we also know for patients is that the number one condition they're suffering from is providers. And that when you have agents that can really resolve that and resolve that very quickly, it will open up opportunities that didn't previously exist before in AD. So that's how I see the market. I think we're really excited about it. We see a great ability to really meet patient unmet needs and that is going to drive our growth. Your second question was around Vyndaqel and how to think about diagnosis versus the people that receive the drug. And I think on this regard what you should expect to see is there will be some gap right? So between those who are diagnosed, there is always a difference between those that are diagnosed and those who are deemed eligible to receive treatment. And then there is a difference between -- or a gap then the next step that you have to take is for those that are treated how many of them actually get the prescription and receive a prescription. And I think that actually on that front we've been doing rather well. This quarter in Q3, 82% of those who were deemed treatment eligible were able to receive a Vyndaqel prescription. And that is in fact up from last quarter where it was actually 78% of those who were deemed eligible for treatment received a script. So the gap is not all that wide and we've seen improvements from last quarter to this one. So I think along the entire patient funnel for Vyndaqel we have great opportunities to improve how the patient flows on diagnosis to treatment, treatment to receiving a script, receiving a script to actually getting the medicines in the hands through specialty pharmacy. It's still a new condition and one that's early in its launch, so I think that we have great opportunities to improve every step of the way. Thank you. Sure. Well, over and above what Albert said, obviously, having clear public education and a well-supported public education effort is going to be critical, right? We need to educate the public on the importance of actually getting the vaccine and then of course, around the safety processes and creating confidence around the development process that has gone into developing these vaccines. And so this happens sort of at two levels: first is about how Pfizer is working through intermediaries and opinion leaders to provide this education; and then secondly what we can do ourselves.  So on the first front, we have already been and are continuing our efforts to work with industry partners, patient organizations, government and other public health institutions to share with them our expertise, so that they can create and build content and also deliver education as they need. So just as I said, this is well underway. There's a multichannel approach. That includes ETC and these experts are already deploying a wide range of channels and forms of communication to educate and to educate specific communities.  On the other hand for us, once we have authorization and once we have a label, we'll be able to do additional communication and more education around our vaccine specifically. We also recognize that of course, there are certain communities that have been minority communities specifically that have been more affected by this disease than others, so we're also supporting the development of specific content and education that can more effectively reach these communities and be more customized with sort of the approach and the content that we are sharing. So this is a very big effort that is already underway and I think you're going to see more and more of this build-up towards the end of the year. Sure. So, we are -- the tanezumab trial represents probably one of the biggest submissions that Pfizer has ever provided the FDA. Our data are extensive, and there's a lot to understand. So we're not surprised by the request to have an AdCom. And in fact we're looking forward to having this opportunity to really review and to discuss what we have seen in our data and in our clinical trials and to discuss this opportunity with the advisory committee. So, we see that as something that will create a good discussion. In terms of the way to look at the opportunity this is how we see it. This is really like many conditions, but this one in particular, a significant unmet need in the treatment of osteoarthritis. There are about 27 million Americans that suffer from this, 11 million of whom have moderate to severe OA. And in the U.S. 80% of those, moderate to severe OA patients, have already trialed and tried and failed three or more analgesics. So we know that these patients are unable today to achieve adequate pain relief. And so while there are options out there, what we also know is that the options are inadequate. And so when you look at the patient population that's ahead of us, the opportunity to provide a novel and a non-opioid form of pain relief, we think that this is the kind of opportunity that I think patients will be very interested in."

            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck and good morning everyone. A great day here in New York. During my remarks, I will discuss our strong third quarter business performance, speak to the progress we are making in the battle against COVID-19, provide an update on our pipeline and how it is setting us up for an anticipated period of sustained growth, and briefly touch on the topic of affordable access to innovative medicines and vaccines. Let's start with an update on our Biopharmaceutical Group. For the quarter, revenues in our biopharma business grew 4% operationally driven primarily by the ongoing strong performance of Vyndaqel/Vyndamax; growth from our leading portfolio of biosimilars; and the continued strength of key brands including Eliquis, IBRANCE, Xeljanz, Inlyta, and XTANDI. Thank you, Umer. And I will ask Mikael to comment on that, just a couple of words before. A study usually -- a pivotal study needs to be blinded, so nobody knows if has received the vaccine or the placebo. That includes the doctor or the nurse, that administer the vaccine, or the patient who is receiving it. And of course all are going to the database and that is locked, with a code so no one can have access, from the Pfizer except a very small team that it is protected with Chinese walls. And of course, the DMC is going to -- is receiving periodically information un-blinded. But not, -- they didn't start yet. So the data monitor committee is -- it's composed by independent experts. But they haven't seen any unblinded data yet. And they haven't performed any analysis -- interim analysis yet. And with that, I will ask Mikael, to speak a little bit about, the specific technical question. Thank you, Mikael. So we move to our next question, please operator? Yes. Thank you. I will ask Angela to speak about the Eliquis. Let me take first a little bit this COVID-19. Look, we are cautiously optimistic that we will have results and possibly an interim analysis. We never \u2013 you never know before you have the final analysis. This cautious optimism is coming from the very strong immunogenicity data that we have very strong neutralizing titers and a very strong T-cell response, excluding CD8, which is one of the important. But as I said, you never know until you have a study readout. And we have reached the last mile here right, so we expect that these things will start coming soon. So let's all have the patience that's required for something so important for public health and global economy. And with that, I will ask Angela to comment on Eliquis. Thank you very much. I will answer the second part and then I will ask Angela actually to walk us through the abrocitinib projections that we are having. We are very confident on the 6% CAGR. And I think we have broken it down to what we believe will take to reach there. Right now if you take the middle point of our guidance with $41.6 billion, we will need additional $14 billion by 2025 to achieve 6% growth. We believe $8 billion are projected to come from our in-line portfolio and we put that during our earnings release. So that means that we are having a $6 billion that need to come from our current pipeline. Based on our projections on the revenue this requires only 40% adjustment. So $6 billion of the $15 billion that we are expecting to have non-risk adjusted in that year is a very good safety margin. That being said, also we generate a lot of cash and we want to invest this cash. And right now our business development strategy, it is to invest in something that we believe can generate significant value for the shareholders and this is to our R&D machine, an R&D machine that has completely turned around its productivity and right now is having industry-leading metrics in the multiple fronts. So our business development will be invested in Phase II \u2013 Phase III-ready programs that could become medicines in the period of 2023, 2024, 2025 2026. And those from one hand can enhance the 6% growth but even more importantly, will allow us to maintain and sustain this growth beyond 2026. So with that clarification and thank you very much Gregg for the question, I would like to ask Angela to speak a little bit about abrocitinib. Thank you, Terence and I understand how the whole world is looking for any possible information. And we try to make sure that we maintain a very responsible way of from one hand being transparent and from the other hand not feeding speculations. So, what I can tell you to your very specific question is, until now, as we are speaking of today, no DMC has not been changed their mandates. There have not been any changes like that. And I can still repeat that we haven't performed any interim analysis yet and that we believe that the analysis will start soon on efficacy. And if the efficacy is positive or if the efficacy is negative, we will announce it. And that will happen a few days after the DMC announce that to us, which usually takes five, six, seven days. And that if it happens before the third week of November, which is very likely because, as I said, we are expecting it soon, a few days before the end of October, a few days after the end of October, but if it happens before the 15th of November, we will announce it before the 15th of November. As I said, right now, no analysis has been performed. DMC is completely blinded in any data. Of course, we are completely blinded in any data. And once we have the conditions met, they will unblind their data and they will start informing us. So, let's all be very patient. I know how much the stress levels are growing. I know how much a vaccine is needed for the world. We are seeing right now the worst fears that we've had before during -- before are becoming true. The COVID is coming back in Europe and the U.S. and globally and we are working very diligently, very carefully to make sure that we will bring this project through the finish line. Thank you. Thank you, Geoff. And no apologies are needed to be asked. I understand that this is very important for the whole world issue. Let me clarify, I'm not bullish that the vaccine will work. I'm cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will work. What I said very clearly it is that we may know by the end of October, if it works or not. And I think -- I reiterate this statement today. It could be -- as I said the October is not for us -- I know it's compared with the elections time. But for us the elections is an artificial milestone. This is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democratic vaccine. That will be the vaccine for the citizens of the world and this is how we see it. So I hope that it is going to be effective. I hope that it is going to be effective with very high protection ability but we have to wait to see the results of the study. Now when it comes to distribution, assuming we have positive data assuming that means that we will be ready to apply in the U.S. for emergency use authorization soon after we received the safety data so the safety data are expected to mature in the third week of November. So let's say, we apply around that time third fourth week of November then it is up to FDA to take as much time as they need to make the approval. It's not up to us so I cannot comment on that. What I know it is -- but we will be ready with product available. Again if all goes well but we are very well undergoing through our plans. We will be ready to distribute an initial number of those. And I believe that in the U.S. that you are asking, we have a contract with the U.S. government that we should provide them 100 million doses by March and we are feeling very good about our ability to do it. But also there's a provision that we should provide 40 million of this million doses in this year. So I think we should be able -- 30 million to 40 million to be able to provide, if we receive approval and if the U.S. government distributes their vaccines. Just to put things into perspective, let's say, 30 million doses it's 15 million people. So if we make available in the U.S. the vaccine that will be for 15 million people by the end of the year which is a very small part of the population. So it's not going to be massively available. It's going to be targeted in its availability. As we move into the first months of 2021 then we are going to have much more massive distribution of the vaccine around the world. So I hope that helps, put things into perspective. Again thank you for the interest. We all keep our fingers crossed that science will win. Again let me take this question. So far we have produced hundreds of thousands of those and we are moving very rapidly with both sites to start initiating a much larger production. When it comes to thinking through, I don't think I can help you think more than what we have said so far. We are blinded events will accumulate. We will unblind the data. DMC will tell us negative positive or continue. If it is negative or positive we will let you know. If it is -- and then if it is continue, we will continue until the next milestone is reached. There's nothing else to think. But as I said, we will start this process very soon. Now for IBRANCE I'll ask Angela to comment. Yeah. Thank you, Navin, and again I understand the interest here. I don't want to comment much more. But what we see is our infection rates that they're aligned with what we see in the country. That's not something to be a surprise, because it's a large study that we try to position geographically in multiple sites that represent basically the country in the U.S. where we have the bulk of the patients. The increase of 30,000 to 44,000 anyway wouldn't make any difference in the early readouts. It would only make a difference because of the larger numbers at the very, very late readouts. So I don't think that was the reason, but we did it. It was mainly, because we felt very good about the safety profile, so we started \u2013 we opened our vaccination to kids of 16 years old in beginning then we went to 12 years old, and then we went to people that they are suffering from HIV, from hepatitis B, from hepatitis C. So this is why. And also we use it to improve the diversity of the study which we have made it public so it's very, very good right now. I feel very good about the diversity of our study. So Navin thanks for your question. Let's all keep our fingers crossed, but we will have positive readouts. Yeah. Excellent questions, both I think are appropriate to be answered by Angela. So Angela, why don't we start with abrocitinib and how you think the market will evolve given the experience on RA and JAKs? And then of course in VYNDAQEL what \u2013 how that change between diagnosis and treatment can evolve over time? Yes. Steve, I appreciate the curiosity and I appreciate the creativity and everybody can try every possible angle, but I think I have answered this as fully as we are prepared. Now you used a very creative way of asking, so I will tell you clearly, no, we don't have the 32 events right now. So that's what I can say. So -- and I have to say, I backtracked can you remind me what was the second part of the question? Mikael, maybe you can take that? Thank you, Tim for asking a non-COVID question. Appreciate it really. And also it came at the time that I thought Frank will not have a chance to speak, but now we are giving him the exact right forum. So Frank, take it from here. Thank you, Frank. Thanks, Tim. And we move to our next question, please. Yes. Let me take the first before I pass it to Frank. And actually I will ask the help of Angela here also in answering this question. I do see because we are launching the polls and also I speak to people, my neighbors, my friends and I do see that there is some skepticism that has been mainly because of the politicization of the vaccine. So this is real and I think we need to address it. But we started addressing it long time back. We are doing for this disease -- for this vaccine things that we have never done before. And those are first of all things that have to do with transparency. We have published our protocol. We have -- we are publishing real-time our Phase I data to our community and the public, but also the other scientists and the other companies that are developing COVID vaccines can see them and learn from them. We have announced the first results of our pivotal study unblinded data, of course, on the safety. We signed a pledge, but make very clear to the world that we are going to follow the high ethical and quality standards. And we will continue being very transparent and very quality science-driven, which I think it is the best way to overcome the public's opinion. So by the way, we didn't even take money from the government. So to make sure that Pfizer will stay out of the politics. And this vaccine at our risk -- financial risk would not be characterized as the Republican vaccine or the Democratic vaccine. It's not -- it is a vaccine for the world that we are developing. Now going forward, I think, we will do also -- will continue doing things. Our safety data according to the FDA will be reviewed publicly by an advisory committee so that will be another additional good step. As for transparency, Angela you want also to add a few things that we are planning to do? Thank you, Angela. And before I ask Frank to take the question about cost of enabling functions, I would like also Mikael to comment about our pharmacovigilance program that we have put in place and how that also could play a significant role in ensuring about the vaccine's safety. Mikael? Thank you, Mikael. Now Frank, back to you. Angela, why don't you take those two? And then also, maybe Mikael can comment later on the discussion with FDA, but you first Angela. Thank you, Angela. Mikael, anything to add about tanezumab filing, and FDA's request for advisory committee? Thank you, Mikael. Chuck, back to you. Thank you, David. My definition of conclusive result positive or negative, it is a futility or a demonstrated efficacy, readout in the primary endpoint. That's how things work. So, Frank? All right. Thanks, Frank. And operator, can we take our last question for the call please. Thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Now about the out-of-pocket costs. Pfizer repeatedly and the industry as a whole has pointed out that right now the way that the insurance benefits are working is not sustainable anymore. Right now, the Americans pay out-of-pocket for their medicines likely they do not have insurance, although they do have and they took a very expensive likely very good assuming they didn't have to pay from their own pocket. So this is something that needs to change. And it seems like there is a general recognition both -- in both sides of the aisle. We will continue working with all and we hope that we will see a change in the design of these benefits that will reduce the cost that the Americans have to pay out-of-pocket when they go to collect their medicines. This is not something that needs to be done because it will help the financial bottom lines of the industry. This is because it needs to help the patients and the health care system cost in general. Right now the fact that some patients don't have the out-of-pocket to take their medicine as a result that we have significant numbers that they do not take their medicines, but medicines that are needed, medicines that have been prescribed by the physician. And as a result patients are ending up in the health care system in hospitals and they cause the health care system much more. So there is a need, any way you see it cost-wise or human paying-wise this needs to be reformed. Now in terms of COVID-19 and I think that was the last question that we have today. So it looks like it's going to be a COVID-19 in the last question. I think right now we are planning to as always these things to have a press release that we'll speak about top line met the endpoint or not. And then of course, we plan to publish data in a peer review magazine so that they will be all available. But keep in mind that once we submit data, if things goes according to plan by the third, fourth week of November there'll be also -- I think they plan to make them public during the AdCom, advisory committee that they will have. So I think that concludes our call, Chuck isn't it? Yes. So I just want to thank all of you for joining us today, of course your continued engagement with Pfizer. As you just heard, our continued strong performance speaks to the resiliency of our business and the strength of our portfolio, the ingenuity and the resolve of our people and I think the power of our products. As we indicated during our Investor Day, we are very confident in our pipeline. We like its breadth, we like its depth and we will continue to be opportunistic about bringing in additional promising assets where appropriate. Now we need to continue to execute and deliver for patients. Of course, we continue to monitor global economies related to COVID impact. COVID is affecting not only our business  to quantify the opportunity today to us. But if we try to quantify the opportunity what it's doing to the global economy, we are speaking about 3 years. And now it has become more obvious than any time that many things need to be done to control this pandemic. Vaccines are expected if successful to play a key role to become a very important tool. We are working very diligently. I understand and appreciate your interest that became very obvious. I just ask everybody to be a little bit patient. So -- and we all cross our fingers that science would win. Thank you very much everyone."

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Yeah. Thank you for the question. So Umer, we have as you know two primary endpoints. The first relates to, impact of naive patients to the first infection. And the second one relates to the same, but also adding, re-infection in those that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. We use PCR machines on a commercial platform that, we have thoroughly validated. And feel very comfortable with. And use established criteria for positive cases. The central read in our large laboratory is the crucial one here. We are also able at the end of the study to look at patients that did not develop symptoms, since as you said we are particularly focused on illness cases. So we use a serology test for the nucleocapsid protein that, allow us also to look at impact at the end of the trial for patients that were asymptomatic. The symptom in the scale that we use was established in consultation with many KOL and FDA. But we also have secondary endpoint that uses CDC's symptom scale. So I think, hopefully that covered many aspects of your questions. Absolutely. I think Steve you first asked will Phase 3 start this year. We expect and I believe Phase 3 will start this year and relatively soon. As you know the profile through modification of the steroid dose from one mg per kg to two mg per kg looks really great now. And Albert spoke in his introduction to the 19 treated boys, in which in the recent, after the steroid change we have had no cases with complement activation so we're very excited about the current plan. Now for the assay, yes, as part of our final protocol development with FDA, we changed from an initial inverted terminal repeat methodology to a transient method as suggested by FDA along with the weight of the patients to determine those. And that's all in place and made the initial dose of what was expressed as 3E14 go down to the 2E14. It's the very same dose that we use all the time. It's just that the different assay gives a different readout. But all of that is in place. We have a terrific technology platform that I think is the leading in this field how to measure the various endpoints including the concentration of the virus gene therapy. Thank you, Albert. So we have the pharmacovigilance platform in the industry that has experience to handle the largest number of the adverse event reporting by far. And we have started very proactively and been in open dialogue with the operation with speed and FDA about putting this pharmacovigilance platform to play, to monitor sophisticated participant whether viewing a potential EUA and later approval. And that includes building control cohorts already now for understanding continuous disease reporting of what we expect to be the first group of responders such as health care workers and first-line responders.  We also recognize the big need for many stakeholders from pharmacists, nurses, patients, physicians to have access to rapid information. We have a very strong medical information platform across the globe and we have now augmented it both with staff and with self-serving Webex platform to be able to respond to many aspects of how we store, distribute the vaccine and expected so far mild to moderate tolerability et cetera seen with this vaccine and similar vaccines. So I think we feel we are very well prepared for that. Thank you. I thought Angela answered great. Maybe I can add two things. As a potential first-in-class treatment, it's not uncommon for the FDA to hold an AdCom to discuss the submission. So in a way, it was expected. And of course, the discussion will be focused on those many patients that are not well controlled or unresponsive, not eligible who do not want to take any of the existing pain medication, and as an alternative to longer use of opioids, that's where the discussion will be. And as Angela said, we always welcome AdComs in order to share our experience and get external perspective."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Frank D'Amelio",
            "content": "Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the quarterly financials. Our Biopharma business, which will become new Pfizer, following the close of the Upjohn transaction, generated $10.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, which represented 84% of total company revenue. On an operational basis, Biopharma revenue grew 4% in the quarter and 7% for the first nine months of the year. The 7% year-to-date operational revenue growth for Biopharma was driven by continued solid volume growth and our price-to-volume mix was a 9% increase in volume and a 2% negative impact from price. For Upjohn, although the year-over-year comparison is skewed again by the impact of generic Lyrica and changes in the China market, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations and assumptions already reflected in our Upjohn guidance for the year. Now moving down the income statement. I'll touch quickly on gross margin, which saw a slight negative impact during the quarter, mainly driven by lower sales from Lyrica, Celebrex, Lipitor and Norvasc, which are all part of our Upjohn business, as well as some incremental costs due to COVID 19. There was some offset to this impact due to lower inventory write-offs compared to the year ago quarter. We had another quarter where we saw a significant year-over-year decline in adjusted SI&A expenses, which were down 10% operationally. There are two obvious factors at work here: the exclusion of consumer health expenses and lower selling expenses due to COVID; but also a third factor, which is a planned reduction in spending associated with our corporate-enabling functions. We're in the midst of aligning those functions to the new Pfizer structure, which will be a smaller and less complex organization. We are finalizing this initiative and we'll be able to better quantify the expected financial benefit when we provide our 2021 financial guidance for new Pfizer. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was down significantly compared to the year ago quarter, mainly driven by the non-recurrence of a one-time gain from the consumer joint venture formation in the year ago quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was down 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.01 lower compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenues in the quarter by about $100 million or 1%. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance a few points here regarding our assumptions. The guidance continues to only include the adverse spending on our COVID vaccine candidate, but does not include any potential revenue we may receive this year if the vaccine is authorized and we deliver doses to various governments where we have agreements. In terms of our broader COVID-related assumptions, we expect the gradual recovery in healthcare activity for the remainder of the year. I'd also note that upon the closing of the Upjohn transaction, we will treat the Upjohn business as a discontinued operation. So assuming the completion of the Upjohn transaction before December 31, the financial guidance we are providing will not be aligned with the ultimate numbers we print for the year. I'll start by saying, there were no changes made to either the new Pfizer or Upjohn 2020 guidance factors and only slight refinements to total company guidance. For total company, we are tightening our guidance range for revenues, which results in a small decrease in our midpoint and this is mainly a factor of reducing the top end of the range, as opposed to a change in our forecast. Costs as a percentage of revenue is slightly increased, mainly due to COVID-related costs, while the SI&A range is lowered a bit at the midpoint, mainly COVID, and enabling function-driven and R&D increases slightly mainly due to additional COVID program spending. This nets out to a slight increase in the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS range. Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer and Upjohn which is shown here. As I referenced, we are not making any changes to either new Pfizer or to Upjohn. Moving on to key takeaways, in the third quarter, our company performed well, driven by strong revenue growth, from our biopharma business. We narrowed ranges for our 2020 total company guidance for revenues, cost of sales, SI&A, R&D, and adjusted diluted EPS. And we reaffirmed our existing guidance components for both, new Pfizer and Upjohn. We also achieved multiple product and pipeline milestones, since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here. A more complete listing can be found in this morning's press release. Finally, we paid $6.3 billion to our shareholders in the first nine months of this year. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns, in 2020, and beyond. Now I'll turn it back over to Chuck. Thank you, Albert. And Tim thanks for the question. So on M&A, we always say we never say never because one of the nice things about being part of Pfizer is we have the firepower to pretty much do any kind of a deal we want and I think we've been able to demonstrate that in the past. So I wouldn't limit us or cap us on some specific dollar amount given the firepower that we have. Albert mentioned earlier, our focus has been mid-phase, Phase II, Phase III kind of things that would impact our revenue base 2024, 2025, 2026. But in terms of capacity quite frankly, we're very much unlimited, strong balance street, strong capital structure, strong investment grade. We generate lots of operating cash flow. So we're in a very good position quite frankly to be very proactive as we need to be on M&A. And then in terms of your Upjohn question. From my perspective, we get the Upjohn deal done. We form Viatris. We're going to get $12 billion in cash. Our intent with that $12 billion in cash is to pay down debt given we're transferring give or take about $4 billion of EBITDA to Upjohn. But our capital deployment priorities don't change as a result of that transaction. We'll still return capital to our shareholders as we have been doing. We'll continue to invest in the business and our pipeline obviously and capital and then we'll continue to invest in M&A. So from my perspective capital priorities don't change. And in terms of M&A capacity, we're fortunate enough where we really have lots of capacity and lots of firepower. Yes. And Randall the way I'll do this let me run some numbers and provide some I'll call it financial context. And then I'll drill down and I'll answer your question. So just first on SI&A because you're talking about the enabling function so on SI&A for the quarter we were $2.87 billion. We were down 10% year-over-year. It was really driven by three things: on the consumer separations, which was give or take about half the reduction; reduced spending in enabling functions; and some of it was COVID-driven. I called that out because a piece of that is enabling functions, which was probably what triggered the question.  Now let me run the overall numbers and then I'll drill down and answer the question. So our previous guidance on SI&A for the year was $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. We tightened the range to $11.5 billion to $12 billion and that was really driven by COVID savings because obviously we knew about consumer, we had enabling function spending already in our plan. So it was really driven primarily by COVID spending. Then of that $11.5 billion to $12 billion, I think $4 billion to $4.5 billion is the enabling functions, which is now getting to your question.  The way I think about this is you look at that $4 billion to $4.5 billion as an either/or an expense-to-revenue ratio of the total company as it exists today and the new company when we're a smaller company because of the revenues that move to Viatris. We want that expense-to-revenue ratio to be the same or less than what it currently is today. So that's kind of a simple way to think about how we're thinking about this and how we are planning in terms of what to do with our enabling functions.  Then the question you asked was Frank, you asked me a pacing question. In terms of 2021, '22, we'll obviously go as fast as we can and get as much of it as we can into 2021. Obviously, some of it will fall into 2022 just because of the nature of some of the places where we do business and certain things taking more time than others. And I'll provide more clarity on this when we provide our 2021 guidance including the SI&A guidance on our next earnings call. Yeah. Thanks Albert. So Dave, we have been reducing the enabling functions over the years, and that's obviously been reflected in the guidance that we've provided over the last year or two. That $4 billion to $4.5 billion should be thought of as a base for 2025. And obviously, we'll go to work on that base and we are going to work on that base as we move into 2021 and 2022. And the intent is obviously to generate -- to capture as much of those savings as we can, as quickly as we can. But the $4 billion to $4.5 billion think about that as the base that we'll come off of."

Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2020 financial results, our updated 2020 financial guidance, Pfizer's progress in helping find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other relevant business topics. I'm joined today as usual by our Chairman and CEO, Albert Bourla; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; John Young, our Chief Business Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. The slides that will be presented during this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at Pfizer.com/investors. You'll see here that Slide 3 covers our legal disclosures. Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Albert Bourla. Albert?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss our second quarter business performance, provide an update our pipeline and, of course, speak to the progress we are making to combat the global public health challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our continued strong performance speaks to the resilience of our business, even during the most challenging times. The second quarter was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19. Revenues in the quarter included an estimated net unfavorable impact of approximately $500 million, or 4% due to COVID-19, primarily reflecting unfavorable disruption to wellness visits for pediatric and declines in adult patients in the U.S. and lower demand for certain products in China. These declines were partially offset by increased U.S. demand for certain Sterile Injectable products, increased adult demand for Prevnar 13 in certain international markets. Let me start with an update on our biopharmaceuticals group. For the quarter, our Biopharma business grew 6% operationally, driven by strong performances from many of our key growth drivers, including Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Ibrance, Inlyta, Xtandi and our biosimilars portfolio. Our oncology business was particularly strong, up 20% operationally compared with a year ago quarter. Global Ibrance revenues increased 9% operationally to $1.3 billion during the quarter. In the U.S. Ibrance revenues grew 11% and Ibrance continues to retain a strong leadership position within the CDK class. The international markets delivered strong 18% volume growth in the quarter. This volume growth was partially offset by price reductions in certain EU markets, which resulted in 3% operational revenue growth outside in the U.S. The price reductions occurred last year as a result of renegotiating long-term agreements and we expect the impact will continue through to the fourth quarter of 2020 when the price changes annualize.\nFrank D'Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. Starting with total company revenue, we generated $11.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down 9% operationally versus the year ago quarter. As in each of the last three quarters, the majority of this decline is due to the fact that we no longer report revenues for our Consumer Healthcare business. Adjusting for Consumer, total company revenues declined 3% operationally. As a reminder, the formation of the Consumer joint venture with GSK will annualize on July 31, so next quarter will be the last one impacted by this negative driver. Albert did a really nice job of describing the revenue drivers for each of our businesses so I won't repeat them, but I do want to make one additional point on each business to punctuate what he said. For Biopharma, the growth that we are seeing is not reliant on net price increases. In fact, on a global basis, net price had a negative 2% impact on Biopharma growth this quarter and in the U.S., net price was flat. These dynamics are consistent with the pricing environment we have seen for several years now, and we continue to believe that pricing will not contribute to our expected growth for the foreseeable future. For Upjohn, it is important to point out that despite a 31% operational decline in revenue this quarter, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations and the assumptions reflected in our initial Upjohn guidance. I should also point out that the 31% becomes minus 6%, excluding the impact of the Lyrica LOE. Now moving down the income statement, we had another quarter with significant declines in adjusted SI&A expenses, which were down 17% operationally. Nearly half of that decline was due to the fact that we no longer report expenses for the Consumer Healthcare business. The remainder of the decrease was driven primarily by decreased sales and marketing activities compared to the prior year quarter due to restrictions on in-person meetings with health care professionals primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, lower spending associated with corporate enabling functions. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was down significantly compared to the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by a onetime favorable tax settlement recorded in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was down 2% compared to the prior year second quarter. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, adjusted diluted EPS was flat compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenues in the quarter by $277 million or 2%. On Slide 13, we are providing an update to the detailed assumptions reflected in our current financial guidance related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Broadly speaking, we anticipate an ongoing gradual global recovery from the macroeconomic and health care impacts experienced during the second quarter of 2020 beginning in Q3 of 2020. The guidance also assumes we'll be able to continue to operate our manufacturing and supply chain without material disruption and that we will continue investing in potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 throughout 2020 but does not include any revenues for a COVID-19 vaccine candidate given that it has not yet been approved. With that in mind, let's take a look at our guidance. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance. Beginning with total company, we are raising our guidance range for revenues by $100 million and our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 based on the strength and resiliency we see in our business and the dedication of our colleagues despite the challenges inherent in operating during this current global pandemic. We are reaffirming all of the components of our 2020 financial guidance for total company. I want to point out that although changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-April have marginally benefited our full year outlook for revenue and adjusted diluted EPS, today's guidance increases are not primarily driven by changes in foreign exchange. And as a reminder, we maintained both of these guidance ranges last quarter despite absorbing much larger negative impacts from foreign exchange. Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer and Upjohn. Both of the changes we made for total Pfizer guidance this quarter are reflected in the updates you see here to our new Pfizer financial guidance. On the Upjohn side, all financial guidance components are being reaffirmed, reflecting that the performance of that business continues to track in line with our expectations. Moving on to key takeaways. In the second quarter, our company performed well, driven by the strong 6% operational revenue growth from our Biopharma business. We raised our 2020 total company and new Pfizer guidance ranges for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS, and we reaffirmed all of the components of our financial guidance, including all guidance ranges for our Upjohn business. We raised sufficient funding through our Upjohn subsidiary to satisfy the $12 billion dividend to be paid to Pfizer upon the close of the combination of Upjohn with Mylan, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. We also achieved multiple product and pipeline milestones since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here. A more complete listing can be found in this morning's press release. Finally, we paid $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders in the first half of this year. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. \nChuck Triano: Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we now please start to poll for questions?\nOperator:  Your first question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. \nSteve Scala: Well, thank you. One for Frank. Pfizer delivered a much stronger quarter while some peers, including Novartis and Roche, were not as strong, yet the businesses are not that different. To what do you attribute the disparity that we're seeing in the industry? Is it product portfolio or cycle? Is it geography or is it execution? And then maybe for Mikael regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, can you elaborate on the immunogenicity and safety in older adults that was touched upon in the press release? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Steve. Frank, why don't you take the first question? And maybe, Angela, also you can chime in and then if \u2013 Mikael will answer the COVID question. Frank?\nFrank D'Amelio: Sure. Good morning, Steve. So Steve, obviously, I can't comment on what some of our competitors printed for the quarter. But obviously, we had a strong quarter, and I think I can attribute it to, quite frankly, the excellent execution that we continue to deliver. If you look at the Biopharma business, really strong strength across the portfolio, 6% operational growth, about $600 million in revenue, VYNDAQEL \u2013 I'm rounding the numbers. VYNDAQEL was up $200 million, Eliquis was up $200 million, IBRANCE was up $100 million, Inlyta was up $100 million, so really, really strong performance. And by the way, overall, that's despite $500 million hit to revenue from COVID, $400 million of which was in our Biopharma business. Then if you look at our spending, I think we've done a nice job on managing our spending. Obviously, we're getting some help from COVID, but if you look at the rest of the business, we continue to be disciplined on how we spend money. So I think all in, I think we're continuing to execute in a very effective way.\nAlbert Bourla: Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Just to build up what Frank said, I think in addition to the execution, which was a critical element of this, we also have a product portfolio, which, in combination, really worked well together. As you said, there are parts of our portfolio that are similar to others, but this particular collection of disease areas is quite unique. You have oncology and our internal medicine, cardiology business that did not have \u2013 didn't feel and didn't experience the kind of downturn in new Rxs unlike some other portfolios. You had the hospital BU that pulled through. You had portfolios that are very much about continuing patients, the large base of patients that are continuing with their medicine. So I think that it really speaks to the strength and the diversity of this portfolio and the unique attributes that make it very resilient in a time like this.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, thank you for the question. We are very pleased with our \u2013 both actually the b1 and the b2 vaccine candidate. And as we know, we have selected b2 and now started dosing of patients in a late stage trial. We have started b2 in near 120 patients in the Phase 1. And for the specific questions on the older adults, we were very pleased with the safety and tolerability seen in older adults after both the first injection and the boost. In general, mild to moderate reactions whether locally or systemic and overall, a very stable tolerability profile. We also reported neutralizing antibodies after the boost, day 28, that exceeded a panel of convalescent plasma, which was very rewarding to see. Finally, I want to punctuate that in addition to neutralizing antibodies, our mRNA vaccine also elicits potent antiviral T cell activation, including CD8 T cells that have been implied as key cellular mediator to control viral infection, including coronaviruses.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And Steve, I can't resist also adding that as you are looking at new Pfizer, what we are trying to build, a much more science-focused Pfizer, you will see three themes: excellence in execution, speed and agility. And you will see that across commercial with the results that you see; across R&D with our ability to advance a program like COVID, very complicated, in such a speed; and across manufacturing, where in the middle of a pandemic, we maintain all our operational units up and running. And we experienced virtually very, very little stock disruptions in a period that demand for some injectables went five, four, six times up. Please go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Yes, thank you. A couple of questions, please. Long-term guidance in the past, you've said at least 6 on a five-year CAGR basis, and that excluded anything from COVID-19 in terms of vaccine contribution. Does that guidance still stand? And then second question on IBRANCE. When we see full PALACE results, will there be an obvious reason why the trial failed? Was it mostly a compliance issue, for example? If so, then it seems like docs would likely stick with the brand. But you could argue it the other way, too, which is your product, while it was first to market and the class is the only one that doesn't have a survival benefit in metastatic and in adjuvant, it didn't work. So I guess can you just kind of give us a little bit of insight into PALACE results? And are you confident that IBRANCE remains a growth brand over time?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Let me answer the first one and then Mikael will speak about the PALACE. The answer is absolutely. It is not 6%, it is at least 6% and that we reiterate and we feel much stronger right now. And that excludes obviously any impact of COVID on the top line. And as I explained multiple times in investor events, the reason why our approximately 6% went to at least 6% while we lost PALACE was because for PALACE, we had $2 billion of revenues in our projections at 50% probability of success, so we lost $1 billion. But at the same time, since we had given the 6%, we advanced \u2013 we had successful Phase 3 study in adults, pneumococcal. We have successful POCs in multiple vaccines, which we advanced already right now to Phase 3. Three vaccines, as I spoke, we advanced in Phase III. We have Duchenne muscle dystrophy, positive POC. We have a lot of positive news that when we update the probability of success in our model, more than offset the PALACE. And with that, I want to ask Mikael to comment on why he thinks PALACE failed.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, thank you for the question. We are now analyzing data and details, looking at various sub looking at various sub-analysis and sensitivities. So it's still too early to have a view on what made this study not successful. And as Albert alluded to, IBRANCE has been and is a very strong brand in the metastatic setting. It has a favorable tolerability profile and is supported by a number of randomized controlled clinical studies. And I wanted to just add that real-world data studies have also replicated a progression-free survival and added overall survival data using real-world evidence for IBRANCE in the metastatic setting. Now we'll continue to share with you the learnings we have. And of course, we have the PENELOPE-B study to read out, which we can't comment on. It includes a different patient type than in PALACE.\nChuck Triano: Maybe Angela could add on the commercial front for IBRANCE?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Thanks, Chuck. Actually, we continue to see great opportunities in the metastatic indication for IBRANCE. As you can tell, we are firmly entrenched as a leader in metastatic. And even recent research that we conducted with our prescribers, our physician prescribers indicate that they see early treatment, so the early indication as well as metastatic indication quite differently, and that what is being within each of these indications will have their own role. So when you look at our market share, both in terms of in-line as well as across all the lines, after five years in the market, IBRANCE has consistently had dominant market share. So we come into this with a \u2013 with confidence in owning metastatic. But I think it's also important to remember the experience and the confidence that both prescribers and patients have in this \u2013 the metastatic disease that has been established through time. And to build off of what Mikael said, we do have overall survival benefit. And we saw that in our real-world studies, and we're the only CDK inhibitor that has these real-world studies. And certainly, these studies will further strengthen our leadership in metastatic. So I think on all accounts, when we look at where we are, the real-world data that we've generated, the experience as well as new data and new studies that are ongoing that demonstrate that patients can be retreated. So therefore, if you have already treated a patient early, you can \u2013 with a different CDK, you can certainly retreat them again when they become metastatic with something like an IBRANCE. And so on all accounts, we continue to be very bullish about our position with IBRANCE in metastatic cancer, metastatic breast cancer. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. \nVamil Divan: Hi, great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple, if I could, one on the vaccine. I'm just curious, I guess, for Mikael, based on what we know now, do you expect this COVID vaccine would be a recurring vaccine that people would take annually or to be just sort of two shots initially? And I guess the reason I'm asking is, when you think about sort of the longer-term outlook, I think a lot of people wanted a Pfizer outlook beyond 2026 when you start losing patent protection for some of your key products. Do you see this as potentially a meaningful contributor at that point in time? Or is it maybe more of an opportunity for the next two to three years?  And then my other question is just back on the executive orders. I appreciate the comments you made, Albert, in your prepared remarks. Just any \u2013 I know there's supposed to be a meeting today potentially with the Trump administration to discuss the orders that was canceled. I'm wondering if you have any insights you can share on that. Or are there any other plans to discuss on that. Or are there any other plans to discuss the orders with the administration over the next month or so? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. On the first question, Mikael can speak, but also, I think Angela can add how we see this evolution. So \u2013 and then I will answer the second one. Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you for the question. Of course, there is a lot of unknown here with a disease that has just been known to the medical community for maybe six months. But we have seen a dramatic expansion of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 across the globe, including appearance of new variants. So we look upon it as in two phases. The first one is the pandemic phase where, of course, coming with a safe, high-quality efficacious vaccine soon is important. And that's why we are so pleased to be able to announce, as we did yesterday, dosing of patients in our pivotal trial. And for that, a two-shot vaccine is likely to give a protection if successful in the clinical study based on both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated, the CD8 T cells that seems to be important in protection against viruses.  Considering the \u2013 beyond the pandemic phase, which may likely, at the global level, last a few years, it is hard to be certain about the future. But I do think there are scenarios which are very reasonable and we need to be prepared for, that COVID-19 has established itself as a prominent virus, as much circulating in society as flu. And as we will understand the \u2013 how long-lasting the various vaccines are, it will allow us to better predict how often one should consider to reimmunize. A platform such as mRNA has the advantage that there is no anti-vector immunity and if needed, you could immunize annually every two years, every four years. And I just wanted to add that beyond being a very important pillar in the future defense against COVID-19 and probably reasonable to assume that there will be other coronaviruses, as we have seen how they have accumulated in a recombined form in many different species, but this platform will be possible to also disrupt platform will be possible to also disrupt the flu market, novel vaccines against CMV and even to go into a novel age group of RSV. So we see a very large opportunity based on the leadership we have with this mRNA platform, particularly by being able to engage both neutralizing antibodies and antiviral CD8 cells. Angela?\nAngela Hwang: So picking up on your \u2013 the points about the two phases. Some additional comments on these two phases. I think when it comes to the pandemic phase, we're thinking about it from the perspective of the fact that it could last until the end of 2021 or into 2022 where high volumes of doses will need to be provided for mass vaccinations to mass vaccinations to take place, right? And so I think in this pandemic period, the way that we're thinking about it, and as you've seen, is that we're pricing the vaccine for broad access. Broad access is our main goal and making sure that we can supply it to multiple governments around the world. After that, the next phase is a phase where we think it will become more standard, more seasonal, as you've described it, I think, where we anticipate that we will have to have continued vaccination for a number of years. And this is going to be important to create and maintain the herd immunity globally. So in this time period, we anticipate to return to more regular supply channels and a more value-based pricing approach. So a combination of both of these two is how we see the next many years playing out.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. And thank you Mikael. That was very comprehensive, I think. Now as regards to the executive order, as I said, obviously, I was very disappointed to see those orders coming because I feel that they are coming at a period of time that this is not what is needed. This is a period of time that our scientists are working to develop a vaccine or a treatment, and our manufacturing workers are working day and night to maintain, under COVID conditions, supply of medicines and also provide additional supplies for this vaccine. They should worry only about how to defeat this virus and how to maintain the supply and should not start worrying about their jobs. I think the timing was wrong. And I believe that there is a need for a dialogue so that we can move forward, like look backwards. But clearly, there is a need for \u2013 on the technical level first, to be an agreement. I don't think there is a need for, right now, for White House meetings. There is a need for people that they understand the topics from both sides, work to find solutions how we can decrease the contribution \u2013 how can we decrease the out-of-pocket expense of the Americans that has gone to levels that they are unacceptable right now. This is the real problem and this is what we see that we need to reform. Thank you. Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.\nRandall Stanicky: Great, thanks. Albert, I wanted to follow up on the last question. The vaccine opportunity could be a very big one but perhaps may not sell for the 2026 LOE and arguably could add to it. So as you think about business development priorities near term, has anything changed on that front? And when can we expect to see Pfizer get more active there? And then the second question, just on the vaccine, how should we think about U.S. versus OUS pricing given that you disclosed the U.S. contract with the U.S. government, but we may not get color OUS? Thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you. Very good questions, both of them. In our M&A strategy, nothing has changed. It is exactly what we have defined. We are in the street to be aggressive and deploy capital to license in or acquire early to mid-stage aggressive and deploy capital to license in or acquire early to mid-stage clinical projects that could become medicines in the years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and then they can start picking their sales so that we can maintain post-2026 the 6% growth. And that has not changed. We never say never to anything, particularly if people are asking if we want to do a big acquisition. We never say never to anything. And by the way, our firepower allow us to do vertically \u2013 virtually anything that we could decide. But our strategic direction is clear, laser-focused on this area so that we can maintain the growth. And we did have significant achievements in that front. I will mention to you the last two vaccines that we licensed in, which is the Lyme vaccine a few months ago and the COVID vaccine in our agreement with BioNTech. What was the second question?\nChuck Triano: It was U.S. pricing versus outside pricing for the vaccine. \nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Why don\u2019t I let Angela answer the question on the U.S. pricing of the vaccine?\nAngela Hwang: The pricing strategy for our vaccines is universal across the board. And it is based on volumes, advanced commitments, equity and affordability principles. So this agreement in the U.S. that you referred to relates to the first 100 million doses for which Pfizer will receive $1.95 billion, and this is assuming the regulatory approval or authorization. And if the government would like to purchase an additional 500 million doses, it would be at that same price and it's also subject to future mutual agreements. Switching over to the EU or ex U.S., I think, was your other question, how we're thinking about that. Again, we're using the same pricing principles across the globe. And specifically, I won't be able And specifically, I won't be able to disclose to you the content of those confidential discussions. But again, the principles are the same. And because of that, no country in the developed world will receive doses at a lower price than the U.S. for similar volume commitments.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. And I want to emphasize what Angela said in her statement that no country in the developed world, which means Europe, Japan, all the countries that are developed right now, will not receive a lower price for the same volume commitment than the U.S. But that, of course, excludes African countries or other countries that they don't have the means to pay over there. We may do exceptions and offer it to lower price. Thank you very much, Angela. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. \nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all the progress of the vaccine. I guess this might be a question for Frank. Just wondering, based on the commentary in the press question for Frank. Just wondering, based on the commentary in the press release versus what you guys outlined in the first quarter, it seems to suggest that maybe you're now assuming a somewhat more gradual recovery in the second half. Just wondering if I'm interpreting that correctly. And is that driven by global data points you guys are seeing? Or is that really a result of what's been going on in some states in the U.S.? And then the second question relates to the Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine program. Was just wondering if you can give any more details on the powering assumptions of the primary end point. And then also, you talk about the interim analyses. Any more details on that front? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Frank, go ahead, please.\nFrank D'Amelio: Yes. So Terence, you're absolutely right. We talked about a gradual recovery in the quarter. And we're saying that in terms of patient visits to doctors, vaccination rates, elective surgeries, where we're expecting a gradual increase, a gradual improvement over Q2 levels beginning in Q3. Same thing with new-to-brand prescriptions, where we're expecting a gradual improvement over 2Q levels beginning in Q3. And then in the U.S., just a gradual improvement in terms of our reps visiting and getting to meet face-to-face with health care professionals. So it's definitely a gradual improvement. That's an update from the language we put into Q1, and most importantly, all of which we have factored into the latest guidance that we provided to you all today for 2020. And that includes total company, new Pfizer and the Upjohn guidance that we provided. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very, very much, Frank. And Mikael, can you speak a little bit about our study design, the powering assumptions, interim analysis, et cetera.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you for the question. So we started dosing yesterday in which will be 30,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 85. We have more than 30 states in U.S. picked in areas that will contribute to both enrollment as well as event rate, and that is supplemented by South America and Europe sites. When it comes to how the study will be executed, it is currently assumed that we will have sufficient number of individuals enrolled by early September to allow several interim analysis to support potential filing that could start in September or in October, depending on event rates as well as vaccine efficacy. And at this time point, I think I don't want to give more details. The primary endpoint is efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 in participants without evidence of infection before vaccination as well as efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 in participants with and without evidence of infection before vaccination. And we use PCR technology to confirm infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as using antibody tests to confirm previous exposure. So all in all, it's well-powered study to detect a meaningful vaccine efficacy, and interim analysis would lead to opportunity to start planning for filing from September running into October. And this is, of course, pending our assumptions on event rate. I want to say that our assumptions were made a few weeks ago, looking at incidence of disease in U.S. and elsewhere. And over the last few weeks, unfortunately, the incidence rate has made the disease even more prevalent. So if anything, we would expect on that planning to be able to hit event rates sooner rather than later, which is, of course, favorable for a potential filing of this vaccine September to October time frame.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Mikael. And again, we said it very clearly in our press release. The study design has been discussed extensively with FDA, and we are following all the guidelines that FDA has put out there. And that should be the golden standard for anyone who is doing studies for COVID-19. We can go to the next question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So my first question is basically, there have been some concerns that Pfizer could have a hard time meeting this 6% CAGR projection or at least 6% CAGR projection through 2025. What do you think the street is missing here? And then at your upcoming Investor Day, on the R&D Day, what kind of new data and pipeline can we expect to see? And what do you hope to address, the key things that you want to address at this meeting? And then last question I have for you is as you move towards being a biopharma pure play, what kind of margin expansion can we expect to see over the next several years? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: I will answer the 6%, and then I will ask John Young to speak a little bit what you should expect during the R&D Day. And then obviously, Frank can speak about the margin expansions. Now, as I said, the 6% CAGR, we feel very, very strongly about it. And I don't think that the time horizon on this call will allow me to speak about the entry that we have in our models that I don't see, frankly, in most of the analyst expectations, but let me try. Let's start with the vaccines because it's so much into the \u2013 right now, it's so much data and it's so much into the news. I think that the analysts are having, as appropriately, expectations for pneumococcal 20 as we do. But I haven't seen anyone having anything about Clostridium difficile, which is running a Phase III study and is expected to read out, I think, late this year or beginning \u2013 I think later in the year. I don't think anyone has anything about RSV that has started a pivotal study. I don't think that anybody has anything about pentavalent meningococcal that has started a pivotal study. I don't think anyone has anything about the Lyme vaccine, but it is in Phase II study and is progressing, and it is \u2013 all of that are vaccines that are \u2013 there is no basically a similar vaccine in development. You can say pneumococcal 20 has a competing pneumococcal 15. But the rest, I don't think anything like that. We have right now, together with COVID, 7 vaccines in the clinic, 7, right? Let's go now through rare diseases. I think everybody is putting some revenues on the VYNDAQEL and rightly so. But I don't think anyone is having anything about our gene therapy platform, almost nothing. And there is that one, which is the one that we're discussing recently because we had data releases like the Duchenne muscle dystrophy. There are others that are coming sooner to the market like hemophilia A or hemophilia B. And these are very, very big markets, and we're having very, very strong data, so significant probability that we will be successful. I don't think anyone is factoring anything there. And also, some smaller products, but altogether, they have a contribution like the hemophilia, the pan-hemophilia product, TFPI and also about the growth hormone. I don't think anyone is factoring anything there. When you go to internal medicines, I don't think anyone is factoring anything. And we have been able to present recently very good data from our NASH portfolio that's progressing very nicely, but also the GLP, which could be a tremendous opportunity to move, and I can go on and on. So there is a lot of standard \u2013 I think right now, people are not modeling. And that could explain why people \u2013 some of the people are maybe factoring that the 6%, I don't know, it's 4% or 5%. But I don't think anything \u2013 anywhere, when I see the analyst expectations, there's a very big discrepancy between the 6%. But I think that as we have proven to all of you and to the market our ability to execute on these studies and as we start having readouts, I think people will see it and will assign the right value. With that being said, a good way to do that, it is to have a good discussion with you during the Investor Day. And I will ask John to discuss with us what shall we expect to see that day.\nJohn Young: Thanks, Albert, and thanks for the question, Louise. So, I think, Albert has just given you some great highlights of some of the programs that \u2013 in our pipeline that we believe are potentially underappreciated and maybe haven't been as visible to the analyst community. So our goal for the Investor Day is that we really want to highlight what we are very excited about in terms of the strong capability and the productivity of our R&D organization. We're going to provide an update on each of our 5 core R&D-driven business units in our pipeline. And I think we feel this is exactly the right time to do that with the announcement of the Upjohn transaction and our pipeline, as Albert has just commented, really being stronger than it's been in years. We really do feel this is a perfect time to share the excitement about Pfizer's profile as a leading pure play innovative biopharmaceutical company. So I won't repeat the detail that Albert has gone through, but I would just say that we'll focus the day on programs that we expect to launch by 2025, 2026, programs that the analyst community are generally not currently modeling in their valuations and some programs where there's new data. So I expect that we'll be able to shed some light on several pipeline opportunities that we see as promising and certainly including some of the specific programs that Albert has mentioned.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very, very much John. And of course, also, the unique thing with this day is that we will try to also present the people behind this success. So we will give you visibility to our scientists and the commercial people that are driving each one of these units. Frank, can you please answer the question on the margin?\nFrank D'Amelio: Sure. So, let me just start with what's in the release, which is if you look at our guidance for new Pfizer, one of the things we say is 37%, we call it IBT adjusted margin. Now just to refresh everyone's memory, IBT is income before taxes. But in Pfizer, that's basically operating income, and then it includes other income because we have significant equity income coming into that line item from the consumer joint venture. So, now what that is framing the way I think about this is we grow the top line, to Albert's point, at least 6% on a CAGR basis through 2025. We will leverage that to the bottom line. So we're growing when we\u2019re growing the top-line are at least 6%, we're going to clearly have operating income that's growing at a rate that's greater than that. We also believe \u2013 I also believe there's opportunities to be more efficient in our SI&A spend so that, that 37%, what we'd like to do, what we expect to do is to see that go from 37% into the higher 30s, so 38%, 39% and then ultimately, I'd like to see that begin with a 4. That's how we think about.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, thank you, Frank. And I realized as I was trying to save some time that I didn't speak about oncology and immune inflammation in things that the analysts are not modeling and \u2013 because I may get into trouble with the people of this unit. About immune inflammation, I think a lot of analysts are modeling the abrocitinib. But I don't think that anybody is modeling all the rest of the JAK portfolio. Right now, we have 5 new molecular entities that we are trying in 10 different indications and that was by design. Our strategy was very different than the strategy of other companies that usually, they try for efficiency to select the best target and develop it for everything. What we did, we selected the best target for a specific disease because different drugs or different molecules, they respond very differently if the disease is on the skin or on the gut or on the \u2013 or if it is an arthritis. So this strategy now is about to start giving significant readouts for all the other molecules that are coming. And of course, in oncology, in addition to the work that is happening in new model CDKs and resistance to cancer from our La Jolla group, don\u2019t forget the acquisition of Array, that is the boulder, Pfizer boulder we call it right now, that they are an extremely productive group, that they are \u2013 keep providing with new leads, and we're expecting to have, in the clinic from this group, 1 to likely 2 new molecules every month. So \u2013 sorry, it was a long answer, but it's a long list. We can go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. My first one was just coming back to COVID vaccine pricing. I guess my question is, do you see this initial $19.50 per dose pricing that we saw last week as a decent proxy for pricing over time? Or should we expect price to decline here as we think about a range of potential vaccines being developed and some of your competitors have maybe different pricing strategies coming to market? And then my second question was kind of a bigger picture one here. It seems like you're running kind of an unprecedented development program with the COVID vaccines. To the extent this is successful, do you see an opportunity to apply some of these approaches to broader product development in an effort to maybe speed development time lines in areas of unmet need? I'm just trying to think here is like, is there some read across the rest of the portfolio to the extent that this study is successful? Thanks so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Chris, in the interest of time, instead of asking Angela to answer the first question \u2013 that it is \u2013 the first one that is managing. Look, it's \u2013 the price that we have said in the U.S. is the price that basically is a good benchmark for this level of volumes that people will order. If they order less, the price would be higher. If they order more, it could be a little bit lower. But this is a very good benchmark. And I don't think that this will change during the pandemic because irrelevant how many products will be \u2013 it's not irrelevant, but I assume that \u2013 and I hope that many vaccines will be registered and will make the cut. But still, the demand for 7.5 billion people will be very, very high. And so this, I think, will be maintained. As Angela said in her answer, after the pandemic, which is, after we have this significant sets of volumes, demand for volumes now, which will take us all the way to 2021, beginning maybe of 2022, obviously, we could go to a much more normal type of situation where volumes will be much more normal and the price also will be based on the competition of the time and also will be based on the value that the product brings, which is not the case right now. Obviously, it is priced well, well, well below the value that brings to society this product. And as regard to your second question, instead of also moving to Mikael about \u2013 can we use this platform? We can use this platform. Don't forget that we are working already two years for a flu vaccine by using the RNA platform. And already, Mikael spoke in his question that he sees  answer to a similar question before, that he sees multiple opportunities to use the platform in different type of diseases.\nChris Schott: Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Next question please operator.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two if I may. And perhaps first, Albert, I know Moderna's CEO said that he expects, based on his data, a 75% to 80% odds of clearing the Phase III bar set by FDA for the COVID vaccine. I'm curious\u2026\nAlbert Bourla: Say it again. I'm not sure I \u2013 can you say it again, what he said?\nUmer Raffat: Sure, Albert. So Moderna's CEO believes the odds of clearing Phase III is 75% to 80% based on the data they've produced. Are you in the same ballpark based on the data you're seeing? And one for Mikael, if I may. Mikael, in the press release last night where you decided to take the b2 vaccine construct to Phase III and not the previously published b1, what I noticed was the pivotal factor was perhaps that there were more spike-specific T cell epitopes being seen with this second construct. Can you give us a little more specifics on that? And can you also speak to the fact that several studies are suggesting about half of T cell response could actually be on epitopes, which are beyond the spike in the first place? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, thank you very much Umer. Look I don\u2019t want myself to speculate now what is the probability that I see if the product will be successful. The study started and the only one that will tell us is the data readout. But I will share the opportunity here because the data that we have seen so far are very, very, very strong. But again, there have been cases that you have very, very strong clinical data in the Phase II, and the Phase III, for some reason, doesn't work. But I think it's very high. I'm optimistic based on the data that I have seen so far, but we need to wait to see what the readout will be. And then Mikael can explain all the excellent questions that you asked.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you, Albert. So I just want to say it was a great question. And as we said, we had 2 great vaccine candidates. And in the end, the data of totality favor the b2. And the specific question around spike, yes, we detected a number of epitopes. In the spike, there's one fragment that contains RBDE but also in the S2 fragment that's outside RBDE. And we think there is a richness of T cell epitope for CD4 T cells and for CD8. I would like particularly to punctuate that the majority or the overwhelming use in the field of immunology is that to fight against viruses with immune system, you need neutralizing antibodies when the virus is outside the cell, but you need CD8 T cells to kill viral containing cells when the virus is hiding in the cell. And that was really part of our full platform. And it's not just related to spike. It's related to how you construct the envelope, the lipid nanoparticles and how you modify the RNA. And we spent several years to get into that goal that's been associated, over a long time a successful way of preventing viral infection by vaccination. And I think we're on to something really unique in our platform here with that dual way of combating the infection. And of course, it also was related to really good tolerability, low dose, nice immune response in older and younger. So all of that, of course, gives us a lot of encouragement for moving forward here.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much and congrats on all of the positive update. So I have two questions on the COVID vaccine. First, should we expect to see primate data in coming weeks, which provide information on the durability of your vaccine after the second dose? The reason why I ask is, obviously, there's a need for a booster just 30 days after the first dose. So it would be helpful to better understand how durable the efficacy is post the second dose. And second, with respect to your arrangements that you're \u2013 that you booked with the U.S government and that you planned to arrange with ex U.S. governments and entities, could you just discuss Pfizer's COVID vaccine liability shield expectation specifically what the U.S. government can protect you against in the event that there are surprising adverse events down the line and then what you can arrange with ex U.S. entities? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Now, thank you, Dave. Very good questions, both of them. Mikael, can you please answer the question about when we can expect primate data, the durability? And by the way, our \u2013 Dave, our booster is coming 21 days after the first dose. And then I will ask Doug Lankler to comment on the liabilities.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, thank you, Albert. Yes, the primate data, I think, have two key components. One is that we were able to show that there is no signs of any augmentation of a negative effect on disease outcome. On the contrary, we were able to show that our b1 and b2 were able to prevent disease in airways, including lung and also nose and that b2 was very effective in this, suggesting that we can protect the individuals that will be exposed to the virus and possibly, as it needs to be confirmed in humans, also reduce the risk of spreading the virus. It still will be a bit too early to have a lot of data on durability. We are following it in animals and in humans. And we have seen so far that the neutralizing antibodies actually tend to rise even though the total number of antibodies tend to stabilize at some level. And that suggests that we actually continue to evolve a new response with more potent binding antibodies. I want to just also add that when it comes to durability, Dave, if you look in the literature, in general, antibody durability after vaccination can last quite some time. But the really long-lasting durability is in the T cell compartment. And for viral disease, particularly CD8-positive cytotoxic cells, they have been detected ten years or more after SARS-CoV-1. And then finally, while we will monitor durability, of course, in the human study for several years, our platform has the advantage that we can easily boost at an appropriate time point with no anti-vector immunity and we are likely to build those antibodies and T cells. And that's, of course, different from a lot of adenovirus platforms that have difficulty to boost even one time. And we tried all of the platforms, whether viral platforms, protein-based and mRNA and for a pandemic of this, we selected a construct based on a large number of knowledge and experience cross platform and cross constant. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Doug?\nDoug Lankler: Yes, thanks. In the U.S., we expect the PREP Act and the Vaccine Act are going to provide Pfizer broad protections against any personal injury claims that might come out of any type of problems from the vaccine or side effects or otherwise. We\u2019re pursuing similar liability protections outside of the United States through contractual and/or legislative efforts, and we believe this is going to be manageable.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Doug.\nChuck Triano: Doug. And operator, if we can take our last question please and then we will have a closing comment from Albert. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a follow up on the COVID pivotal trial over the next few months, could you clarify what you'll be telling us and when and then how that will affect the blinding and ultimately getting the full safety data for a full approval? It sounds as though, as we all know, you're going to get the number of events pretty quickly. So will you communicate when the study is enrolled? Will you communicate the efficacy results at the interim to the extent that you hit the statistical endpoint? And then again, what effect will that have on the full safety data that presumably you still need to get to achieve full approval? Thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Just for the interest of time, Geoff, obviously, if we hit, in an interim approval, an effective \u2013 the effectiveness endpoint, we will certainly communicate that. And then I'm not sure right now if we will provide regular updates as to how many have enrolled and when the enrollment is completed. As Mikael said, it's going to be a very rapid enrollment anyway. So we plan by the end of August to have enrolled the majority of our 30,000 patients. And then the results could come, depends on the efficacy of the vaccine and depends also on the burden of the disease. From September to October, this is the current assumptions. And with that, we will make it known. Obviously, we have done in the past ways that we can unblind data for FDA, and we can still maintain the blindness when the studies are continued because the studies anyway are planned to continue for 2 years that we are going to be monitoring our patients. So that's what I can give you right now.\nAlbert Bourla: Let me then thank you all for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. I really enjoyed this earnings call, very strong operational performance. So very, very few questions on products and a lot of questions that dominated the call on our pipeline, of course, with, number one, COVID-19 because this is a tremendous opportunity for the world to be able to bring an effective and safe vaccine. As you have heard, our key in-market medicines remain strong, our pipeline remain robust and we remain fully confident in the potential of the long-term growth strategy to yield at least 6% CAGR through 2025 following the completion of the pending Upjohn/Mylan combination. We discussed a lot about our hard work to combat COVID-19, and we have been very encouraged by the early data of our mRNA-based vaccine program with BioNTech. My heartfelt thanks go out to all the colleagues at both companies who are working tirelessly to find medical solutions to this global pandemic. And because of their efforts, I'm confident to say that science will win. Have a rest of the day \u2013 a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss our second quarter business performance, provide an update our pipeline and, of course, speak to the progress we are making to combat the global public health challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our continued strong performance speaks to the resilience of our business, even during the most challenging times. The second quarter was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19. Revenues in the quarter included an estimated net unfavorable impact of approximately $500 million, or 4% due to COVID-19, primarily reflecting unfavorable disruption to wellness visits for pediatric and declines in adult patients in the U.S. and lower demand for certain products in China. These declines were partially offset by increased U.S. demand for certain Sterile Injectable products, increased adult demand for Prevnar 13 in certain international markets. Let me start with an update on our biopharmaceuticals group. For the quarter, our Biopharma business grew 6% operationally, driven by strong performances from many of our key growth drivers, including Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Ibrance, Inlyta, Xtandi and our biosimilars portfolio. Our oncology business was particularly strong, up 20% operationally compared with a year ago quarter. Global Ibrance revenues increased 9% operationally to $1.3 billion during the quarter. In the U.S. Ibrance revenues grew 11% and Ibrance continues to retain a strong leadership position within the CDK class. The international markets delivered strong 18% volume growth in the quarter. This volume growth was partially offset by price reductions in certain EU markets, which resulted in 3% operational revenue growth outside in the U.S. The price reductions occurred last year as a result of renegotiating long-term agreements and we expect the impact will continue through to the fourth quarter of 2020 when the price changes annualize. Thank you, Steve. Frank, why don't you take the first question? And maybe, Angela, also you can chime in and then if \u2013 Mikael will answer the COVID question. Frank? Angela? Mikael? Thank you, Mikael. And Steve, I can't resist also adding that as you are looking at new Pfizer, what we are trying to build, a much more science-focused Pfizer, you will see three themes: excellence in execution, speed and agility. And you will see that across commercial with the results that you see; across R&D with our ability to advance a program like COVID, very complicated, in such a speed; and across manufacturing, where in the middle of a pandemic, we maintain all our operational units up and running. And we experienced virtually very, very little stock disruptions in a period that demand for some injectables went five, four, six times up. Please go to the next question. Yes. Let me answer the first one and then Mikael will speak about the PALACE. The answer is absolutely. It is not 6%, it is at least 6% and that we reiterate and we feel much stronger right now. And that excludes obviously any impact of COVID on the top line. And as I explained multiple times in investor events, the reason why our approximately 6% went to at least 6% while we lost PALACE was because for PALACE, we had $2 billion of revenues in our projections at 50% probability of success, so we lost $1 billion. But at the same time, since we had given the 6%, we advanced \u2013 we had successful Phase 3 study in adults, pneumococcal. We have successful POCs in multiple vaccines, which we advanced already right now to Phase 3. Three vaccines, as I spoke, we advanced in Phase III. We have Duchenne muscle dystrophy, positive POC. We have a lot of positive news that when we update the probability of success in our model, more than offset the PALACE. And with that, I want to ask Mikael to comment on why he thinks PALACE failed. Thank you, Angela. Let's go to the next question, please. Yes. On the first question, Mikael can speak, but also, I think Angela can add how we see this evolution. So \u2013 and then I will answer the second one. Mikael? Thank you, Angela. And thank you Mikael. That was very comprehensive, I think. Now as regards to the executive order, as I said, obviously, I was very disappointed to see those orders coming because I feel that they are coming at a period of time that this is not what is needed. This is a period of time that our scientists are working to develop a vaccine or a treatment, and our manufacturing workers are working day and night to maintain, under COVID conditions, supply of medicines and also provide additional supplies for this vaccine. They should worry only about how to defeat this virus and how to maintain the supply and should not start worrying about their jobs. I think the timing was wrong. And I believe that there is a need for a dialogue so that we can move forward, like look backwards. But clearly, there is a need for \u2013 on the technical level first, to be an agreement. I don't think there is a need for, right now, for White House meetings. There is a need for people that they understand the topics from both sides, work to find solutions how we can decrease the contribution \u2013 how can we decrease the out-of-pocket expense of the Americans that has gone to levels that they are unacceptable right now. This is the real problem and this is what we see that we need to reform. Thank you. Next question, please, operator. Yes. Thank you. Very good questions, both of them. In our M&A strategy, nothing has changed. It is exactly what we have defined. We are in the street to be aggressive and deploy capital to license in or acquire early to mid-stage aggressive and deploy capital to license in or acquire early to mid-stage clinical projects that could become medicines in the years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, and then they can start picking their sales so that we can maintain post-2026 the 6% growth. And that has not changed. We never say never to anything, particularly if people are asking if we want to do a big acquisition. We never say never to anything. And by the way, our firepower allow us to do vertically \u2013 virtually anything that we could decide. But our strategic direction is clear, laser-focused on this area so that we can maintain the growth. And we did have significant achievements in that front. I will mention to you the last two vaccines that we licensed in, which is the Lyme vaccine a few months ago and the COVID vaccine in our agreement with BioNTech. What was the second question? Yes. Why don't I let Angela answer the question on the U.S. pricing of the vaccine? Yes. And I want to emphasize what Angela said in her statement that no country in the developed world, which means Europe, Japan, all the countries that are developed right now, will not receive a lower price for the same volume commitment than the U.S. But that, of course, excludes African countries or other countries that they don't have the means to pay over there. We may do exceptions and offer it to lower price. Thank you very much, Angela. Let's go to the next question. Frank, go ahead, please. Thank you very, very much, Frank. And Mikael, can you speak a little bit about our study design, the powering assumptions, interim analysis, et cetera. Thank you very much, Mikael. And again, we said it very clearly in our press release. The study design has been discussed extensively with FDA, and we are following all the guidelines that FDA has put out there. And that should be the golden standard for anyone who is doing studies for COVID-19. We can go to the next question. I will answer the 6%, and then I will ask John Young to speak a little bit what you should expect during the R&D Day. And then obviously, Frank can speak about the margin expansions. Now, as I said, the 6% CAGR, we feel very, very strongly about it. And I don't think that the time horizon on this call will allow me to speak about the entry that we have in our models that I don't see, frankly, in most of the analyst expectations, but let me try. Let's start with the vaccines because it's so much into the \u2013 right now, it's so much data and it's so much into the news. I think that the analysts are having, as appropriately, expectations for pneumococcal 20 as we do. But I haven't seen anyone having anything about Clostridium difficile, which is running a Phase III study and is expected to read out, I think, late this year or beginning \u2013 I think later in the year. I don't think anyone has anything about RSV that has started a pivotal study. I don't think that anybody has anything about pentavalent meningococcal that has started a pivotal study. I don't think anyone has anything about the Lyme vaccine, but it is in Phase II study and is progressing, and it is \u2013 all of that are vaccines that are \u2013 there is no basically a similar vaccine in development. You can say pneumococcal 20 has a competing pneumococcal 15. But the rest, I don't think anything like that. We have right now, together with COVID, 7 vaccines in the clinic, 7, right? Let's go now through rare diseases. I think everybody is putting some revenues on the VYNDAQEL and rightly so. But I don't think anyone is having anything about our gene therapy platform, almost nothing. And there is that one, which is the one that we're discussing recently because we had data releases like the Duchenne muscle dystrophy. There are others that are coming sooner to the market like hemophilia A or hemophilia B. And these are very, very big markets, and we're having very, very strong data, so significant probability that we will be successful. I don't think anyone is factoring anything there. And also, some smaller products, but altogether, they have a contribution like the hemophilia, the pan-hemophilia product, TFPI and also about the growth hormone. I don't think anyone is factoring anything there. When you go to internal medicines, I don't think anyone is factoring anything. And we have been able to present recently very good data from our NASH portfolio that's progressing very nicely, but also the GLP, which could be a tremendous opportunity to move, and I can go on and on. So there is a lot of standard \u2013 I think right now, people are not modeling. And that could explain why people \u2013 some of the people are maybe factoring that the 6%, I don't know, it's 4% or 5%. But I don't think anything \u2013 anywhere, when I see the analyst expectations, there's a very big discrepancy between the 6%. But I think that as we have proven to all of you and to the market our ability to execute on these studies and as we start having readouts, I think people will see it and will assign the right value. With that being said, a good way to do that, it is to have a good discussion with you during the Investor Day. And I will ask John to discuss with us what shall we expect to see that day. Thank you very, very much John. And of course, also, the unique thing with this day is that we will try to also present the people behind this success. So we will give you visibility to our scientists and the commercial people that are driving each one of these units. Frank, can you please answer the question on the margin? Yes, thank you, Frank. And I realized as I was trying to save some time that I didn't speak about oncology and immune inflammation in things that the analysts are not modeling and \u2013 because I may get into trouble with the people of this unit. About immune inflammation, I think a lot of analysts are modeling the abrocitinib. But I don't think that anybody is modeling all the rest of the JAK portfolio. Right now, we have 5 new molecular entities that we are trying in 10 different indications and that was by design. Our strategy was very different than the strategy of other companies that usually, they try for efficiency to select the best target and develop it for everything. What we did, we selected the best target for a specific disease because different drugs or different molecules, they respond very differently if the disease is on the skin or on the gut or on the \u2013 or if it is an arthritis. So this strategy now is about to start giving significant readouts for all the other molecules that are coming. And of course, in oncology, in addition to the work that is happening in new model CDKs and resistance to cancer from our La Jolla group, don't forget the acquisition of Array, that is the boulder, Pfizer boulder we call it right now, that they are an extremely productive group, that they are \u2013 keep providing with new leads, and we're expecting to have, in the clinic from this group, 1 to likely 2 new molecules every month. So \u2013 sorry, it was a long answer, but it's a long list. We can go to the next question. Chris, in the interest of time, instead of asking Angela to answer the first question \u2013 that it is \u2013 the first one that is managing. Look, it's \u2013 the price that we have said in the U.S. is the price that basically is a good benchmark for this level of volumes that people will order. If they order less, the price would be higher. If they order more, it could be a little bit lower. But this is a very good benchmark. And I don't think that this will change during the pandemic because irrelevant how many products will be \u2013 it's not irrelevant, but I assume that \u2013 and I hope that many vaccines will be registered and will make the cut. But still, the demand for 7.5 billion people will be very, very high. And so this, I think, will be maintained. As Angela said in her answer, after the pandemic, which is, after we have this significant sets of volumes, demand for volumes now, which will take us all the way to 2021, beginning maybe of 2022, obviously, we could go to a much more normal type of situation where volumes will be much more normal and the price also will be based on the competition of the time and also will be based on the value that the product brings, which is not the case right now. Obviously, it is priced well, well, well below the value that brings to society this product. And as regard to your second question, instead of also moving to Mikael about \u2013 can we use this platform? We can use this platform. Don't forget that we are working already two years for a flu vaccine by using the RNA platform. And already, Mikael spoke in his question that he sees  answer to a similar question before, that he sees multiple opportunities to use the platform in different type of diseases. Next question please operator. Say it again. I'm not sure I \u2013 can you say it again, what he said? Yes, thank you very much Umer. Look I don't want myself to speculate now what is the probability that I see if the product will be successful. The study started and the only one that will tell us is the data readout. But I will share the opportunity here because the data that we have seen so far are very, very, very strong. But again, there have been cases that you have very, very strong clinical data in the Phase II, and the Phase III, for some reason, doesn't work. But I think it's very high. I'm optimistic based on the data that I have seen so far, but we need to wait to see what the readout will be. And then Mikael can explain all the excellent questions that you asked. Thank you. Next question please. Now, thank you, Dave. Very good questions, both of them. Mikael, can you please answer the question about when we can expect primate data, the durability? And by the way, our \u2013 Dave, our booster is coming 21 days after the first dose. And then I will ask Doug Lankler to comment on the liabilities. Thank you, Mikael. Doug? Thank you very much, Doug. Yes. Just for the interest of time, Geoff, obviously, if we hit, in an interim approval, an effective \u2013 the effectiveness endpoint, we will certainly communicate that. And then I'm not sure right now if we will provide regular updates as to how many have enrolled and when the enrollment is completed. As Mikael said, it's going to be a very rapid enrollment anyway. So we plan by the end of August to have enrolled the majority of our 30,000 patients. And then the results could come, depends on the efficacy of the vaccine and depends also on the burden of the disease. From September to October, this is the current assumptions. And with that, we will make it known. Obviously, we have done in the past ways that we can unblind data for FDA, and we can still maintain the blindness when the studies are continued because the studies anyway are planned to continue for 2 years that we are going to be monitoring our patients. So that's what I can give you right now. Let me then thank you all for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. I really enjoyed this earnings call, very strong operational performance. So very, very few questions on products and a lot of questions that dominated the call on our pipeline, of course, with, number one, COVID-19 because this is a tremendous opportunity for the world to be able to bring an effective and safe vaccine. As you have heard, our key in-market medicines remain strong, our pipeline remain robust and we remain fully confident in the potential of the long-term growth strategy to yield at least 6% CAGR through 2025 following the completion of the pending Upjohn/Mylan combination. We discussed a lot about our hard work to combat COVID-19, and we have been very encouraged by the early data of our mRNA-based vaccine program with BioNTech. My heartfelt thanks go out to all the colleagues at both companies who are working tirelessly to find medical solutions to this global pandemic. And because of their efforts, I'm confident to say that science will win. Have a rest of the day \u2013 a great rest of your day."

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Yes, thank you for the question. We are very pleased with our \u2013 both actually the b1 and the b2 vaccine candidate. And as we know, we have selected b2 and now started dosing of patients in a late stage trial. We have started b2 in near 120 patients in the Phase 1. And for the specific questions on the older adults, we were very pleased with the safety and tolerability seen in older adults after both the first injection and the boost. In general, mild to moderate reactions whether locally or systemic and overall, a very stable tolerability profile. We also reported neutralizing antibodies after the boost, day 28, that exceeded a panel of convalescent plasma, which was very rewarding to see. Finally, I want to punctuate that in addition to neutralizing antibodies, our mRNA vaccine also elicits potent antiviral T cell activation, including CD8 T cells that have been implied as key cellular mediator to control viral infection, including coronaviruses. Yes, thank you for the question. We are now analyzing data and details, looking at various sub looking at various sub-analysis and sensitivities. So it's still too early to have a view on what made this study not successful. And as Albert alluded to, IBRANCE has been and is a very strong brand in the metastatic setting. It has a favorable tolerability profile and is supported by a number of randomized controlled clinical studies. And I wanted to just add that real-world data studies have also replicated a progression-free survival and added overall survival data using real-world evidence for IBRANCE in the metastatic setting. Now we'll continue to share with you the learnings we have. And of course, we have the PENELOPE-B study to read out, which we can't comment on. It includes a different patient type than in PALACE. Yes. Thank you for the question. Of course, there is a lot of unknown here with a disease that has just been known to the medical community for maybe six months. But we have seen a dramatic expansion of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 across the globe, including appearance of new variants. So we look upon it as in two phases. The first one is the pandemic phase where, of course, coming with a safe, high-quality efficacious vaccine soon is important. And that's why we are so pleased to be able to announce, as we did yesterday, dosing of patients in our pivotal trial. And for that, a two-shot vaccine is likely to give a protection if successful in the clinical study based on both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated, the CD8 T cells that seems to be important in protection against viruses.  Considering the \u2013 beyond the pandemic phase, which may likely, at the global level, last a few years, it is hard to be certain about the future. But I do think there are scenarios which are very reasonable and we need to be prepared for, that COVID-19 has established itself as a prominent virus, as much circulating in society as flu. And as we will understand the \u2013 how long-lasting the various vaccines are, it will allow us to better predict how often one should consider to reimmunize. A platform such as mRNA has the advantage that there is no anti-vector immunity and if needed, you could immunize annually every two years, every four years. And I just wanted to add that beyond being a very important pillar in the future defense against COVID-19 and probably reasonable to assume that there will be other coronaviruses, as we have seen how they have accumulated in a recombined form in many different species, but this platform will be possible to also disrupt platform will be possible to also disrupt the flu market, novel vaccines against CMV and even to go into a novel age group of RSV. So we see a very large opportunity based on the leadership we have with this mRNA platform, particularly by being able to engage both neutralizing antibodies and antiviral CD8 cells. Angela? Yes. Thank you for the question. So we started dosing yesterday in which will be 30,000 healthy adults aged 18 to 85. We have more than 30 states in U.S. picked in areas that will contribute to both enrollment as well as event rate, and that is supplemented by South America and Europe sites. When it comes to how the study will be executed, it is currently assumed that we will have sufficient number of individuals enrolled by early September to allow several interim analysis to support potential filing that could start in September or in October, depending on event rates as well as vaccine efficacy. And at this time point, I think I don't want to give more details. The primary endpoint is efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 in participants without evidence of infection before vaccination as well as efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 in participants with and without evidence of infection before vaccination. And we use PCR technology to confirm infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as using antibody tests to confirm previous exposure. So all in all, it's well-powered study to detect a meaningful vaccine efficacy, and interim analysis would lead to opportunity to start planning for filing from September running into October. And this is, of course, pending our assumptions on event rate. I want to say that our assumptions were made a few weeks ago, looking at incidence of disease in U.S. and elsewhere. And over the last few weeks, unfortunately, the incidence rate has made the disease even more prevalent. So if anything, we would expect on that planning to be able to hit event rates sooner rather than later, which is, of course, favorable for a potential filing of this vaccine September to October time frame. Yes. Thank you, Albert. So I just want to say it was a great question. And as we said, we had 2 great vaccine candidates. And in the end, the data of totality favor the b2. And the specific question around spike, yes, we detected a number of epitopes. In the spike, there's one fragment that contains RBDE but also in the S2 fragment that's outside RBDE. And we think there is a richness of T cell epitope for CD4 T cells and for CD8. I would like particularly to punctuate that the majority or the overwhelming use in the field of immunology is that to fight against viruses with immune system, you need neutralizing antibodies when the virus is outside the cell, but you need CD8 T cells to kill viral containing cells when the virus is hiding in the cell. And that was really part of our full platform. And it's not just related to spike. It's related to how you construct the envelope, the lipid nanoparticles and how you modify the RNA. And we spent several years to get into that goal that's been associated, over a long time a successful way of preventing viral infection by vaccination. And I think we're on to something really unique in our platform here with that dual way of combating the infection. And of course, it also was related to really good tolerability, low dose, nice immune response in older and younger. So all of that, of course, gives us a lot of encouragement for moving forward here. Yes, thank you, Albert. Yes, the primate data, I think, have two key components. One is that we were able to show that there is no signs of any augmentation of a negative effect on disease outcome. On the contrary, we were able to show that our b1 and b2 were able to prevent disease in airways, including lung and also nose and that b2 was very effective in this, suggesting that we can protect the individuals that will be exposed to the virus and possibly, as it needs to be confirmed in humans, also reduce the risk of spreading the virus. It still will be a bit too early to have a lot of data on durability. We are following it in animals and in humans. And we have seen so far that the neutralizing antibodies actually tend to rise even though the total number of antibodies tend to stabilize at some level. And that suggests that we actually continue to evolve a new response with more potent binding antibodies. I want to just also add that when it comes to durability, Dave, if you look in the literature, in general, antibody durability after vaccination can last quite some time. But the really long-lasting durability is in the T cell compartment. And for viral disease, particularly CD8-positive cytotoxic cells, they have been detected ten years or more after SARS-CoV-1. And then finally, while we will monitor durability, of course, in the human study for several years, our platform has the advantage that we can easily boost at an appropriate time point with no anti-vector immunity and we are likely to build those antibodies and T cells. And that's, of course, different from a lot of adenovirus platforms that have difficulty to boost even one time. And we tried all of the platforms, whether viral platforms, protein-based and mRNA and for a pandemic of this, we selected a construct based on a large number of knowledge and experience cross platform and cross constant. Thank you."

            "name": "Frank D'Amelio",
            "content": "Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. Starting with total company revenue, we generated $11.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020, down 9% operationally versus the year ago quarter. As in each of the last three quarters, the majority of this decline is due to the fact that we no longer report revenues for our Consumer Healthcare business. Adjusting for Consumer, total company revenues declined 3% operationally. As a reminder, the formation of the Consumer joint venture with GSK will annualize on July 31, so next quarter will be the last one impacted by this negative driver. Albert did a really nice job of describing the revenue drivers for each of our businesses so I won't repeat them, but I do want to make one additional point on each business to punctuate what he said. For Biopharma, the growth that we are seeing is not reliant on net price increases. In fact, on a global basis, net price had a negative 2% impact on Biopharma growth this quarter and in the U.S., net price was flat. These dynamics are consistent with the pricing environment we have seen for several years now, and we continue to believe that pricing will not contribute to our expected growth for the foreseeable future. For Upjohn, it is important to point out that despite a 31% operational decline in revenue this quarter, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations and the assumptions reflected in our initial Upjohn guidance. I should also point out that the 31% becomes minus 6%, excluding the impact of the Lyrica LOE. Now moving down the income statement, we had another quarter with significant declines in adjusted SI&A expenses, which were down 17% operationally. Nearly half of that decline was due to the fact that we no longer report expenses for the Consumer Healthcare business. The remainder of the decrease was driven primarily by decreased sales and marketing activities compared to the prior year quarter due to restrictions on in-person meetings with health care professionals primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, lower spending associated with corporate enabling functions. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was down significantly compared to the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by a onetime favorable tax settlement recorded in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was down 2% compared to the prior year second quarter. Excluding the $0.02 negative impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, adjusted diluted EPS was flat compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange also negatively impacted revenues in the quarter by $277 million or 2%. On Slide 13, we are providing an update to the detailed assumptions reflected in our current financial guidance related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Broadly speaking, we anticipate an ongoing gradual global recovery from the macroeconomic and health care impacts experienced during the second quarter of 2020 beginning in Q3 of 2020. The guidance also assumes we'll be able to continue to operate our manufacturing and supply chain without material disruption and that we will continue investing in potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 throughout 2020 but does not include any revenues for a COVID-19 vaccine candidate given that it has not yet been approved. With that in mind, let's take a look at our guidance. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance. Beginning with total company, we are raising our guidance range for revenues by $100 million and our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 based on the strength and resiliency we see in our business and the dedication of our colleagues despite the challenges inherent in operating during this current global pandemic. We are reaffirming all of the components of our 2020 financial guidance for total company. I want to point out that although changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-April have marginally benefited our full year outlook for revenue and adjusted diluted EPS, today's guidance increases are not primarily driven by changes in foreign exchange. And as a reminder, we maintained both of these guidance ranges last quarter despite absorbing much larger negative impacts from foreign exchange. Moving on to financial guidance for new Pfizer and Upjohn. Both of the changes we made for total Pfizer guidance this quarter are reflected in the updates you see here to our new Pfizer financial guidance. On the Upjohn side, all financial guidance components are being reaffirmed, reflecting that the performance of that business continues to track in line with our expectations. Moving on to key takeaways. In the second quarter, our company performed well, driven by the strong 6% operational revenue growth from our Biopharma business. We raised our 2020 total company and new Pfizer guidance ranges for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS, and we reaffirmed all of the components of our financial guidance, including all guidance ranges for our Upjohn business. We raised sufficient funding through our Upjohn subsidiary to satisfy the $12 billion dividend to be paid to Pfizer upon the close of the combination of Upjohn with Mylan, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter. We also achieved multiple product and pipeline milestones since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here. A more complete listing can be found in this morning's press release. Finally, we paid $4.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders in the first half of this year. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck. Sure. Good morning, Steve. So Steve, obviously, I can't comment on what some of our competitors printed for the quarter. But obviously, we had a strong quarter, and I think I can attribute it to, quite frankly, the excellent execution that we continue to deliver. If you look at the Biopharma business, really strong strength across the portfolio, 6% operational growth, about $600 million in revenue, VYNDAQEL \u2013 I'm rounding the numbers. VYNDAQEL was up $200 million, Eliquis was up $200 million, IBRANCE was up $100 million, Inlyta was up $100 million, so really, really strong performance. And by the way, overall, that's despite $500 million hit to revenue from COVID, $400 million of which was in our Biopharma business. Then if you look at our spending, I think we've done a nice job on managing our spending. Obviously, we're getting some help from COVID, but if you look at the rest of the business, we continue to be disciplined on how we spend money. So I think all in, I think we're continuing to execute in a very effective way. Yes. So Terence, you're absolutely right. We talked about a gradual recovery in the quarter. And we're saying that in terms of patient visits to doctors, vaccination rates, elective surgeries, where we're expecting a gradual increase, a gradual improvement over Q2 levels beginning in Q3. Same thing with new-to-brand prescriptions, where we're expecting a gradual improvement over 2Q levels beginning in Q3. And then in the U.S., just a gradual improvement in terms of our reps visiting and getting to meet face-to-face with health care professionals. So it's definitely a gradual improvement. That's an update from the language we put into Q1, and most importantly, all of which we have factored into the latest guidance that we provided to you all today for 2020. And that includes total company, new Pfizer and the Upjohn guidance that we provided. Sure. So, let me just start with what's in the release, which is if you look at our guidance for new Pfizer, one of the things we say is 37%, we call it IBT adjusted margin. Now just to refresh everyone's memory, IBT is income before taxes. But in Pfizer, that's basically operating income, and then it includes other income because we have significant equity income coming into that line item from the consumer joint venture. So, now what that is framing the way I think about this is we grow the top line, to Albert's point, at least 6% on a CAGR basis through 2025. We will leverage that to the bottom line. So we're growing when we're growing the top-line are at least 6%, we're going to clearly have operating income that's growing at a rate that's greater than that. We also believe \u2013 I also believe there's opportunities to be more efficient in our SI&A spend so that, that 37%, what we'd like to do, what we expect to do is to see that go from 37% into the higher 30s, so 38%, 39% and then ultimately, I'd like to see that begin with a 4. That's how we think about."

In the U.S., we expect the PREP Act and the Vaccine Act are going to provide Pfizer broad protections against any personal injury claims that might come out of any type of problems from the vaccine or side effects or otherwise. We're pursuing similar liability protections outside of the United States through contractual and/or legislative efforts, and we believe this is going to be manageable."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Sure. Just to build up what Frank said, I think in addition to the execution, which was a critical element of this, we also have a product portfolio, which, in combination, really worked well together. As you said, there are parts of our portfolio that are similar to others, but this particular collection of disease areas is quite unique. You have oncology and our internal medicine, cardiology business that did not have \u2013 didn't feel and didn't experience the kind of downturn in new Rxs unlike some other portfolios. You had the hospital BU that pulled through. You had portfolios that are very much about continuing patients, the large base of patients that are continuing with their medicine. So I think that it really speaks to the strength and the diversity of this portfolio and the unique attributes that make it very resilient in a time like this. Sure. Thanks, Chuck. Actually, we continue to see great opportunities in the metastatic indication for IBRANCE. As you can tell, we are firmly entrenched as a leader in metastatic. And even recent research that we conducted with our prescribers, our physician prescribers indicate that they see early treatment, so the early indication as well as metastatic indication quite differently, and that what is being within each of these indications will have their own role. So when you look at our market share, both in terms of in-line as well as across all the lines, after five years in the market, IBRANCE has consistently had dominant market share. So we come into this with a \u2013 with confidence in owning metastatic. But I think it's also important to remember the experience and the confidence that both prescribers and patients have in this \u2013 the metastatic disease that has been established through time. And to build off of what Mikael said, we do have overall survival benefit. And we saw that in our real-world studies, and we're the only CDK inhibitor that has these real-world studies. And certainly, these studies will further strengthen our leadership in metastatic. So I think on all accounts, when we look at where we are, the real-world data that we've generated, the experience as well as new data and new studies that are ongoing that demonstrate that patients can be retreated. So therefore, if you have already treated a patient early, you can \u2013 with a different CDK, you can certainly retreat them again when they become metastatic with something like an IBRANCE. And so on all accounts, we continue to be very bullish about our position with IBRANCE in metastatic cancer, metastatic breast cancer. Thank you. So picking up on your \u2013 the points about the two phases. Some additional comments on these two phases. I think when it comes to the pandemic phase, we're thinking about it from the perspective of the fact that it could last until the end of 2021 or into 2022 where high volumes of doses will need to be provided for mass vaccinations to mass vaccinations to take place, right? And so I think in this pandemic period, the way that we're thinking about it, and as you've seen, is that we're pricing the vaccine for broad access. Broad access is our main goal and making sure that we can supply it to multiple governments around the world. After that, the next phase is a phase where we think it will become more standard, more seasonal, as you've described it, I think, where we anticipate that we will have to have continued vaccination for a number of years. And this is going to be important to create and maintain the herd immunity globally. So in this time period, we anticipate to return to more regular supply channels and a more value-based pricing approach. So a combination of both of these two is how we see the next many years playing out. The pricing strategy for our vaccines is universal across the board. And it is based on volumes, advanced commitments, equity and affordability principles. So this agreement in the U.S. that you referred to relates to the first 100 million doses for which Pfizer will receive $1.95 billion, and this is assuming the regulatory approval or authorization. And if the government would like to purchase an additional 500 million doses, it would be at that same price and it's also subject to future mutual agreements. Switching over to the EU or ex U.S., I think, was your other question, how we're thinking about that. Again, we're using the same pricing principles across the globe. And specifically, I won't be able And specifically, I won't be able to disclose to you the content of those confidential discussions. But again, the principles are the same. And because of that, no country in the developed world will receive doses at a lower price than the U.S. for similar volume commitments."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nChuck Triano: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2020 financial results, our reaffirmed full year 2020 financial guidance, Pfizer's role in helping find solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other relevant business topics.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the first quarter business performance as well as recent milestones from our pipeline. However, I want to start with a few thoughts about the COVID-19 pandemic and Pfizer's role in helping find solution. It goes without saying that this is an extraordinarily, difficult and unprecedented time for everyone. The public health challenges posed by COVID-19 have impacted almost every aspect of our lives. As one of the world's largest biopharmaceuticals companies, our role in this crisis is dual. On the one hand, we are focused on maintaining the continuous supply of our medicines and vaccines to patients around the globe, while protecting the safety and wellbeing of all our colleagues of course. On the other hand, we are working with experts, both within and outside Pfizer to bring our expertise, capital and resources to help contribute potential medical solutions to this pandemic. Let me share a few examples of what we are doing on this front. With the burden on hospitals happening around the globe and expected to increase, the continued supply of our medicines and vaccines is now more critical than ever. I'm pleased to say that the Pfizer global supply team has done an outstanding job, keeping our manufacturing sites and related distribution channels operational, without significant supply disruptions. In terms of finding medical solutions for the pandemic, we are collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential novel approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19. We aim to leave no stone unturned and we have made advances on multiple fronts. Regarding prevention, we recently announced that Pfizer and the German biotech company, BioNTech have entered into a global collaboration agreement to co-develop the potential first-in-class mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. Last week, we received the regulatory approval from German authority Paul-Ehrlich-Institut to commence the first clinical trial for our COVID-19 vaccine candidates in Germany and the first patient has already been dosed.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the current global pandemic, which is impacting nearly every industry around the world. Despite the challenges inherent in operating in this environment, the fundamentals of our business continue to be strong and our outlook for the future of the Company remains bright. We continue to have a strong balance sheet and favorable credit rating, which we expect to allow us to access the capital markets as needed, which was demonstrated in late March with the issuance of a $1.25 billion sustainability bond, the first of its kind in our industry. On the supply side, all 49 of our manufacturing facilities remain operational, and we have not seen a significant disruption in our supply chain as a result of the pandemic. To ensure the safety of our manufacturing colleagues while they perform this critical work, we have put in place enhanced safety measures at all of our plants, including investing in protective equipment, staggering shifts so that fewer colleagues are present at once, restricting site access to only essential workers and requiring colleagues to log their contacts while on site. I want to acknowledge how proud I am of the way our colleagues, many of whom are on the frontlines in this fight, have responded to this crisis with courage and passion from those who are working around the clock on potential treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 to those who continue to operate on manufacturing and supply chain to ensure patients can have the medicines they need. This is in times like these that the strength of our culture and of our people really shines. Now, onto the financials. First quarter 2020 revenues were $12 billion, down 7% operationally versus the year ago quarter. Of course, most of this decline is due to the fact that we no longer report revenues for our consumer healthcare business. Excluding this impact, revenues were down 1% operationally. As Albert already explained in detail, our biopharma revenues grew 12% operationally this quarter, driven by strength across multiple products with approximately 1 percentage point of that growth attributable to the net impact of COVID-19 on product sales. Upjohn revenues declined 37% operationally, driven by generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. and declining sales of Lipitor and Norvasc in China due to implementation and nationwide expansion of the volume-based procurement program. Importantly, both of these negative drivers were anticipated in our previous Upjohn guidance. For total Company, adjusted SI&A expenses in the quarter were down 16% operationally, approximately half of that decline was due to the fact that we no longer report expenses for the consumer healthcare business. The remainder of the decrease was driven by reductions in field force, advertising and promotional expenses, due to the LOE of Lyrica in the U.S. and lowest selling expenses for Lipitor and Norvasc in China, due to volume based procurement, as well as lower indirect SI&A spending associated with corporate-enabling functions. Both reported and adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter were down compared to the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues, mainly driven by the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in the U.S., partially offset by lower SI&A expenses. Finally, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $134 million or 1% on first quarter 2020 revenues and $0.02 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year-ago quarter. Before walking you through our guidance updates in detail, I want to acknowledge that no one currently knows exactly how and in what timeframe the COVID-19 pandemic will progress and eventually come to its resolution. Given those uncertainties along with our desire to be as transparent as possible, we are providing on this chart the key COVID-19 related assumptions that are reflected in today's guidance update. In summary, our financial guidance reflects our expectation that most healthcare systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020, including in-person doctor visits, new-to-brand prescription trends, sales force activities and clinical trial enrollment. The guidance also assumes we will be able to continue to operate our manufacturing and supply chain without material disruption, and that we will continue to invest in potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 throughout 2020. With that, let's take a look at our guidance. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance. As a reminder, those three steps of guidance are as follows: Total Company, which reflects our current construct of the biopharma and Upjohn businesses and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan; Two, New Pfizer, which is a full year pro forma view that reflects the impact of the pending Viatris transaction by removing Upjohn and including $12 billion in cash proceeds from up Upjohn to New Pfizer and other transaction-related factors, such as transitional service agreement revenue; and three, Upjohn as a standalone business. Let me remind you that the Upjohn guidance includes the Meridian business and our collaboration with Mylan in Japan, as we discussed last quarter. All of these scenarios continue to be based on a full year of revenues and expenses in 2020. Beginning with total Company, as Albert mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS, despite absorbing incremental negative impacts due to foreign exchange fluctuations, since mid-January of approximately $600 million on revenue and $0.04 on adjusted diluted EPS. Moving down the income statement, we lowered our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance range by 0.4 percentage points to reflect favorability, resulting from changes in product mix and other efficiencies. For selling information and administrative expenses, we are lowering our guidance range by $500 million. This reflects incremental cost savings opportunities, primarily related to indirect SI&A spending, as well as actual and anticipated spending reductions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemics, and as Albert already spoke about the $500 million upward revision to our R&D expense range. Finally, our guidance continues to anticipate no share repurchases in 2020. Moving on to financial guidance for New Pfizer and Upjohn. Despite absorbing negative incremental impacts on revenues to the changes in foreign exchange rate since mid-January of approximately $500 million for New Pfizer and $100 million for Upjohn, we are reaffirming the fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance ranges for both pro forma companies. Additionally, we are reaffirming the guidance ranges for adjusted IBT margin and adjusted diluted EPS for New Pfizer, as well as adjusted EBITDA for Upjohn. The only change to the guidance we gave in New Pfizer is a $1 billion reduction in the range for operating cash flow, driven entirely by $1.25 billion voluntary U.S. pension contribution, which we plan to make in the second half of 2020. Moving on to key takeaways. In the first quarter of 2020, our Company performed well in a challenging environment, driven by strong revenue growth from our biopharma business. We reaffirmed our 2020 guidance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS and we achieved multiple products and pipeline milestones since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here, demonstrating the continued advancement of our late-stage pipeline. Finally, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders this quarter. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck.\nChuck Triano: Thanks, Frank, and thanks, Albert, for those comments. Operator, can we please now poll for questions?\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much for the detailed review, and congratulations on the performance. So, I have two questions, please. First is with respect to the guidance and the second is on the vaccine candidate. So, with respect to the guidance and the assumptions on slide 13, could you just discuss what you're assuming with respect to a potential resurgence in COVID, during the start of the flu season and the fourth quarter, and the impact of that on healthcare systems and physician visits? And then second, with respect to your vaccine candidate with BioNTech, could you just discuss your level of conviction that you have the right candidate that will be safe and effective? And when do you expect to generate animal data, and when do you expect to generate initial human data? Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Dave, thank you very much. Very good questions, as usual. The first one is guidance. Let me ask Frank to make comments about the assumptions.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Yes. So, David, on our guidance, we are assuming a recovery in the second half of the year. We expect the second quarter to be as reported as primarily impacted in a negative way from the COVID-19 virus, but we do expect the recovery in the second half of the year. And that includes the items that we talked about in our comments. In-person doctor visits sought up again, new-to-brand prescription trends, sales force activities, clinical trial enrollment, and obviously all of our sites continuing to operate and provide medicines to patients the way that they're currently doing today. So punch line, second half recovery and the healthcare system returns to normal operations.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Frank. And now, Mikael, I think, you would like to comment on the vaccine, before let me say just one thing on the vaccine. This is new technology. But we are very familiar with both the technology and the company, because we are working with them the last two years in a joint project to develop with the same technology, a flu vaccine. So, we jumped into the COVID-19 when the need emerged jointly together. And we are applying, of course all the learnings of the -- the learnings that we had with the technology during the last two years. Now, Mikael, can you speak -- please speak more specifics about the specific project?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Albert, and Dave for asking these important questions. I will start by saying, I think we have the most comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine program currently ongoing and it's specifically related to mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we had built a lot of experience on the various type of mRNA and formulation of lipid nanoparticles through two years work on flu and a lot of different animal data coming from our work and work from BioNTech on both oncology and other programs. When it comes to the specific Lightspeed program as it's called, that has basically in two to three months moved from the drawing table to dosing patients right now. It contains, as we have announced four different vaccine candidates that will be studied in humans. The first one already dosed. And that allows us more than anyone to cherry pick from a new disease like COVID-19, what   type, what antigen is the most effective and allows us to pick one or two to move into pivotal studies. So, that covers unmodified mRNA, modified and self-amplifying. To the best of my knowledge, we are the only one currently having self-amplified mRNA in the clinic, which would allow you to dose, at lower dose than any other construct. We already have animal data from rodents on the various constructs that are encouraging. And we also have data from patients here that shows that the two antigens that we pick seem to be the most relevant for intervening and utilizing viruses. And by having picked two, spike or the smaller components receptor binding domain again, I think we will be able to cherry pick what turns out to translate most effectively in man. So, more animal data will come over the next few weeks on primates. And I expect human data to come late May-June from the first experiments performed on plasma from vaccinated patience. And this is a unique trial design with continuous data flow that should allow us to progress fast, share data with regulators. So, we expect the flow of data coming May, June, and then move into expanded trials that could allow emergency use or accelerated approval coming in the fall, possibly October and onwards. So, thank you very much for your questions.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And also let me add here, but the reason also why we jumped into this is not only because we've had the familiarity with the company, with the technology, and we had discussed this project that was very exciting, but also we have -- we are uniquely positioned to help during this crisis, because we have the end to end capabilities. We are having very strong capabilities from early preclinical research, all the way to manufacturing. And frankly, as I -- we have, I think said, but I make it very clear now also, we are planning to manufacture at risk, this vaccine. So, if the technical success and regulatory approvals are there, we will have doses available in -- during the last quarter of this year. And also, it would be an omission if I wouldn't mention right now that how grateful we are with the advice and collaboration that FDA is giving us that they are trying to work their timelines day and night as well, so that they can help bring to the world, a solution. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. \nChris Schott: Just two. First on Vyndaqel and the impact from COVID. It sounds like you're expecting a slowdown in diagnosis rates in the quarter. Should we also expect that RXs and patients receiving drug should also slow or could those actually keep ramping, once you've identified a product that can keep working through the process? My second question on Vyndaqel was also on payer mix. You've had a little bit more experience with the product. And we're still trying to get a sense of where gross to net could shake out for the product. So, any additional statistics here in terms of how many patients are getting free drug, how many are reimbursed? Any data there would be very helpful. My final question was on Prevnar in infants. Are your expectations for that product for the year unchanged, so that we're going to obviously see get 2Q impact, but you get kind of a catch up in the second half of the year, or should we actually be thinking about Prevnar infant expectations for the year coming down as that catch-up won't offset the lost sales in the quarter?\nAlbert Bourla: I think, all three questions are very well suited for Angela to answer. So, Angela, why you don\u2019t start with Vyndaqel?\nAngela Hwang: Great. Thank you. Thanks for those questions, Chris. So, firstly, on Vyndaqel. As you can see, we continue to have just great momentum behind this product. And we do believe that this will sustain its moment throughout the year. As Albert mentioned, we do think that there will be some slowdown in NRXs in the second quarter. And actually just to align with those comments, we did see that in our patient hub enrollments since the middle of March, we saw a decline of about 20% in the last four weeks, compared to the previous four weeks. So, I think that this comment about new patient starts is one that we are seeing in the patient hub. However, let's also think about the great attributes of Vyndaqel. It's an oral medication; it's one that is being delivered through specialty pharmacies directly to patients\u2019 homes; it's one that because of its mortality benefits, decreases hospitalizations. All of these really play well to the time that we're in right now in this pandemic. And so, we anticipate our continuing patients to be able to continue on their drugs and be able to stay on therapy, so no impact on TRxs. Your second question was around the payer mix. And on that front, we have not seen change in terms of the numbers of patients on commercial versus Medicare versus other books of business. That has been pretty consistent through the time from launch, and our Medicare patients are the predominant part of our patient population, and that hasn't changed at all. And then, I think the third question was on Prevnar P. And on Prevnar P, similarly consistent with comments made earlier, we do anticipate second quarter to have some slowdown. And this is just because, well visits aren't taking place, there is a lot more caution regarding visits to pediatrician's offices. So, we do anticipate some slowdown there. But, we also know both from our research and from our representatives that pediatricians are anxious and are motivated to get the well visits back and to have our infants, as well as our children vaccinated. And therefore based on that and based on the fact that we expect a recovery in second half per Frank's comments about our assumptions, we do anticipate a catch-up towards the second half of the year that will allow us to attain our expectations that we had for P for all of 2020.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Mikael, on your antiviral for COVID, you\u2019re going down the protease inhibitor track, instead of the nuc. Maybe, if you could explain the thought process? And if you could also lay out for us the exact EC50 that you're seeing with your 3CL inhibitor? And I asked because some of the initial 3CL inhibitor constructs you had chosen against SARS, the EC50s were above 10. So, I wonder if you are seeing something closer to a one on the protease inhibitor you've chosen. And secondly, on COVID vaccine, Mikael, I'm curious, what's the exact threshold on utilizing antibody titers that you want to see for you to say, you know what, we have something?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Umer. Mikael, the stage is yours.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you very much, Umer. Great questions here. So, let's start with protease inhibitors. We had a privilege. This isn\u2019t just repurpose protease inhibitor from a distant relative. We had a collection of compounds that showed very potent activity to the SARS-CoV-1. And we were able to model and show that it's a very strong similarity in the binding and have confirmed that these compounds on the SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19 disease are very potent. We are talking about very potent nanomolar type of binding. And it is supported by X-ray data available that shows again unique, highly selective binding patterns. We are now doing cellular antiviral studies, which initial data is encouraging again, showing potent activity, which needs to be studied on different cell types where the virus may be harbored. All together, we think these are very promising drug candidates. And we're moving swiftly ahead with scaling up, adding other IND type of data to potentially pending regulatory dialogues that have initiated to be able dose patients around August this year. We\u2019re also working on oral follow-on drug and have identified several candidates that show suitability for this type of delivery system. So, altogether, I feel very encouraged that this could be the first-in-class protease drug for SARS-CoV-2 and we'll keep you posted as we advance. On the vaccine, clearly, we are looking at what could be animal data guiding us on what should be the relevant threshold in order to have neutralization of virus. And we have in discussion with regulators gotten good feedback on data from multiple animal models that we are pursuing that could help to possibly even create a surrogate endpoint. We're also looking at convalescent serum from patients to understand, which of those that are used for treatment intervention guides us and will actually use those also in intervention models. So, while we expect in our Phase 2 study later summer, Q3 early to generate human data on our vaccine when it comes to impacts on events. These will be supplemented by multiple animal models and plasma levels of neutralizing antibodies used in transfusion therapies. So, all-in-all, a multi-pronged approach to nail down the type of levels we should aim for, and to keep with the most aspirational goal of getting a vaccine that can be considered for emergency use, accelerated approval around Q3 this year. Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And also to add with the antiviral as we did with the vaccines, we are producing at risk clinical material. So, in case we decide to go into summer and do clinical studies, as Michael said, we will be able to do it immediately.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. The first is, given the current environment, I was just wondering if there are any changes to how you're approaching capital allocation here. Do you expect M&A and business development opportunities to increase? I think, you had talked on your fourth quarter call about potentially finalizing some deals in the first half of the year. So, just wondering if there's been any change on that front? And then, my second question is on your 20-valent pneumococcal disease program. We've now seen the top line data for the adult Phase 3 setting come out. Just wondering what outstanding questions are left here on that program, as you look ahead on the forward and securing the filing in the fourth quarter?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. So, Frank, would you like to make some comments on the capital allocation?\nFrank D'Amelio: Sure. So, Terence, on capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, which are obviously dividends and we paid a $2.1 billion dividend to our shareholders this quarter, investing in the business, and then obviously M&A, so mergers and acquisitions. And clearly, there has been some value reset in the industry, and you can see some of that with some of the biotechs. And obviously, as we always do, we'll look for opportunities where we think it's a good deal for our company and for our shareholders. The one thing I want to balance this with though is, even though valuations reset, Board of Directors and management teams expectations don't necessarily reset at the same pace. So, that's always something we have to work our way through. But from a high level priority perspective, our capital allocation priorities remain the same.\nTerence Flynn: Thank you, Frank. And then, Mikael, is there anything that you're waiting more on, pneumococcal adult or you think you can file?\nMikael Dolsten: We are very confident in the pneumococcal adult after completion of the main efficacy studies that we have done a press release, and it has the immunogenicity, safety and scalability that we were looking for. We also recently had a lot consistency study to readout, which again, showed similar grade profile for the 20-valence to be used in the adult setting. We are still having one study that is for patients previously immunized with pneumococcal vaccines that will be coming shortly. But for na\u00efve patients, we do have all data available, looking like a very strong profile and we are yet to supplement with the data sets coming on previously immunized, which, this would be to expand the coverage. And that's why we feel very confident about filing and you heard from Albert's introduction that we moved it to early Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.\nRandall Stanicky: Just two questions, probably both for Angela. Can you just talk about the Ibrance trends, particularly EU5 price headwinds? When do those abate, and how should we think about Ibrance growth for this year? And then, just a follow-up on Vyndaqel, the 13% diagnosis rate, it's a nice jump from 4Q of 9%. Any change to where you guys think that can ultimately get to, putting aside near-term headwinds from COVID?\nAlbert Bourla: Angela, go ahead.\nAngela Hwang: So, on Ibrance in the EU, I want to affirm that our fundamentals and our growth of Ibrance in the EU continues to be really strong. And we continue to see great growth opportunities into the future. Right now, the first line metastatic breast cancer share of the CDK class is only at 38. So, there's room for growth here. And we do have a strong leading market share of 68% of all CDKs. So, I think just right there, you can see that there are continued opportunities for growth. And that is how we see it. We saw very strong double-digit growth for Ibrance in volume. And what you didn't see and why that didn't translate into net sales is because we negotiated a number of very large contracts with certain large European countries. Many of these happened in Q4 of 2019. And because these contracts are multiyear, what you get here now is some stability in that. And so, this has allowed us to rebase our businesses. So, those impacts are already included in our guidance. And because of the timing of when these contracts are signed, we expect to return to net sales growth in the second half of 2020. So, all-in-all, I think it's just the timing and the year-on-year comparison that is driving the effect of what you're seeing from a net sales perspective. And I want to reaffirm that our fundamentals are strong, our value proposition of Ibrance is strong. And we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity both for the class, as well as our own share. Your next question was about Vyndaqel. And I think your question was around just sort of diagnosis and whether we're seeing anything particular there. And no, I mean, the strategy that we have deployed from the beginning, which is to find and heightened awareness around, which patients we should suspect for ATTR-CM and then have those patients be then diagnosed through scintigraphy, continues to be mainstay of how we are generating diagnosis. With time, we are deploying and we're experimenting with the artificial intelligence and different sort of predictive models that might allow us to again support the suspicion of these patients. But, I would say that our strategies have been rather consistent since launch. And I think that the diagnosis rates that we're seeing tell us that what we've been doing is working well. There's great receptivity for this product, both from physicians as well as from patients. We are very active on the education front, both from a diagnosis and from a treatment perspective. So, I think that what we've been doing is really working well and will continue to do so.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: On your 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Just an update on timing for when we are likely to see the Phase 3 trial start in  to keep that gap with Merck as small as possible? And then, second question on adjuvant Ibrance, just an update on timing of when we will see the data? And when you do top-line that are you likely to disclose any results or is it just going to be a qualitative top-line? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Let me take quickly the adjuvant and then Mikael, please answer the 20-valent and add if you have anything on the adjuvant. We have not run any interim analysis yet on PALLAS study. And we expect, as we said before, the study will come to conclusion -- excuse me, will come to completion, which means that we will not stop expect during the interim because as I said very high criteria for study. So, typically, we do not announce when we have interim analysis data and visibility unless if we stop. So, as I said, we don't have data, we haven't performed an analysis yet. An analysis has not been performed. Typically we don't announce it and the study will come to completion as expected, early in 2021. So, Mikael, on the 20-valent, on the pace, when we can start the Phase 3 and then you have to add something on the PALLAS.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you very much Albert and Tim for the questions. We offered a press release of the three injections immunization  we later shared that the fourth dose further substantiates data. We have had extensive regulatory dialogues in the U.S. and elsewhere and shared all those data sets. So, we are planning to start the ped  PCV-20 very soon. We're talking likely about just a few weeks to be clear. So, that's our projected plans right now. And I think you said very well on the adjuvant Ibrance studies that we feel very optimistic and good about them and just waiting for them to report on the date that we have communicated.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Angela, do you want to add anything on the pediatric marketplace as we see it potentially playing out?\nAngela Hwang: As you said, we will launch tentatively after the Merck 15. However, we don't anticipate that the ACIP will make a preferential recommendation between the two. And therefore, we believe that PCV-13 will compete with 15 until the PCV-20 comes to market. And we are confident about PCV-13. It has tremendous experience with healthcare professionals. We have very strong account management developed with our customers through the years that we've been on the market and we also have a very reliable supply track record. And so, despite there may be gap in launches, we anticipate to be competing in the market and to continue to support the benefits of PCV-13 to infants.\nOperator: Your next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So my first question for you is, do you have any update or more details on the go forward strategy for Pfizer, post the Upjohn separation as it pertains to M&A, pipeline assets, what you're thinking about there? And then, what in your DMD Phase 1b data gave you confidence to move into Phase 3 studies? Where are you with manufacturing? And what type of data do you think you'll report out at ASGCT? And then, my last question here is just back on PCV-20. Just curious if you think from the adult side that the ACIP recommendation would change at all if you were to get approved for PCV-20? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Let me maybe speak a little bit on this rather than M&A. And then, John also can add to that. And then, I will ask Mikael on the DMD, and then maybe Angela on the PCV-20 again, how ACIP will do the adults. On the go for strategy, our strategy is very clear and will remain the same. Of course, there is expected separation with Upjohn. Pfizer will become a top-line best-in-class growth story. And we are feeling more and more confident about it. We are strengthening our language around the 6%. Today, I said at least 6% will grow and that we expect that will continue. Now, the M&A is not a strategy. It is a tool to support the strategy. And that's why the M&A in the past were much more geared towards buying revenues or buying earnings growth by big mergers that could cut costs, because this is what we needed at that time. Right now moving forward, we are not in a need to buy EPS. Our EPS will grow organically as our revenues will grow organically. So, our M&A, although we never say never or anything in M&A. But right now, it is -- we will continue that. Our strategy is not to go to a big M&A for the following three reasons. One, it is that very few targets will provide -- will not dilute our growth, very few. Most of them will grow less than us. So, we'll have dilution. Secondly that targets, usually they want a significant premium. And those make me feel that most of the value is captured by the shareholders of the acquirer, like the one that is making the acquisition. And of course, those big acquisitions are creating some destruction which R&D could be an issue. So, these are the considerations. In terms of saying where are we going to invest our capital, if this is not our first priority for the reasons that I said. We are going to invest in early Phase 2, Phase 3 ready to start potential medicines that could be part of our pipeline, so that we will strengthen the pipeline that is coming post -- as products post \u201825, \u201826, \u201827, \u201828, so that we can sustain the growth that already we feel very confident we have organically or in the next five, six years. So, that's on our strategy and M&A. Now, DMD, Mikael, what makes you optimistic?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you very much. I mean, it's such a transformative area, treating these boys with Duchenne. So, we have now treated, as you will learn more at the conference, 11 patients, 8 of them at the high dose of 3 to the 14. And we continue to show -- see very consistent, based on efficacy, looking at the dystrophin expression, the distribution of the dystrophin. And as we have treated more patients and the early boys that were treated, we have now longer observation period, we can also see that durability seems to exceed 12 months when it comes to the , which makes us feeling very good that it could be a long durability for these boys. And we also have data coming out on muscle health, creatine kinase and more recently MRI that allow us again to add another level of confidence that we're changing the health of the muscles. And finally, for the motor function, where you use clinical scales, we have seen now across a number of treated boys a favorable data on their Northstar Index. And I want to point out that we're seeing it cross different ages because if you mainly monitor early boys for this, they do have some spontaneous improvements that could be difficult to differ from treatment induced. But we have also seen it on older boys, where you expect decline, but we have noted improvement instead. So, all-in-all, we feel that we have now accumulated a very robust data set on efficacy, and we have learned important experiences how to mitigate risk and manage any possible safety event. Of course, we have one of the largest efforts on new therapy manufacturing that has been expanding in North Carolina, and that will all come together now in our plan to start Phase 3 trials in just a few months. So, thank you for your interest.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Really, very exciting news for these boys particularly, they have virtually no solutions right now. Angela, what about our views on what would be the recommendations of ACIP on the adult pneumococcal vaccine, the 20 and competition?\nAngela Hwang: Yes. So, we're really excited about our PCV-20 programs, and specifically about the breadth that serotypes coverage that PCV20 provides. And we really see the benefits in two ways. One, first of all, these incremental serotypes are associated with high case fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and/or meningitis. So, these are sort of serious diseases that these serotypes will be able to cover. But also relative to PCV-15, PCV-20 is expected to provide 33% more coverage against IPD strains in adults.  So, with these data, our plan is to bring this forward to the CDC and to regulatory authorities. We will certainly be discussing recommendations and what all this means. But, I think in the end, we will know that this is a decision that the CDC needs to make. And we will be having these conversations with them as our program develops. But, certainly, we feel very strongly about the potential benefits and the additional coverage that PCV-20 can provide. And we'll keep you posted with what happens with the CDC.\nAlbert Bourla: And John, you have to add any comments on our going forward strategy, given that you're managing this area very successfully right now and particularly on M&A targets or licensing targets that we have?\nJohn Young: Obviously, we don't talk about specific targets, as you all know. But, I think Albert sort of really hit on the sort of main points in our -- in his answer, which is we feel really good about the prospects for the continued growth of our core business. In terms of business development to strengthen that, our focus is absolutely on clinical stage assets. I think, Frank touched on this in his answer to capital allocation earlier on. But, we're really very focused on clinical stage assets that could complement our existing internal pipeline that we feel good about. So, we're going to be focused on areas including oncology where there could be interesting tuck-ins. We're going to be looking at rare disease. There's a lot of innovation taking place there. And I think we're uniquely placed, because of the capabilities and manufacturing and development that Mikael has touched on to add to our pipeline. And we continue to look across our other areas as well, select opportunities. So, we think there are opportunities out there. We continue to be very active in this space. But of course, we're always doing to make sure that we're disciplined how we deploy capital in a way that really optimizes value for our shareholders, but most importantly for our patients. So, I think between Albert's and Frank\u2019s answers, hopefully that gives you a flavor how we feel about a capital deployment and business development for our business strategy post separation of Upjohn.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. I'm not sure if we answered also the question on DMD about manufacturing. And yes, we feel very good about manufacturing. Our investments are progressing very nicely. And we will be able to manufacture at scale from the DMD, provided that it is successful and runs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I had a few questions. First on abrocitinib. I believe only the higher dose was better than Dupixent. But, there were safety issues at that dose. And it was not superior on itch. It seems the outlook is not all that positive. You obviously think differently. So, could you explain? Secondly, you spoke about the PALLAS trial. But to clarify, the PENELOPE-B neoadjuvant trial, did you say the readout is now Q1 of '21? We had thought it was likely to be top-line this year. And then, lastly, can you just quantify the Eliquis stocking in the quarter? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. I will very quickly answer the PENELOPE -- no, the Penelope is expected to come in the second half of the year. The PALLAS is expected to come early next year. This is exactly as you had said it before. Mikael, why do you -- are you excited about abrocitinib?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. We are very excited about abrocitinib. And let me just punctuate a few things. In the JADE COMPARE study, we show that both, high and medium doses met coprimary endpoint and very effectively reducing eczema. We had a key a secondary endpoint of comparing itch to Dupixent standard of care. And this is one of the most patient-centric endpoints impacting quality of life, both day and nighttime. And the high dose statistically significantly showed better effect clinically meaningful than Dupixent, while the lower dose, the 100 milligram numerically was better, but didn't reach statistical significance. Overall, what we see is more rapid onset with our power abrocitinib than the biological Dupixent. And we see a more rapid onset numerically, whether you look at skin clearance or whether you see -- look at itch. And while there is some more infections, always with higher doses of JAK inhibitor, we think and I believe that the benefit versus the risk is still very favorable. These are mild to moderate cases, most attenuate and basically all attenuate if you discontinue treatment. And I wanted to finally emphasize that we have a very exciting additional trial that is not necessary for filing, but it's coming later this year that trial regimen that will study, if you start on the 200 milligram, which we know will clear skin, reduce itch much faster than standard of care. And then, you can switch maintenance to the 100-milligram, which likely had a lower level of any adverse events, including infection. So, that gives you potentially max flexibility to treat and clean up, itch in skin and go on a lower dose. But again, the benefit risk to me looks very favorable also for the higher dose. These infections are relatively rare or mild to moderate and can easily be managed and are quite common for patients treated by dermatologists. So, I feel very good about high dose being superior and the lower dose being somewhat similar to Dupixent, still having faster onset of action numerically and it's oral and very convenient to take. I hope that gave you a good sense why I feel encouraged to see these new treatment options for patients, moving to regulatory discussions, and hopefully soon available.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And Angela, what about the inventory levels? Can you explain, of Eliquis? \nAngela Hwang: Yes. In terms of this Eliquis impact, what we saw was an uptick in terms of inventory levels to prepare for the pandemic, and the impact was about in the mid single digits, in terms of worldwide revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. I know that you've added a couple of very distinguished scientists to Board, also added a former FDA Commissioner, under your tenure Albert, as well as the Mylan transaction. Should we thing about this as an accelerated evolution of Pfizer in terms of trying to improve the ROI that has had historically on R&D? And if so, aside from the measures I outlined, perhaps you could highlight any other internal, either organizational or current enrichment that's going on that also points in that direction? And then second to Mike, Pfizer seems to have pivoted away from immuno-oncology, as many others have done, given the disappointments post-PD-1. If we do see the emergence of novel IO targets, such as  assets for the randomized Phase 2 trials, should I assume that Pfizer\u2019s willing to reengage back in that field? And I know I'm exaggerating in terms of binary, but it does seem that you have pivoted back towards to more molecules? Then finally, if you could comment on the anticipated treatment duration in the real-world setting for PALLAS, given the issues with adverse events as well as reimbursement friction for Medicare patients? \nAlbert Bourla: Andrew, can you repeat the first part of your question, the ROI?\nAndrew Baum: Yes. So, I was basically saying that under your tenure, Albert, there's a notable addition of three individuals with high scientific calibers. So, obviously, the former FDA Commissioner, but also two very distinguished scientists as well as decomplexifying the organization by the Upjohn transaction. So, when I think about the evolution of the business on the Pfizer, it does seem there's a concerted attempt to try and shine more light or improve the ROI through some of these measures. So, I was asking, are there any other internal measures, talents enrichment inside the organization, or new R&D structures designed to improve R&D, either through accelerating programs, killing early the normal stuff, but if something changed in the profile of improving the ROI on R&D\u2026\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. And the answer is absolutely yes. It\u2019s not by chance that right now in our Board we have five top scientists, four of them physicians, top scientists that they have unique expertise either in regulatory science, they have unique expertise in development, they have unique expertise in basic science, both in primary care in metabolic diseases and immunology. We have also through Susan Hockfield -- she was the pioneer of bringing together the genomic data with computation power. She was the first biologist and first woman to be any head of -- President of the MIT. And there's a very clear statement that Pfizer is different. Pfizer is a science-based company, and this is where the growth is coming. And we are adding those Board members to provide also more visibility, but also because they help us with their very high knowledge. Now, there is not one or two, there are multiple measures -- metrics that we are using to assess if indeed our R&D machine is a new machine and if we can count on it in this new strategy. And they are all pointing in this direction. I think, we've made very clear that the Pfizer of the past, because you ask a question how, if you can kill quickly and if you can let\u2019s say progress things that they really matter rather than move everything. Pfizer of the past had a success rate of Phase 2 studies of 15%. When I say, over the past, few years back, 15%, when the industry was a third. Today, Pfizer's success rate, it is close to 50%, and that's on a rolling four years assessment right now. And I'm sure, next year will be 50% or rolling 50%. And this is not the only one. In 2018, we were the Company that introduced most new molecular entities of anybody else, who would expect that from Pfizer. And we can go on and on.  John Young has a very detailed list of criteria. And he's managing the governing process. But, he is making sure that as we allocate capital, we allocate with R&D ROI in mind. And also I will add that the speed with which the Company is reacting, has nothing to do with the Company in the past. And by the way, this is very well indicated in the way that we were able to move better than any biotech in speed in developing machine or in the speed in developing an antiviral. And the reason why we have been able to accomplish this speed in addition to be cultural, it is also that we have break the company into 5 distinct business units plus 1 -- 6, excuse me 6 together with hospitals, business units, and that each one of these business units, for example, oncology vaccines or diseases, they operate like a biotech. They make decisions end to end from commercial to early R&D within this structure, like as I said, if they were a biotech company. And they are presenting their requests for finance and into -- the community that John Young is managing, so that we can allocate the capital. And last but not least, although Pfizer is laser focused on this an ROI of R&D as we are progressing, it was absolutely to avoid misunderstanding. It was absolutely none of -- it was absolutely not one of our criteria, when we jumped into the COVID-19 programs. The only criteria that we used as we jumped into the COVID-19 projects was, if we are -- we can have a solution, if we can make the difference, if we think that our technology is good one, so that you can bring a vaccine or an antiviral, because this is not times that ROI should prevail for COVID-19, it is times that the solutions will be found. So, with that, I hope I gave you some color on how Pfizer is changing and what is the meaning which is more than symbolic of appointing the new Board members. And I go to Mikael, to answer your second question.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you for that question. We think we need to be careful and not throw everything under the kitchen into immune-oncology. We try really to cherry pick the areas where we have learned after the initial positioning of PDXs,  one example is bifunctional antibodies. We have a dose escalation of a BCMA bifunctional that looks very encouraging which subcutaneous unique profile. We have follow-on PD-1 bifunctional with cytokines that can boost immune resistance. And we have oncolytic viruses. We were successful combining Inlyta with PDX, and we're building on that experience to now move from actually our Boulder units form Array, a small molecule this year that we think is an immune enhancer for cancer an XMR  inhibitor. So I hope you got that answer that we are cherry picking areas where we think we can break resistance to IO rather than serving everything on to these area.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, one, maybe following up on the abrocitinib question from before, Steve's question for Mikael. I think, I get the enthusiasm you have on the efficacy side and the convenience side. Because my question is just more on safety, now that you've seen the COMPARE data, maybe as you think about the filing. Just your level of confidence on the label being clean from some of the black box warnings we see for the current JAK and infection malignancies and obviously also BTEs. I think, in talking to dermatologists, it seems like it\u2019ll be critical for it to be -- to not have a black box in order to compete the product like Dupixent. So, maybe, just you can share your views there? And then, second also on the immunology pipeline. Your JAK-3 -- the 1600, just curious on timing on that. I think clinical trial says that the trial\u2019s expected to read on the Phase 2, Phase 3 expected in September of this year but it also says it\u2019s still recruiting patients. So, just trying to get a better sense of when we might see data for that product? I know it has breakthrough status. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Vamil. Mikael? \nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Abrocitinib, we have a large database. I feel very good about its profile. We have not seen any cardiovascular issues. And that's really what is worrying about safety. While we see as expected some viral skin infections, I consider a more of safety, tolerability and very mild and moderate, and can be well managed with standard experience in medical practice. I cannot speculate about black box. That's really for regulators. Our JAK-3 in alopecia has a very unique profile. The most selective of all JAKs that I've seen this far, we think readout will be probably, as we have predicted, mid-\u201821 and this is a pivotal study that could go quickly to filing. We do have end of this year a number of JAK inhibitor readouts in the Phase 2, like JAK-3 in vitiligo, we have oral too in psoriasis and topical in atopic dermatitis. So, we'll keep you busy with a flow of news.\nOperator: Your next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob: Thanks so much. Navin from UBS. Thanks for fitting me in. Mikael, I just wanted to just touch upon the commentary with regards to the regulators and allowing surrogate markers as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Just want to dig into that a little bit more. What specifically will they be looking for that allows speedy approval? And then, I want to understand the manufacturing targets that you have by year-end, if approved? If approved, I just want to understand, is it -- I'm assuming it's going to be under a sort of extended access use basis for healthcare workers? And then, what do you need from regulators for a broad approval for the general public? Any kind of clarity around that would be helpful.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. I do not know how the regulators would like to regulate that. And I leave it to them. But, I can answer the question on the manufacturing. So, we expect that we will have in the last quarter of this year, millions of doses basically ready. And then, for \u201821, we could ramp up to hundreds of millions of doses available. Now, Mikael, maybe a little bit you can answer the question about the endpoints or the surrogate endpoints.\nMikael Dolsten: There are, of course interest of both regulators and pharmas to see how we can learn maximally to allow potentially very important vaccine, quickly to deal with both medical and business crisis. We have had ample discussions with the highest level of regulatory leaders in both U.S. and Europe. So, in the surrogate side, there are two animal guiding principles, if you can show for life threatening diseases data. And we are pursuing mice/hamsters, as well as primate studies that are ongoing and will hopefully show to us what level of immune activity interferes with the virus. And we're also doing some, I think, really creative studies taking patient sera and testing them, how they can intervene in these models and trying to correlate convalescence, patient transfusions, and what levels protect the disease or, can halt the progression of disease in patients. So, I think this is a unique area where we will have human and animal data coming together in Q3 to possibly provide a surrogate. But, we are planning from our Phase 2 study of the vaccines to also have human event rates. So it's more of having a really comprehensive approach to bring confidence and accelerate the potential approval or emergency use of these. It's not relying on just one approach. It\u2019s multiple approaches that we bring it together in close dialogues with the highest level of regulators.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, just one on sort of your view on the OUS pricing dynamics coming out of COVID. Just your expectations on the potential likelihood of incremental pricing pressure from government funded health care systems, given like the pressure on EU budgets and expectation we see, similar austerity measures like we saw last decade? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: So, I think, it's very difficult to predict. And in any case, I think our assumptions, it is -- the pricing is not the growth driver. Pricing is -- volume is going to be our growth driver, even without COVID. But I think, if I had to speak on a high level on COVID right now, I think and not on the short-term, but on the long-term, as you are asking. I see two dynamics here. One is the one that you mentioned, which is likely governments will have, let's say, budgetary pressures and we know that that's typically an area that they try to go. So, that I think will be towards the negatives. But also we see that the value proposition of the pharmaceutical industry has been drastically reset in the minds of the people right now. Because of the pharmaceutical industry right now in the middle of this crisis represent the whole of the billions of people and the hundreds of millions of enterprises that will find a solution towards that. And I think that will work on the very positive side. So, it remains to be seen what will be the net-net of those two areas. But, I believe that in any case, it\u2019s not going to drive growth by pricing, it\u2019s going to be by volume. So, I guess this is the end of -- and thank you very much for all these questions, I really appreciate it. So, I think this is the end, Chuck. So, let me just thank you all for joining us today, for your continued interest and engagement within Pfizer. We are very happy to provide information and also are very happy to learn from you. As I said at the start, this is an extremely difficult time for everyone as such, it is both, a great privilege and a great responsibility for our colleagues to serve patients at this moment. We've had an opportunity to demonstrate the power of our science, and we'll do everything we can to do -- to be a part of the solution to this problem. And I want to close by acknowledging the healthcare workers on the frontlines whose heroic efforts have been an inspiration to all of us. Their courage, their dedication and expertise have saved countless lives right now and probably in the future even more. And on behalf of all Pfizer colleagues and their families, I say, thank you. So, have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

But, I think Albert sort of really hit on the sort of main points in our -- in his answer, which is we feel really good about the prospects for the continued growth of our core business. In terms of business development to strengthen that, our focus is absolutely on clinical stage assets. I think, Frank touched on this in his answer to capital allocation earlier on. But, we're really very focused on clinical stage assets that could complement our existing internal pipeline that we feel good about. So, we're going to be focused on areas including oncology where there could be interesting tuck-ins. We're going to be looking at rare disease. There's a lot of innovation taking place there. And I think we're uniquely placed, because of the capabilities and manufacturing and development that Mikael has touched on to add to our pipeline. And we continue to look across our other areas as well, select opportunities. So, we think there are opportunities out there. We continue to be very active in this space. But of course, we're always doing to make sure that we're disciplined how we deploy capital in a way that really optimizes value for our shareholders, but most importantly for our patients. So, I think between Albert's and Frank's answers, hopefully that gives you a flavor how we feel about a capital deployment and business development for our business strategy post separation of Upjohn."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks, I will discuss the first quarter business performance as well as recent milestones from our pipeline. However, I want to start with a few thoughts about the COVID-19 pandemic and Pfizer's role in helping find solution. It goes without saying that this is an extraordinarily, difficult and unprecedented time for everyone. The public health challenges posed by COVID-19 have impacted almost every aspect of our lives. As one of the world's largest biopharmaceuticals companies, our role in this crisis is dual. On the one hand, we are focused on maintaining the continuous supply of our medicines and vaccines to patients around the globe, while protecting the safety and wellbeing of all our colleagues of course. On the other hand, we are working with experts, both within and outside Pfizer to bring our expertise, capital and resources to help contribute potential medical solutions to this pandemic. Let me share a few examples of what we are doing on this front. With the burden on hospitals happening around the globe and expected to increase, the continued supply of our medicines and vaccines is now more critical than ever. I'm pleased to say that the Pfizer global supply team has done an outstanding job, keeping our manufacturing sites and related distribution channels operational, without significant supply disruptions. In terms of finding medical solutions for the pandemic, we are collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential novel approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19. We aim to leave no stone unturned and we have made advances on multiple fronts. Regarding prevention, we recently announced that Pfizer and the German biotech company, BioNTech have entered into a global collaboration agreement to co-develop the potential first-in-class mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. Last week, we received the regulatory approval from German authority Paul-Ehrlich-Institut to commence the first clinical trial for our COVID-19 vaccine candidates in Germany and the first patient has already been dosed. Dave, thank you very much. Very good questions, as usual. The first one is guidance. Let me ask Frank to make comments about the assumptions. Thank you, Frank. And now, Mikael, I think, you would like to comment on the vaccine, before let me say just one thing on the vaccine. This is new technology. But we are very familiar with both the technology and the company, because we are working with them the last two years in a joint project to develop with the same technology, a flu vaccine. So, we jumped into the COVID-19 when the need emerged jointly together. And we are applying, of course all the learnings of the -- the learnings that we had with the technology during the last two years. Now, Mikael, can you speak -- please speak more specifics about the specific project? Thank you, Mikael. And also let me add here, but the reason also why we jumped into this is not only because we've had the familiarity with the company, with the technology, and we had discussed this project that was very exciting, but also we have -- we are uniquely positioned to help during this crisis, because we have the end to end capabilities. We are having very strong capabilities from early preclinical research, all the way to manufacturing. And frankly, as I -- we have, I think said, but I make it very clear now also, we are planning to manufacture at risk, this vaccine. So, if the technical success and regulatory approvals are there, we will have doses available in -- during the last quarter of this year. And also, it would be an omission if I wouldn't mention right now that how grateful we are with the advice and collaboration that FDA is giving us that they are trying to work their timelines day and night as well, so that they can help bring to the world, a solution. Thank you very much. I think, all three questions are very well suited for Angela to answer. So, Angela, why you don't start with Vyndaqel? Thank you, Umer. Mikael, the stage is yours. Thank you, Mikael. And also to add with the antiviral as we did with the vaccines, we are producing at risk clinical material. So, in case we decide to go into summer and do clinical studies, as Michael said, we will be able to do it immediately. Thank you very much. So, Frank, would you like to make some comments on the capital allocation? Angela, go ahead. Let me take quickly the adjuvant and then Mikael, please answer the 20-valent and add if you have anything on the adjuvant. We have not run any interim analysis yet on PALLAS study. And we expect, as we said before, the study will come to conclusion -- excuse me, will come to completion, which means that we will not stop expect during the interim because as I said very high criteria for study. So, typically, we do not announce when we have interim analysis data and visibility unless if we stop. So, as I said, we don't have data, we haven't performed an analysis yet. An analysis has not been performed. Typically we don't announce it and the study will come to completion as expected, early in 2021. So, Mikael, on the 20-valent, on the pace, when we can start the Phase 3 and then you have to add something on the PALLAS. Thank you. Angela, do you want to add anything on the pediatric marketplace as we see it potentially playing out? Thank you. Let me maybe speak a little bit on this rather than M&A. And then, John also can add to that. And then, I will ask Mikael on the DMD, and then maybe Angela on the PCV-20 again, how ACIP will do the adults. On the go for strategy, our strategy is very clear and will remain the same. Of course, there is expected separation with Upjohn. Pfizer will become a top-line best-in-class growth story. And we are feeling more and more confident about it. We are strengthening our language around the 6%. Today, I said at least 6% will grow and that we expect that will continue. Now, the M&A is not a strategy. It is a tool to support the strategy. And that's why the M&A in the past were much more geared towards buying revenues or buying earnings growth by big mergers that could cut costs, because this is what we needed at that time. Right now moving forward, we are not in a need to buy EPS. Our EPS will grow organically as our revenues will grow organically. So, our M&A, although we never say never or anything in M&A. But right now, it is -- we will continue that. Our strategy is not to go to a big M&A for the following three reasons. One, it is that very few targets will provide -- will not dilute our growth, very few. Most of them will grow less than us. So, we'll have dilution. Secondly that targets, usually they want a significant premium. And those make me feel that most of the value is captured by the shareholders of the acquirer, like the one that is making the acquisition. And of course, those big acquisitions are creating some destruction which R&D could be an issue. So, these are the considerations. In terms of saying where are we going to invest our capital, if this is not our first priority for the reasons that I said. We are going to invest in early Phase 2, Phase 3 ready to start potential medicines that could be part of our pipeline, so that we will strengthen the pipeline that is coming post -- as products post \u201825, \u201826, \u201827, \u201828, so that we can sustain the growth that already we feel very confident we have organically or in the next five, six years. So, that's on our strategy and M&A. Now, DMD, Mikael, what makes you optimistic? Thank you, Mikael. Really, very exciting news for these boys particularly, they have virtually no solutions right now. Angela, what about our views on what would be the recommendations of ACIP on the adult pneumococcal vaccine, the 20 and competition? And John, you have to add any comments on our going forward strategy, given that you're managing this area very successfully right now and particularly on M&A targets or licensing targets that we have? Thank you very much. I'm not sure if we answered also the question on DMD about manufacturing. And yes, we feel very good about manufacturing. Our investments are progressing very nicely. And we will be able to manufacture at scale from the DMD, provided that it is successful and runs. Thank you very much. I will very quickly answer the PENELOPE -- no, the Penelope is expected to come in the second half of the year. The PALLAS is expected to come early next year. This is exactly as you had said it before. Mikael, why do you -- are you excited about abrocitinib? Thank you, Mikael. And Angela, what about the inventory levels? Can you explain, of Eliquis? Andrew, can you repeat the first part of your question, the ROI? Thank you very much. And the answer is absolutely yes. It's not by chance that right now in our Board we have five top scientists, four of them physicians, top scientists that they have unique expertise either in regulatory science, they have unique expertise in development, they have unique expertise in basic science, both in primary care in metabolic diseases and immunology. We have also through Susan Hockfield -- she was the pioneer of bringing together the genomic data with computation power.

And then, for \u201821, we could ramp up to hundreds of millions of doses available. Now, Mikael, maybe a little bit you can answer the question about the endpoints or the surrogate endpoints. So, I think, it's very difficult to predict. And in any case, I think our assumptions, it is -- the pricing is not the growth driver. Pricing is -- volume is going to be our growth driver, even without COVID.

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and Dave for asking these important questions. I will start by saying, I think we have the most comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine program currently ongoing and it's specifically related to mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we had built a lot of experience on the various type of mRNA and formulation of lipid nanoparticles through two years work on flu and a lot of different animal data coming from our work and work from BioNTech on both oncology and other programs. When it comes to the specific Lightspeed program as it's called, that has basically in two to three months moved from the drawing table to dosing patients right now. It contains, as we have announced four different vaccine candidates that will be studied in humans. The first one already dosed. And that allows us more than anyone to cherry pick from a new disease like COVID-19, what   type, what antigen is the most effective and allows us to pick one or two to move into pivotal studies. So, that covers unmodified mRNA, modified and self-amplifying. To the best of my knowledge, we are the only one currently having self-amplified mRNA in the clinic, which would allow you to dose, at lower dose than any other construct. We already have animal data from rodents on the various constructs that are encouraging. And we also have data from patients here that shows that the two antigens that we pick seem to be the most relevant for intervening and utilizing viruses. And by having picked two, spike or the smaller components receptor binding domain again, I think we will be able to cherry pick what turns out to translate most effectively in man. So, more animal data will come over the next few weeks on primates. And I expect human data to come late May-June from the first experiments performed on plasma from vaccinated patience. And this is a unique trial design with continuous data flow that should allow us to progress fast, share data with regulators. So, we expect the flow of data coming May, June, and then move into expanded trials that could allow emergency use or accelerated approval coming in the fall, possibly October and onwards. So, thank you very much for your questions. Thank you very much, Umer. Great questions here. So, let's start with protease inhibitors. We had a privilege. This isn't just repurpose protease inhibitor from a distant relative. We had a collection of compounds that showed very potent activity to the SARS-CoV-1. And we were able to model and show that it's a very strong similarity in the binding and have confirmed that these compounds on the SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19 disease are very potent. We are talking about very potent nanomolar type of binding. And it is supported by X-ray data available that shows again unique, highly selective binding patterns. We are now doing cellular antiviral studies, which initial data is encouraging again, showing potent activity, which needs to be studied on different cell types where the virus may be harbored. All together, we think these are very promising drug candidates. And we're moving swiftly ahead with scaling up, adding other IND type of data to potentially pending regulatory dialogues that have initiated to be able dose patients around August this year. We're also working on oral follow-on drug and have identified several candidates that show suitability for this type of delivery system. So, altogether, I feel very encouraged that this could be the first-in-class protease drug for SARS-CoV-2 and we'll keep you posted as we advance. On the vaccine, clearly, we are looking at what could be animal data guiding us on what should be the relevant threshold in order to have neutralization of virus. And we have in discussion with regulators gotten good feedback on data from multiple animal models that we are pursuing that could help to possibly even create a surrogate endpoint. We're also looking at convalescent serum from patients to understand, which of those that are used for treatment intervention guides us and will actually use those also in intervention models. So, while we expect in our Phase 2 study later summer, Q3 early to generate human data on our vaccine when it comes to impacts on events. These will be supplemented by multiple animal models and plasma levels of neutralizing antibodies used in transfusion therapies. So, all-in-all, a multi-pronged approach to nail down the type of levels we should aim for, and to keep with the most aspirational goal of getting a vaccine that can be considered for emergency use, accelerated approval around Q3 this year. Thank you very much. We are very confident in the pneumococcal adult after completion of the main efficacy studies that we have done a press release, and it has the immunogenicity, safety and scalability that we were looking for. We also recently had a lot consistency study to readout, which again, showed similar grade profile for the 20-valence to be used in the adult setting. We are still having one study that is for patients previously immunized with pneumococcal vaccines that will be coming shortly. But for nai\u0308ve patients, we do have all data available, looking like a very strong profile and we are yet to supplement with the data sets coming on previously immunized, which, this would be to expand the coverage. And that's why we feel very confident about filing and you heard from Albert's introduction that we moved it to early Q4. Thank you very much Albert and Tim for the questions. We offered a press release of the three injections immunization  we later shared that the fourth dose further substantiates data. We have had extensive regulatory dialogues in the U.S. and elsewhere and shared all those data sets. So, we are planning to start the ped  PCV-20 very soon. We're talking likely about just a few weeks to be clear. So, that's our projected plans right now. And I think you said very well on the adjuvant Ibrance studies that we feel very optimistic and good about them and just waiting for them to report on the date that we have communicated. Thank you very much. I mean, it's such a transformative area, treating these boys with Duchenne. So, we have now treated, as you will learn more at the conference, 11 patients, 8 of them at the high dose of 3 to the 14. And we continue to show -- see very consistent, based on efficacy, looking at the dystrophin expression, the distribution of the dystrophin. And as we have treated more patients and the early boys that were treated, we have now longer observation period, we can also see that durability seems to exceed 12 months when it comes to the , which makes us feeling very good that it could be a long durability for these boys. And we also have data coming out on muscle health, creatine kinase and more recently MRI that allow us again to add another level of confidence that we're changing the health of the muscles. And finally, for the motor function, where you use clinical scales, we have seen now across a number of treated boys a favorable data on their Northstar Index. And I want to point out that we're seeing it cross different ages because if you mainly monitor early boys for this, they do have some spontaneous improvements that could be difficult to differ from treatment induced. But we have also seen it on older boys, where you expect decline, but we have noted improvement instead. So, all-in-all, we feel that we have now accumulated a very robust data set on efficacy, and we have learned important experiences how to mitigate risk and manage any possible safety event. Of course, we have one of the largest efforts on new therapy manufacturing that has been expanding in North Carolina, and that will all come together now in our plan to start Phase 3 trials in just a few months. So, thank you for your interest. Yes. We are very excited about abrocitinib. And let me just punctuate a few things. In the JADE COMPARE study, we show that both, high and medium doses met coprimary endpoint and very effectively reducing eczema. We had a key a secondary endpoint of comparing itch to Dupixent standard of care. And this is one of the most patient-centric endpoints impacting quality of life, both day and nighttime. And the high dose statistically significantly showed better effect clinically meaningful than Dupixent, while the lower dose, the 100 milligram numerically was better, but didn't reach statistical significance. Overall, what we see is more rapid onset with our power abrocitinib than the biological Dupixent. And we see a more rapid onset numerically, whether you look at skin clearance or whether you see -- look at itch. And while there is some more infections, always with higher doses of JAK inhibitor, we think and I believe that the benefit versus the risk is still very favorable. These are mild to moderate cases, most attenuate and basically all attenuate if you discontinue treatment. And I wanted to finally emphasize that we have a very exciting additional trial that is not necessary for filing, but it's coming later this year that trial regimen that will study, if you start on the 200 milligram, which we know will clear skin, reduce itch much faster than standard of care. And then, you can switch maintenance to the 100-milligram, which likely had a lower level of any adverse events, including infection. So, that gives you potentially max flexibility to treat and clean up, itch in skin and go on a lower dose. But again, the benefit risk to me looks very favorable also for the higher dose. These infections are relatively rare or mild to moderate and can easily be managed and are quite common for patients treated by dermatologists. So, I feel very good about high dose being superior and the lower dose being somewhat similar to Dupixent, still having faster onset of action numerically and it's oral and very convenient to take. I hope that gave you a good sense why I feel encouraged to see these new treatment options for patients, moving to regulatory discussions, and hopefully soon available. Thank you for that question. We think we need to be careful and not throw everything under the kitchen into immune-oncology. We try really to cherry pick the areas where we have learned after the initial positioning of PDXs,  one example is bifunctional antibodies. We have a dose escalation of a BCMA bifunctional that looks very encouraging which subcutaneous unique profile. We have follow-on PD-1 bifunctional with cytokines that can boost immune resistance. And we have oncolytic viruses. We were successful combining Inlyta with PDX, and we're building on that experience to now move from actually our Boulder units form Array, a small molecule this year that we think is an immune enhancer for cancer an XMR  inhibitor. So I hope you got that answer that we are cherry picking areas where we think we can break resistance to IO rather than serving everything on to these area. Yes. Abrocitinib, we have a large database. I feel very good about its profile. We have not seen any cardiovascular issues. And that's really what is worrying about safety. While we see as expected some viral skin infections, I consider a more of safety, tolerability and very mild and moderate, and can be well managed with standard experience in medical practice. I cannot speculate about black box. That's really for regulators. Our JAK-3 in alopecia has a very unique profile. The most selective of all JAKs that I've seen this far, we think readout will be probably, as we have predicted, mid-\u201821 and this is a pivotal study that could go quickly to filing. We do have end of this year a number of JAK inhibitor readouts in the Phase 2, like JAK-3 in vitiligo, we have oral too in psoriasis and topical in atopic dermatitis. So, we'll keep you busy with a flow of news. There are, of course interest of both regulators and pharmas to see how we can learn maximally to allow potentially very important vaccine, quickly to deal with both medical and business crisis. We have had ample discussions with the highest level of regulatory leaders in both U.S. and Europe. So, in the surrogate side, there are two animal guiding principles, if you can show for life threatening diseases data. And we are pursuing mice/hamsters, as well as primate studies that are ongoing and will hopefully show to us what level of immune activity interferes with the virus. And we're also doing some, I think, really creative studies taking patient sera and testing them, how they can intervene in these models and trying to correlate convalescence, patient transfusions, and what levels protect the disease or, can halt the progression of disease in patients. So, I think this is a unique area where we will have human and animal data coming together in Q3 to possibly provide a surrogate. But, we are planning from our Phase 2 study of the vaccines to also have human event rates. So it's more of having a really comprehensive approach to bring confidence and accelerate the potential approval or emergency use of these. It's not relying on just one approach. It's multiple approaches that we bring it together in close dialogues with the highest level of regulators."

            "name": "Frank D'Amelio",
            "content": "Thanks, Albert. Good day, everyone. Before I walk you through our results for the quarter, I want to comment on the current global pandemic, which is impacting nearly every industry around the world. Despite the challenges inherent in operating in this environment, the fundamentals of our business continue to be strong and our outlook for the future of the Company remains bright. We continue to have a strong balance sheet and favorable credit rating, which we expect to allow us to access the capital markets as needed, which was demonstrated in late March with the issuance of a $1.25 billion sustainability bond, the first of its kind in our industry. On the supply side, all 49 of our manufacturing facilities remain operational, and we have not seen a significant disruption in our supply chain as a result of the pandemic. To ensure the safety of our manufacturing colleagues while they perform this critical work, we have put in place enhanced safety measures at all of our plants, including investing in protective equipment, staggering shifts so that fewer colleagues are present at once, restricting site access to only essential workers and requiring colleagues to log their contacts while on site. I want to acknowledge how proud I am of the way our colleagues, many of whom are on the frontlines in this fight, have responded to this crisis with courage and passion from those who are working around the clock on potential treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 to those who continue to operate on manufacturing and supply chain to ensure patients can have the medicines they need. This is in times like these that the strength of our culture and of our people really shines. Now, onto the financials. First quarter 2020 revenues were $12 billion, down 7% operationally versus the year ago quarter. Of course, most of this decline is due to the fact that we no longer report revenues for our consumer healthcare business. Excluding this impact, revenues were down 1% operationally. As Albert already explained in detail, our biopharma revenues grew 12% operationally this quarter, driven by strength across multiple products with approximately 1 percentage point of that growth attributable to the net impact of COVID-19 on product sales. Upjohn revenues declined 37% operationally, driven by generic competition for Lyrica in the U.S. and declining sales of Lipitor and Norvasc in China due to implementation and nationwide expansion of the volume-based procurement program. Importantly, both of these negative drivers were anticipated in our previous Upjohn guidance. For total Company, adjusted SI&A expenses in the quarter were down 16% operationally, approximately half of that decline was due to the fact that we no longer report expenses for the consumer healthcare business. The remainder of the decrease was driven by reductions in field force, advertising and promotional expenses, due to the LOE of Lyrica in the U.S. and lowest selling expenses for Lipitor and Norvasc in China, due to volume based procurement, as well as lower indirect SI&A spending associated with corporate-enabling functions. Both reported and adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter were down compared to the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues, mainly driven by the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in the U.S., partially offset by lower SI&A expenses. Finally, foreign exchange had a negative impact of $134 million or 1% on first quarter 2020 revenues and $0.02 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year-ago quarter. Before walking you through our guidance updates in detail, I want to acknowledge that no one currently knows exactly how and in what timeframe the COVID-19 pandemic will progress and eventually come to its resolution. Given those uncertainties along with our desire to be as transparent as possible, we are providing on this chart the key COVID-19 related assumptions that are reflected in today's guidance update. In summary, our financial guidance reflects our expectation that most healthcare systems around the world will begin to resume their normal functions in the second half of 2020, including in-person doctor visits, new-to-brand prescription trends, sales force activities and clinical trial enrollment. The guidance also assumes we will be able to continue to operate our manufacturing and supply chain without material disruption, and that we will continue to invest in potential treatments and vaccines against COVID-19 throughout 2020. With that, let's take a look at our guidance. Consistent with last quarter, we are providing three sets of financial guidance. As a reminder, those three steps of guidance are as follows: Total Company, which reflects our current construct of the biopharma and Upjohn businesses and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan; Two, New Pfizer, which is a full year pro forma view that reflects the impact of the pending Viatris transaction by removing Upjohn and including $12 billion in cash proceeds from up Upjohn to New Pfizer and other transaction-related factors, such as transitional service agreement revenue; and three, Upjohn as a standalone business. Let me remind you that the Upjohn guidance includes the Meridian business and our collaboration with Mylan in Japan, as we discussed last quarter. All of these scenarios continue to be based on a full year of revenues and expenses in 2020. Beginning with total Company, as Albert mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS, despite absorbing incremental negative impacts due to foreign exchange fluctuations, since mid-January of approximately $600 million on revenue and $0.04 on adjusted diluted EPS. Moving down the income statement, we lowered our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance range by 0.4 percentage points to reflect favorability, resulting from changes in product mix and other efficiencies. For selling information and administrative expenses, we are lowering our guidance range by $500 million. This reflects incremental cost savings opportunities, primarily related to indirect SI&A spending, as well as actual and anticipated spending reductions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemics, and as Albert already spoke about the $500 million upward revision to our R&D expense range. Finally, our guidance continues to anticipate no share repurchases in 2020. Moving on to financial guidance for New Pfizer and Upjohn. Despite absorbing negative incremental impacts on revenues to the changes in foreign exchange rate since mid-January of approximately $500 million for New Pfizer and $100 million for Upjohn, we are reaffirming the fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance ranges for both pro forma companies. Additionally, we are reaffirming the guidance ranges for adjusted IBT margin and adjusted diluted EPS for New Pfizer, as well as adjusted EBITDA for Upjohn. The only change to the guidance we gave in New Pfizer is a $1 billion reduction in the range for operating cash flow, driven entirely by $1.25 billion voluntary U.S. pension contribution, which we plan to make in the second half of 2020. Moving on to key takeaways. In the first quarter of 2020, our Company performed well in a challenging environment, driven by strong revenue growth from our biopharma business. We reaffirmed our 2020 guidance for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS and we achieved multiple products and pipeline milestones since our last quarterly update, some of which are listed here, demonstrating the continued advancement of our late-stage pipeline. Finally, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders this quarter. As always, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. Now, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Yes. So, David, on our guidance, we are assuming a recovery in the second half of the year. We expect the second quarter to be as reported as primarily impacted in a negative way from the COVID-19 virus, but we do expect the recovery in the second half of the year. And that includes the items that we talked about in our comments. In-person doctor visits sought up again, new-to-brand prescription trends, sales force activities, clinical trial enrollment, and obviously all of our sites continuing to operate and provide medicines to patients the way that they're currently doing today. So punch line, second half recovery and the healthcare system returns to normal operations. Sure. So, Terence, on capital allocation, our priorities remain the same, which are obviously dividends and we paid a $2.1 billion dividend to our shareholders this quarter, investing in the business, and then obviously M&A, so mergers and acquisitions. And clearly, there has been some value reset in the industry, and you can see some of that with some of the biotechs. And obviously, as we always do, we'll look for opportunities where we think it's a good deal for our company and for our shareholders. The one thing I want to balance this with though is, even though valuations reset, Board of Directors and management teams expectations don't necessarily reset at the same pace. So, that's always something we have to work our way through. But from a high level priority perspective, our capital allocation priorities remain the same."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Great. Thank you. Thanks for those questions, Chris. So, firstly, on Vyndaqel. As you can see, we continue to have just great momentum behind this product. And we do believe that this will sustain its moment throughout the year. As Albert mentioned, we do think that there will be some slowdown in NRXs in the second quarter. And actually just to align with those comments, we did see that in our patient hub enrollments since the middle of March, we saw a decline of about 20% in the last four weeks, compared to the previous four weeks. So, I think that this comment about new patient starts is one that we are seeing in the patient hub. However, let's also think about the great attributes of Vyndaqel. It's an oral medication; it's one that is being delivered through specialty pharmacies directly to patients' homes; it's one that because of its mortality benefits, decreases hospitalizations. All of these really play well to the time that we're in right now in this pandemic. And so, we anticipate our continuing patients to be able to continue on their drugs and be able to stay on therapy, so no impact on TRxs. Your second question was around the payer mix. And on that front, we have not seen change in terms of the numbers of patients on commercial versus Medicare versus other books of business. That has been pretty consistent through the time from launch, and our Medicare patients are the predominant part of our patient population, and that hasn't changed at all. And then, I think the third question was on Prevnar P. And on Prevnar P, similarly consistent with comments made earlier, we do anticipate second quarter to have some slowdown. And this is just because, well visits aren't taking place, there is a lot more caution regarding visits to pediatrician's offices. So, we do anticipate some slowdown there. But, we also know both from our research and from our representatives that pediatricians are anxious and are motivated to get the well visits back and to have our infants, as well as our children vaccinated. And therefore based on that and based on the fact that we expect a recovery in second half per Frank's comments about our assumptions, we do anticipate a catch-up towards the second half of the year that will allow us to attain our expectations that we had for P for all of 2020. So, on Ibrance in the EU, I want to affirm that our fundamentals and our growth of Ibrance in the EU continues to be really strong. And we continue to see great growth opportunities into the future. Right now, the first line metastatic breast cancer share of the CDK class is only at 38. So, there's room for growth here. And we do have a strong leading market share of 68% of all CDKs. So, I think just right there, you can see that there are continued opportunities for growth. And that is how we see it. We saw very strong double-digit growth for Ibrance in volume. And what you didn't see and why that didn't translate into net sales is because we negotiated a number of very large contracts with certain large European countries. Many of these happened in Q4 of 2019. And because these contracts are multiyear, what you get here now is some stability in that. And so, this has allowed us to rebase our businesses. So, those impacts are already included in our guidance. And because of the timing of when these contracts are signed, we expect to return to net sales growth in the second half of 2020. So, all-in-all, I think it's just the timing and the year-on-year comparison that is driving the effect of what you're seeing from a net sales perspective. And I want to reaffirm that our fundamentals are strong, our value proposition of Ibrance is strong. And we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity both for the class, as well as our own share. Your next question was about Vyndaqel. And I think your question was around just sort of diagnosis and whether we're seeing anything particular there. And no, I mean, the strategy that we have deployed from the beginning, which is to find and heightened awareness around, which patients we should suspect for ATTR-CM and then have those patients be then diagnosed through scintigraphy, continues to be mainstay of how we are generating diagnosis. With time, we are deploying and we're experimenting with the artificial intelligence and different sort of predictive models that might allow us to again support the suspicion of these patients. But, I would say that our strategies have been rather consistent since launch. And I think that the diagnosis rates that we're seeing tell us that what we've been doing is working well. There's great receptivity for this product, both from physicians as well as from patients. We are very active on the education front, both from a diagnosis and from a treatment perspective. So, I think that what we've been doing is really working well and will continue to do so. As you said, we will launch tentatively after the Merck 15. However, we don't anticipate that the ACIP will make a preferential recommendation between the two. And therefore, we believe that PCV-13 will compete with 15 until the PCV-20 comes to market. And we are confident about PCV-13. It has tremendous experience with healthcare professionals. We have very strong account management developed with our customers through the years that we've been on the market and we also have a very reliable supply track record. And so, despite there may be gap in launches, we anticipate to be competing in the market and to continue to support the benefits of PCV-13 to infants. Yes. So, we're really excited about our PCV-20 programs, and specifically about the breadth that serotypes coverage that PCV20 provides. And we really see the benefits in two ways. One, first of all, these incremental serotypes are associated with high case fatality rates, antibiotic resistance and/or meningitis. So, these are sort of serious diseases that these serotypes will be able to cover. But also relative to PCV-15, PCV-20 is expected to provide 33% more coverage against IPD strains in adults.  So, with these data, our plan is to bring this forward to the CDC and to regulatory authorities. We will certainly be discussing recommendations and what all this means. But, I think in the end, we will know that this is a decision that the CDC needs to make. And we will be having these conversations with them as our program develops. But, certainly, we feel very strongly about the potential benefits and the additional coverage that PCV-20 can provide. And we'll keep you posted with what happens with the CDC. Yes. In terms of this Eliquis impact, what we saw was an uptick in terms of inventory levels to prepare for the pandemic, and the impact was about in the mid single digits, in terms of worldwide revenue."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pfizer's fourth quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Frank D\u2019Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business and Innovation Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. We expect this call to last 90 minutes. The materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. 2021 was a watershed year for Pfizer, a year in which we set all-time highs in all major areas of focus for Pfizer. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion patients with our medicines and vaccines. That\u2019s more than one out of every six people on Earth. Never before has Pfizer\u2019s patient impact been so wide-reaching. We improved our ranking from fourth to second among large biopharma companies in the PatientView Global Survey. According to Morning Consult, 61% of Americans have a favorable view of Pfizer, which is up 33 points since January of 2020. Just last week, Fortune ranked us fourth on its annual World\u2019s Most Admired Companies list, the highest ranking we have ever achieved. 95% of our colleagues said in an internal survey that they are proud to work for Pfizer, which ranks among the best in corporate America. We increased our investments in research and development from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.5 billion in 2021, and we initiated 13 pivotal clinical studies, the highest number ever for Pfizer. Last but not least, we grew revenues by 92% operationally to $81.3 billion and adjusted diluted EPS by 92% operationally to $4.42. Our success in leading the fight against COVID-19 have not only made a positive difference in the world, I believe they have fundamentally changed our company and our culture forever. Colleagues across Pfizer are inspired by what we have achieved and are more determined than ever to be part of the next potentially game-changing breakthrough. To that end, we are applying the lightspeed principles developed for our COVID-19 work to our other therapeutic areas to make sure we continue to move at the speed of science for the benefit of all patients. As a result, we believe we can do even better with each of these metrics in 2022, each one of them. Our full-year 2022 financial guidance, for example, includes for the first time ever a forecasted revenue midpoint that is triple-digit, $100 billion and an adjusted diluted EPS midpoint of $6.45. While Comirnaty is having a significant positive impact on Pfizer\u2019s financial performance, it\u2019s the tremendous impact that COVID-19 vaccines have had on society that is most important. In the U.S. alone, the COVID-19 vaccination program is estimated to have saved more than 1 million lives and prevented more than 10 million hospitalizations, according to a December 2021 Commonwealth Fund Report. The economic impact is equally astonishing -- astounding. According to a December 2021 Heartland Forward Report, the rapid deployment and wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. created an estimated economic savings of $438 billion in 2021 alone, which amounted to U.S. GDP being 2.3% higher than it otherwise would have been, 2.3 points. I\u2019m proud to say that Pfizer contributed significantly to these benefits given that approximately 6 out of 10 doses administered in the U.S. as of February 6, 2022, were Comirnaty. This is the value of our science, what our culture has enabled and what drives our people. Now I would like to speak to three factors that will help drive our growth going forward. The first is the long-term outlook for COVID-19 and why we believe we are well positioned to continue to lead the battle against this disease. Second, our thoughtful capital allocation strategy and why we believe it can help drive our growth in the second part of the decade. And third, how our commitment to ESG principles is designed to create sustainable growth for Pfizer to deliver meaningful value to patients and society. Let me start with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our scientists continue to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus and believe it is unlikely that it will be fully eradicated in the foreseeable future. They believe this for several reasons. The global distribution of the virus makes it difficult to contain. The virus has shown an ability to mutate often, making it difficult to stay ahead of it. And the data appear to show that natural infections do not lead to the type of durable protection needed to prevent all transmissions and viral mutation. As a result, people can become reinfected by the same or different strains over time. That said, we now have the tools in the form of vaccines and treatments that we believe will help enable us to not only better manage the pandemic, but also help countries move into an endemic phase. In other words, we believe these tools will help allow us to go back to normality and spend time with family and friends, travel, attend indoor dining and concerts, and enjoy many other activities while lowering the risk of overburdening hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. All of us at Pfizer are extremely proud of the role we have continued to play in bringing these tools to the world. Throughout 2021, we continued our efforts to bring our COVID-19 vaccine to more populations and to further ramp up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. As a result, the market share of our Comirnaty vaccine has continued to grow, representing 70% of all doses distributed across the U.S. and EU as of February 5. When it comes to Paxlovid, we expect to produce 6 million treatment courses during the first quarter of '22. Overall, we expect to produce 30 million courses in the first half of 2022 and 120 million courses for the full year, of course, depending on the global need. Having recently received a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency, Paxlovid has now received emergency or conditional authorization for use with certain populations in approximately 40 countries so far. We are in discussions with governments around the world and expect that as the number of authorizations increase, so will the number of contracts for this treatment, which could truly be a game changer. At Pfizer, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to continue to invest in R&D to maintain our leadership in providing these tools and other meaningful solutions to the world. That\u2019s why we continue to develop and test different versions of our vaccine to potentially address variants of concern as they emerge, and why we are currently working on a new Omicron-based vaccine candidate and on a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It\u2019s also why just two months after receiving Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Paxlovid, we are already working on a potential next-generation oral COVID-19 treatment. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to maintain this leadership position because of our significant investments in R&D combined with our ability to move at the speed of science without compromising quality or safety, the strong credibility we have earned with governments, healthcare providers and consumers combined with our extensive global field presence, and our unparalleled capabilities for high-quality manufacturing at scale. Now the second thing I wanted to touch on is how we think about our capital allocation and to repeat once more our strategy. We feel that the entirety of our business continues to demonstrate a robust topline growth trajectory through 2025. Consensus estimates are beginning to slowly recognize this momentum. However, consensus estimates currently show our topline shrinking from 2025 to 2030. I want to repeat that this is inconsistent with our own plans. Our goal is to continue to be a growth company from '25 to 2030, despite the impact of LOEs expected during that period. Our confidence in our ability to achieve that is underpinned by the momentum of our business, the durability of our COVID-19 offerings as which I just described, the underestimated strength of our internal pipeline, and, of course, by our ability to deploy capital into growth-focused business development to access external science. Few words about them. We leverage business development opportunities to advance our business strategies and objectives. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top-line expectations. We expect to do this while still maintaining our growing dividend, as well as flexibility for other uses of our cash. The focus of our business development efforts will continue to be on compelling external science in the form of both later-stage assets, as well as earlier medical innovations, that have the potential to be breakthroughs for patients. Our focus will largely be in the therapeutic areas and platforms where we have the scientific skills and acumen to add substantial value and select the most successful targets. In addition, we feel that we have distinctive attributes such as world-class excellence in clinical development and unsurpassed manufacturing and commercial capabilities at scale that makes us a very attractive partner across a variety of deal arrangements. We believe the opportunities to deliver on this approach exist, and I will be personally focusing on this execution. I want to emphasize that despite our significant capital flexibility, we will never lower the scientific and financial standards we apply in our business development. As we pursue these opportunities, we will continue to be highly disciplined in our evaluation and prioritization processes. Since 2019, we have already invested almost $25 billion in business development transactions adding more than $13 billion in consensus, I repeat, in consensus 2030 revenue. I would point out that the $13 billion of consensus currently includes nothing for the Trillium assets, the Biohaven collaboration, or the recently announced mRNA deals, all of which have substantial potential. I see this pace of business development accelerating going forward, and I am confident it will be an important driver in ensuring Pfizer as a growth company in the back-half of this decade. One highly visible example of our approach to business development is the recent investments we are making in mRNA technology and collaborations. mRNA has emerged as a versatile technology, with potential applications across many infectious diseases, cancer, rare genetic disorders and even auto-immune diseases. Although mRNA is not the holy grail, we believe the technology has the potential to have a game-changing impact on global health, which is why we have developed a robust mRNA strategy and are aggressively building our platform. While the pandemic has demonstrated that it\u2019s not that easy to deliver mRNA vaccines at scale, Pfizer has emerged as a leader in this space. With decades of experience on our side, we\u2019ve developed what is arguably the most efficient clinical development and vaccine manufacturing capabilities the world has ever seen. We also have rapidly scaled and built out new capabilities in record time by hiring nearly 2,400 new colleagues in these functions in a nine-month timeframe. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest to capitalize on the leadership we have built in terms of both mRNA R&D and manufacturing. In addition, of course, to these internal investments and improvements, we\u2019re also making external investments to build out our capabilities in this space. For example, Pfizer recently has entered into four important business development deals to help advance our mRNA strategy. We are expanding our collaboration with BioNTech to use the existing platform to co-develop an mRNA vaccine candidate for herpes zoster virus to protect against shingles. Our agreement with Beam Therapeutics expands our mRNA efforts to another core therapeutic area for Pfizer, rare disease, with a four-year research collaboration for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. We believe this will give us the potential to use mRNA to treat diseases, not just preventive treatment. Our agreement with Acuitas gives us the ability to collaborate with and license their proprietary lipid nanoparticle technology for up to 10 targets for mRNA vaccines and therapies. We believe this will give us greater independence in this space. And we have signed a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Codex DNA, a leader in the development of automated solutions for on-demand synthesis of genes and mRNA, potentially allowing enzymatic assembly of DNA at the front-end of the mRNA production process. This could possibly reduce the time to produce a new vaccine from three months down to two months. If successful, this would be an important differentiator when developing a vaccine for the flu, for example, as it would allow us to select a strain much closer to the start of any flu season. These deals represent only four pieces of a much bigger strategic puzzle. As we continue executing on our mRNA strategy, you should expect to see more targeted activity in this area. Of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy. This is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals, they are marked as new in this slide. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women\u2019s health with [Technical Difficulty] I apologize for the technical issue. I will repeat my script for this last slide. And then, we go forward. So, of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy. This is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals, you can see them with the indication, new. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women\u2019s health with Biohaven's groundbreaking oral CGRP receptor antagonist, the only one approved in the U.S. for both acute and preventative treatment of migraine, so that we can potentially bring a valuable new treatment option to patients living with this debilitating neurological disease outside the U.S. And through the proposed acquisition of Arena we plan to leverage Pfizer\u2019s leading research and global development capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of etrasimod for patients with immunoinflammatory diseases. Now, I'd like to share some details about Pfizer\u2019s enhanced ESG strategy. The strategy is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful and measurable impact over the next decade: product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Each quarter going forward, I will provide examples of how we are embedding ESG into all core areas of our business. This quarter, I will highlight our efforts to improve clinical trial diversity, to improve diversity within our colleague base, and help ensure equitable access to our COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. Last year, Pfizer published an industry-first retrospective analysis of demographic data of U.S. participants in 213 of our interventional clinical trials that initiated enrollment from 2011 through 2020. The analysis demonstrated that overall trial participation of Black or African American individuals was at the U.S. census level, 14.3% versus 13.4%, participation of Hispanic or Latino individuals was below U.S. census, 15.9% versus 18.5%, and female participation was at U.S. census 51.1% versus 50.8%. We published this analysis to be transparent and for it to serve as a baseline as we measure progress in this area. We believe that diversity in trials is a matter of equity and good science and are taking decisive steps designed to improve diversity in our trials. Our goal is to achieve racially and ethnically diverse participation at or above U.S. census or disease prevalence levels as appropriate in all our trials. The second item I want to highlight is the significant progress we are making in diversifying our colleague base, particularly at more senior-level positions. In the last three years, for example, we have increased the percentage of women at the Vice President level and above globally from 32% to 42%. Over the same timeframe, we have increased the percentage of minorities at the Vice President level and above in the U.S. from 19% to 25%. The third item I wanted to highlight is the progress we are making to help ensure our COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment are accessible by everyone everywhere. I am thrilled to say that we remain on track to meet or exceed our goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of our vaccine to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022, having just met our goal of delivering the first 1 billion by the end of 2021. I also want to highlight two data points about our 2 billion-dose commitment. 1 billion of these doses are being provided to the poorest countries completely free of charge, thanks to our agreement with the U.S. government. Pfizer is providing these doses to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price, and the government is then providing them to the poorest countries for free. Also, the 1 billion doses we delivered in 2021 represented 37% of all doses we delivered this last year. In terms of our oral COVID-19 treatment, we have signed a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, which we hope will lead to expanded access pending country regulatory authorization or approval in 95 low- and middle-income countries that account for approximately 53% of the world\u2019s population. Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has been reviewing methods for linking executive compensation with ESG performance, which we expect to begin this year. For details regarding the impact of our ESG strategy had on our business in 2021, please keep an eye out for Pfizer\u2019s 2021 ESG Report, which will be published online in mid-March. In summary, 2021 was an outstanding year for Pfizer, and we look forward to continuing to apply the lessons learned from COVID to deliver breakthroughs for patients across all our therapeutic areas. We remain focused on being nimble, investing in our R&D organization and exploring dynamic partnerships that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. None of this is possible without the contributions of our amazingly purpose-driven colleagues, who continue to rise to the challenge of addressing the world\u2019s most devastating diseases. In 2021, our colleagues exceeded expectations. Therefore, we will once again use a part of the bonus pool that the Board approved for bonus-eligible colleagues and executives to provide a one-time special COVID-19 Circumstances Bonus to our non-bonus eligible colleagues across the board to reward them for their hard work and to help them cover personal, family and living expenses incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Frank will provide financial details on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2022. So Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Albert. I\u2019m delighted to share updates from this quarter as we continue to deliver first-in-class science. Today, I will share updates from our COVID-19 programs and select other assets in our pipeline. Let\u2019s start with Paxlovid. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to burden public health, we have advanced the science on our novel oral antiviral therapeutic. Importantly, we see consistent, potent antiviral activity in vitro against all current variants of concern, including both Delta and Omicron. This would be expected from how the compound was designed. On the left, you can see a crystal structure showing how tightly nirmatrelvir binds into the active site of the Omicron variant. History has told us from the HIV protease field that the closer the therapeutic is designed to mimic the substrate, the harder it is for resistance to emerge. That combined with the essential nature of the protease, the short duration of treatment and the co-dosing with ritonavir to drug exposures that are over 5x to 6x the amount of compound needed to kill the virus in an in vitro assay, suggests there is a reduced risk for resistance. External data support our findings. In this slide, the lower values, the stronger potency, illustrated by nirmatrelvir being on the low end of the Y axis on the left having the most potent activity. Nirmatrelvir maintains in vitro potency in the low nanomolar range, as you can see in these graphs that include other authorized or approved therapeutics. On the left is in vitro data from a study done with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Pfizer. Nirmatrelvir demonstrated potent antiviral activity as measured by IC50, a measure of drug efficacy indicating the concentration needed to inhibit infection by half. This is consistent with findings from the Rega Institute at KU Leuven in Belgium, shown on the right. We anticipate a New Drug Application decision by the FDA in the high-risk population in the second half of '22, pivotal readouts of our household contact and standard risk studies in the second quarter and second half of '22, respectively, and a study start in children 6 to 18 years old in the first quarter of '22. In the standard risk study, we are expanding enrollment by 750 non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19, and vaccinated, standard-risk patients may also be eligible, provided their last SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was received at least 12 months prior to screening. This expansion will allow us to further evaluate the secondary endpoint seen in the interim analysis, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization and no deaths in the treated compared to placebo. We also are advancing work on a potential next generation SARS-CoV antiviral with the aim of achieving similar high clinical efficacy and pan-Coronavirus design properties that maintain activity, with a favorable safety profile, and counter potential viral resistance but without the need for ritonavir boosting. A first in human study start is expected in the second half of '22. Now, we also continue to advance vaccine development and have achieved Emergency Use Authorization for use in children as young as age 5. Effectiveness data for three doses of the vaccine for people 12 years and older, and early laboratory data observed with Delta and other variants of concern, including Omicron, suggest that people vaccinated with three doses of Comirnaty may have a higher degree of protection against both symptomatic and severe outcomes compared to two primary doses. Informed by these data, in addition to the immunobridging data, we are evaluating a third 3-microgram dose in our study of children six months through four years of age, with the belief that a third dose may be optimal for this age group. However, as pediatric cases and hospitalizations are at an all-time high, FDA urged us to start a rolling Emergency Use Authorization submission with the two-dose efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data we have accumulated thus far while we continue to collect data, including from third-dose administration. We plan to submit third-dose data once available. In the meantime, FDA has scheduled an Advisory Committee meeting for February 15 to consider the two-dose suggested data collected to-date. If Emergency Use Authorization of two doses is granted and the CDC recommends usage, parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID-19 vaccination series for their children between 6 months and 4 years of age while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose. Turning to the adult population. In the wake of surging Omicron cases, in January we completed a laboratory analysis of the effect of a third dose boost of Comirnaty on live virus neutralization. Encouragingly, there was a more than 25-fold increase in Omicron live virus neutralizing titers observed between day of dose three and one month post-dose three. We observed a moderate 4-month post-dose three antibody decay for wild-type and Omicron variant. Between one month and four months post-dose three, neutralizing titers were 1.6- and 2-fold lower for wild-type and the Omicron variant, respectively. We\u2019re now starting to see effects of a third dose boost in maintaining a high level of protection against Omicron in the real world. These data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California show Omicron-related emergency department visits without hospitalization on top, and hospitalizations on the bottom. Three doses of COMIRNATY provided better vaccine effectiveness against Omicron than two doses, and there was high vaccine effectiveness of three doses against Omicron-related hospitalization, similar to Delta-related hospitalization. We did see some waning of effectiveness against emergency department admissions due to Omicron three months or more after a third dose, which suggests the potential need for another boost of the current vaccine or an Omicron-based vaccine. We have started an Omicron-based vaccine candidate trial in adults 18 to 55 years of age. This study will evaluate more than 1,400 participants across three cohorts: Those who have already received two doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one or two doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. Those who have already received three doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one dose of the current vaccine or the Omicron-based vaccine. And those who are vaccine-na\u00efve will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. This study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that we hope achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as the current vaccine has with both wild-type and earlier variants, but with potentially longer duration of protection. Now, let\u2019s turn to our next generation CDK inhibitors for cancer. Most patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer eventually develop resistance to both endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitors despite their transformative efficacy. Inhibition of CDK2, delivered with a CDK selective active drug or a triple activity CDK 2/4/6 agent, may prevent, delay, or reverse resistance and prolong survival. These are data from a subset in the CDK2/4/6 inhibitor Phase 1 dose escalation and antitumor activity study of heavily pre-treated patients with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer. The most improvement in terms of tumor size reduction was seen in patients treated with monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant. We observed three confirmed partial responses and three patients with stable disease for more than 12 months. One patient has been receiving ongoing treatment for more than 28 months. There has been an acceptable safety profile at the recommended Phase 2 dose, which is 25-milligram twice daily. We plan to conduct a Phase 1 dose expansion and expect to complete it in the fourth quarter of this year. Selective CDK2 inhibition with -- CDK2 only inhibitor may allow dose titration and has the potential to be used in combination with approved CDK inhibitors, such as palbociclib, or other next-generation CDK4 selective inhibitors. There were two confirmed partial responses in the Phase 1 study of our selective CDK2 inhibitor in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor/HER2 negative breast cancer who had received/progressed on prior CDK4/6 inhibition and endocrine therapy. One patient had a maximum tumor shrinkage of 54% following CDK2 inhibitor treatment for approximately 8 months, and the second had 100% shrinkage of all target lesions following treatment for approximately 9 months. We are showing scans of the first patient at baseline and 8 weeks. There was an acceptable safety profile as a monotherapy, and we are currently exploring combinations. We expect the Phase 1/2 study to be completed in the second quarter of '23. Now, let\u2019s turn to our six-valent Lyme disease vaccine candidate which we are developing in partnership with Valneva. 13 We have received further positive data from our Phase 2 proof of concept study and expect to start Phase 3 in the third quarter of 2022 with a dosing regimen of zero, 2, and 6 months to prime, followed by routine boosters before the start of a Lyme season. Our Phase 2 study is continuing and includes a pediatric population ages 5 to 17 years. Since Lyme disease is seasonal, our goal is to establish a regimen that results in high antibodies at the beginning of each season. We, therefore, looked at a boost one year after the primary series. We saw substantial boost antibody response in Phase 2 to all six serotypes present in North America and Europe following the three-dose primary series vaccination schedule, with a 14- to 31-fold rise in season one and a 51- to 69-fold rise in season two. The vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated at all dose levels tested, and we are excited about further development and the potential to help prevent this debilitating disease. Last quarter, we told you that we saw robust dystrophin expression out to one year in our Muscular Dystrophy gene therapy Phase 1b study. I will show you encouraging functional motor data in a moment. We recently shared some very sad news that a DMD patient with advanced disease in the non-ambulatory cohort of the Phase 1b trial passed away after presenting with hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock. This patient was 16 years old and the first in the non-ambulatory cohort treated with RAPAMUNE, along with steroids, as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. RAPAMUNE is not used in the Phase 3 ambulatory study. Like most non-ambulatory DMD patients, he had more advanced disease with underlying cardiac dysfunction. There is evidence of an active viral infection and we are investigating how this may have contributed to the outcome. Additional assessment will be required to define next steps needed to restart the Phase 1b study in non-ambulatory patients who are more progressed in the disease. I will now share data from this study. The ambulatory cohort -- sorry, I had one more sentence to say here. 19 patients were enrolled in this study, 16 of whom received the dose selected for our Phase 3 program and three of whom received a previously studied lower dose. At one year post-treatment, there was a 5.6 point improvement in ambulatory function as measured by North Star Ambulatory Assessment compared to an external control, matched for age and baseline function. This is particularly encouraging given that patients at this age and stage of disease typically experience a considerable decline in ambulatory function as illustrated by the external control. On the right, we show time in study, with six participants nearing or more than three years since treatment. The ambulatory cohort in Phase 1b is similar, but slightly older on average, to the population in the Phase 3 CIFFREO trial. Considering the favorable benefit to risk profile in this study and observed in ambulatory patient population and in consultation with the Data Monitoring Committee, we believe the safety profile of our DMD gene therapy is manageable in this patient group. Additional mitigations are being added to our study protocol in consultation with the DMC and other medical experts. Pending regulatory feedback, we anticipate Phase 3 study sites to begin to re-open in the next few months, with the potential to report topline results and, subject to clinical trial success, submit a BLA by the end of 2023. Turning now to Internal Medicine, and ponsegromab, our candidate for cachexia due to cancer. It targets GDF-15, which as seen is frequently elevated in cancer patients, drives reduction of appetite and body weight loss, and is associated with poor outcomes. There may also be potential to treat cachexia associated with other chronic diseases such as heart failure and COPD. We have encouraging Phase 1b data which I will show next. Ponsegromab was evaluated in 10 cancer patients who were undergoing anti-tumor treatment and had more than 5% body weight loss in the last 6 months, or more than 2% body weight loss with a body mass index of less than 20 kilogram per meters squared or diagnosed sarcopenia. Ponsegromab administration was found to suppress circulating GDF-15 levels in cancer cachexia patients below the level observed in healthy subjects. Preliminary data from the Phase 1b trial show ponsegromab treatment resulted in significant body weight gain compared to historical placebo. You can see the nice trend in body weight increase remained even after the dosing was stopped at week 12. The gray dotted line indicates the historical cut-off associated with improved survival. We are co-developing a companion diagnostic with Roche Diagnostics designed to enable precision medicine, and we expect to start a Phase 2 study in cancer cachexia in the fourth quarter of this year. Injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists offer potent lowering of glucose and weight in diabetic and obese patients, with proven cardiovascular benefit, but this drug class is underutilized due to its injectable administration route. Our small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist danuglipron could potentially offer a convenient oral alternative to injectables and is being evaluated for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, obesity and NASH. It has been developed in our Internal Medicine Research Group with a vision to expand the use of this potent, easily administrated GLP-1 drug class to a primary care setting. Here are data from the Phase 2 study in Type 2 Diabetes. We recorded strong dose-dependent reductions in both HbA1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels and body weight, compared to the marginal effects noted with placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment with the 200 milligram twice daily dose, HbA1c decreased by almost 1.6% and body weight decreased by 5.4 kilograms. The safety and tolerability profile is consistent with the GLP-1 class and the most frequent adverse event rates were GI-related. We expect to start a Phase 2b titration optimization study mid-'22 with doses up to 200 milligram twice a day, and complete a Phase 2b study in non-diabetic subjects with obesity in the first quarter of next year. Finally, here are select recent and upcoming milestones from across the pipeline. The solid blue dots represent milestones achieved and the open blue dots represent anticipated milestones. Programs in bold are major anticipated events. Some of the programs on the right have already been designated as lightspeed, meaning they have accelerated development timelines, or are being considered for lightspeed designation. Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank Morrie Birnbaum, our outgoing Chief Scientific Officer of the Internal Medicine Research Unit, for his immense contributions over the last seven years, and welcome Bill Sessa, who joins us from Yale School of Medicine following a decades-long career in academia, including serving as Vice Chair of Pharmacology, Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Vascular Biology & Therapeutics Program at Yale. Bill is an eminent leader in this field, a groundbreaking scientist and a celebrated innovator, and I know he will bring his tremendous vision and insights to our investigation of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions. Now, let me turn it over to Frank.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Thanks, Mikael. I know you\u2019ve seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine once again had a positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert and Mikael have already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement. Revenue increased 106% operationally in the fourth quarter of '21 driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue excluding the COVID-19 vaccine direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid contribution, the fourth quarter was slower than the first nine months of the year, declining by 2% operationally. As we discussed during our third quarter call, there was a 4% negative impact, or approximately $500 million, from fewer selling days in the U.S. and International. Excluding that impact, operational growth would have been 2%, which is still lower than the mid-to-high single-digit growth we had experienced during the rest of the year. This was factored into our forecasts for the year but let me briefly walk you through this. In our Biopharma business, you will remember that the fourth quarter of '21 faced a tough comp from the fourth quarter of 2020 for Prevnar, as pneumococcal vaccinations were strong ahead of COVID-19 vaccine availability. Excluding vaccines from the current and comparable period would add 5 percentage points to the growth. Adjusting for the unusual comparative period differences related to vaccines and selling days, our revenue growth would have been approximately 7%, which is similar to what we've been delivering lately. For the year, operational revenue growth was 92%. Excluding Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid, 2021 operational revenue growth was 6%. This is consistent with our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly and annual growth rates due to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least a 6% CAGR through 2025. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced this quarter\u2019s gross margin by approximately 16 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the fourth quarter increased primarily due to increased product-level spending, including Comirnaty and higher healthcare reform sales-based fees. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter was primarily driven by increased investments in late-stage pipeline projects, including additional spending related to our oral COVID-19 treatment. [Technical Difficulty]\nAlbert Bourla: Frank, I think you were disconnected.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Chris?\nChris Stevo: Yes. We can hear you, Frank. Go ahead.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Okay. I'm not sure I left off, but I think what I'll do is start with the '22 financial guidance. So we\u2019ve again provided total-company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. We will continue to provide insight into our expected revenues for Comirnaty, and, now for the first time, we will also provide some color on our expected revenues for Paxlovid. However, note that we will no longer be providing EPS guidance for the business excluding Comirnaty. Similarly, we won't provide EPS guidance for Paxlovid. Our revenue guidance represents a record for Pfizer, and we expect total company revenue to be in a range of $98 billion to $102 billion, representing an operational growth rate of 24% at the mid-point. Please consider that this revenue range reflects approximately $1.1 billion of anticipated negative impact from changes in foreign currencies and also the impact of the loss of Meridian's sales of approximately $300 million, both of which your models may not take into account. Regarding our COVID-related revenues, we now expect the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion compared to our prior guidance provided on December 17. For Paxlovid, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion. This means that excluding the COVID-related revenues, we expect sales to be $46 billion at the midpoint, representing operational growth of 5%. While this is slightly below the 6% CAGR that we continue to expect between 2020 and 2025, I would remind you that there will be volatility along the way. Let me give you some detail on our cost and expense guidance. For adjusted cost of sales, we are expecting a range of 32.2% to 34.2%. Given that we are now more than 12 months past the launch of Comirnaty, we expect its negative impact on our cost of sales margins to be less than it was in 2021, assuming a similar level of revenues. Further, Paxlovid is expected to have a very positive impact on cost of sales as a percent of revenues in 2022. On adjusted SI&A, we expect $12.5 to $13.5 billion, an increase of $900 million at the midpoint. We expect our adjusted R&D guidance range to be $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion at the midpoint that is about $500 million higher than last year. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the year somewhat higher than 2021 at approximately 16%. These assumptions yield an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.35 to $6.55 or 47% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021, excluding an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. I would like to point out some additional information which may be helpful for your models. You will note that our guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 5.8 billion which represents an increase of approximately 100 million shares over 2021. This accounts for the number of shares that we normally issue for employee compensation annually. The increase of 100 million shares over 2021 decreases our EPS by about $0.10 at the mid-point. I notice that most of your models instead assume a flat share count for 2022 as compared to 2021. From the first quarter of 2022 and going forward, we've made a decision to modify our adjusted financials' treatment of amortization of intangibles. Previously, we only excluded amortization related to large mergers and acquisitions. Now exclude all intangible asset amortization expense, this is anticipated to contribute $0.6 to our 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share, and helps improve comparability with our peers. 2022 guidance once again assumes no share repurchases. You will note that Pfizer did not repurchase shares in either 2020 or 2021. While we continue to have outstanding unused authorization to repurchase another $5.3 billion of stock and can be opportunistic, given the potentially value-enhancing business development opportunities which are available to us, we do not expect to repurchase shares in 2022. Now a word on our 32% stake in the Consumer JV with GSK. As you know, GSK has announced its intention to engage in a demerger transaction for at least 80% of its 68% stake in the JV in summer 2022. We talked about our stake as a non-core asset whose value we will seek to realize over time. While we have determined neither the manner nor timing of how we will do so, there are a number of possible alternatives and we will attempt to monetize this asset in the manner which will create the most value for our shareholders. We receive approximately $600 million in pre-tax income from the JV annually, and this will not change as a result of the demerger transaction, and our guidance assumes that this will continue throughout 2022 with no change to our 32% stake. Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions and context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split. Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 4 billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The $1 billion increase in expected COVID vaccine revenues to approximately $32 billion in 2022 primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-December, which was the cutoff for our prior guidance. While we can\u2019t predict what may be needed due to omicron or other variants, I would also caution you that there is less potential upside to this guidance through the year, compared to the situation we faced in 2021 when the vaccine was newly available and few people had received any doses of the vaccine. As you will remember, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses and payment to -- representing 50% gross profit and split. We expect that, the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to the slightly higher than the high twenties as a percentage of revenue that we had in 2021. Unlike the situation for Comirnaty demand for Paxlovid should have upside from these levels, depending on the outcomes of discussions with certain governments and potential purchases for stockpiling against future coronavirus pandemics. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid contribution from both periods, you'll see that we expect at the 2020 to 2022 revenue range to be $45 billion to $47 billion, representing approximately 5% operational revenue growth at the midpoint. Please remember our guidance excludes the former revenue contribution of approximately $300 million to Meridian, and all '21 quarters have been recast to exclude Meridian is discontinued operations, accounting for its divestiture. Going forward, we will not give earning guidance, excluding the estimated income from our Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid. However, to help you with your forecasting, a couple of minutes ago, I gave you my view on 2022 Comirnaty pre-tax margins. For Paxlovid, I would think about its margins as being typical for a small molecule drug, and unlike Comirnaty, it is expected to not be dilutive to pre-tax margins. To help you further, several years ago before COVID-19 existed, I spoke about our business being on a path back to a 40% plus pre-tax margin and we expect to achieve this level in 2022 for the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Going forward we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide. In summary, an exceptionally strong quarter and year based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. During the year, we raised guidance, and for the year, we met or exceeded our guidance in all key metrics. Our pipeline continues to advance, and we have invested record amounts to support that advance. Last week, Arena's shareholders voted to approve Pfizer's acquisition of the Company. We look forward to a targeted closing of the Arena acquisition as soon as the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, including antitrust approvals. We continue to expect to be active in regards to business development throughout 2022, as we continue to get access to the best external science and bring breakthroughs to patients in 2025 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Frank. Apologies everyone for those technical difficulties. Just want to remind you, we do have the prepared remarks posted to the website. So, if there's anything you missed because of the difficulties, please refer to the prepared remarks, and given the technical difficulties, we're going to try to let the Q and a session run a little longer to answer people's questions. First question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Securities.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had two. The first one, Paxlovid guidance, I know you guys are factoring in only signed agreements, but can you give us a general sense as to agreements or doses perhaps that are under discussion, and is that dependent on supply ramping? The second question, on external BD Albert, I understand the strategy. I think the uncertainty is really the ability to scale some of the products that you brought in. So, if COVID-19 is less of a long-term contributor than you assume, what\u2019s the appetite to do higher impact larger deals? You clearly have the capacity. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Angela, do you want to take a little bit of Paxlovid?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. So, currently, we are in active discussions with over 100 countries and governments around the world. So, I\u2019d say that the discussions are going really well. In terms of where we are with the contracting, as you say, we\u2019ve included some of the contracts that we already are -- that we have. But, of course, this number changes every day. And contracts are being secured and distribution agreements being secured literally on a day-to-day basis. So, I think that this is a number to watch out for. And we do continue to expect movement. I think that there is a tremendous amount of interest for our product. And certainly, as the clinical program continues to develop and emerge, as you know, we only have the high-risk study right now, we still have the standard risk and the prophylaxis that\u2019s coming up, and I think that the full clinical program will also be another point of impetus for contracting and ordering. So, I think it\u2019s going just really well and more to come on this front.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Aamir, maybe some comments on the BD.\nAamir Malik: Sure. Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think in terms of the top line, we\u2019re going to be incredibly flexible. We have said repeatedly that we are most interested in compounds that have potential to be real breakthroughs, and this can take the form of later-stage clinical development as well as earlier stage medical innovation. We\u2019re going to bias to the Tas, oncology, I&I, rare, vaccines, internal medicine and hospital, where we\u2019ve got the scientific chops to make good choices and add real value. And we\u2019re going to be flexible on the deal types. Acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards, but strategic partnerships and alliances are well. And, in fact, some of our best successes have come from some capital-light collaborations. If we see a larger opportunity that\u2019s strategic and creates value and meets the criteria that I just described, we\u2019ve obviously got the balance sheet to utilize to do that. So, we certainly will look at those, but we\u2019re going to talk about and focus on the priorities that I described more so than synergy driven deals per se.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Aamir, and just to add to both points because I\u2019m sure that both will be asked a lot. On the Paxlovid, clearly, the numbers could become way bigger than what we have right now, but this is not something that we have done in the past and we don\u2019t plan to do right now to give based on what could be the potential as a guidance. We are giving guidance based on what it is more or less secure. However, signed deals are already agreed, but not signed yet deals, but agreed prices and volumes. So, clearly, if you remember, when we started with the vaccine, in the beginning, we had a guidance of, I think, $15 billion in the first quarter, something like that. Eventually, made $36 billion. Here, we start even stronger in our first projections with Paxlovid. So and that\u2019s why we manufacture and we\u2019ll move ahead with our plans and already we are at 120 million treatments and we have the ability to go higher if the discussions that we\u2019re having materialize. In terms of also the business development, I just want to emphasize that -- because I\u2019m getting a lot this question on the size. We are agnostic to size. Where we are biased, it is deals. But in order to justify the premium, we will have to do significant cost synergies. This is not -- these are -- could be very profitable deals for other, let\u2019s say, periods of the history of the Company, not now. Right now, the Company is having a manufacturing machine, but it is performing at its best, an R&D machine, but it\u2019s performing at its best, a commercial machine, but keeps being the leader in the industry in terms of their ability to execute and deliver. So, the last thing I want to do, it is to do a deal, but in order to justify the premium to the shareholders of the other company, we will have to shut down manufacturing sites and to consolidate the shared sites and consolidate field forces, so that we can justify, so we can generate the core synergies. This is not the time to disrupt the momentum of the Company. This is a time to bring into this manufacturing machine, the research machine, the commercial machine more substrate in addition to what we produce organically ourselves. And this is why the business development is aiming in these areas. So, let\u2019s go to the next one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on Paxlovid. So, there have been some news reports talking about logisticals and access issues for Paxlovid. And I understand the supply is tight for now, but would love to get your thoughts on how you\u2019re working on improving the logistics when the supply is no longer an issue, especially in a world where home testing would become a norm and one needs to take this drug within five days of diagnostics. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: I wouldn\u2019t say that we have logistical issues of supply. But, Angela, would you like to take that, please?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. So first of all, again, our deliveries and our allocations for the doses have gone extremely well here in the U.S. Just to give you some context, 265,000 doses have been allocated by the U.S. government since the EUA was approved. And of that 265,000, 85% of all the doses have been ordered. So and we see a range of ordering patterns from the states. Some states are ordering 100% of the allocation, others are 80%, 70%, so on and so forth. So, it is really only a handful that haven\u2019t really ordered up to their allocation. But I would say, for the most part, the weekly orders are going up and increasing week by week. And there is a very strong placement of orders. So, I would say that the drawdown right, of the doses and the utilization is going really well. And again, it differs by state what the allocations are and how that\u2019s going. And then, as Albert said, I don\u2019t know that we have logistical -- like, they are not logistical issues. I think, initially, what was difficult was that it was not clear where the doses were being located because every state had a different system for where to actually distribute Paxlovid from. But there are a number of tools now that have gone up online, both at the state level as well as on Pfizer\u2019s website. We\u2019ve taken the state government tool and also loaded it on our website, so that both HCPs and patients can see where Paxlovid is being -- where it\u2019s available and where the orders as well as prescription can be placed. So, I think in that regard, that\u2019s all been ironed out. I think looking forward into the future, clearly, having a seamless sort of end-to-end, from diagnosis, positive results to then being able to prescribe quickly and having the patient be able to acquire the drug quickly is our goal. And I think, on all of those fronts, we\u2019re working with a number of partners both from a testing and a diagnostics perspective, but also from a telemedicine perspective and from a pharmacy perspective, to ensure that we have as fast and as efficient, I can say, a patient journey, right from diagnosis right until treatment. So, all of that is in place. And you\u2019ll continue to hear more about that as the launch and as the utilization increases.\nAlbert Bourla: So, again, to punctuate and give a little bit of context to what Angela said, the 85% that -- it has already been ordered from the quantity that we are making available to U.S. government. It\u2019s a very, very high number. For example, the same number in the first month for vaccines, if you remember well, if you remember from that time, was dramatically lower than that because it takes time for the states to get their act together and it is really variable state by state. So, there are states right now, but once the quantities are made to them available, they are ordering immediately and there are states that take their time until they get their act together for the distribution. In general, way, way, way more efficient than what used to be in the first months of the vaccine, also, what is extremely important, it is that every week, there is constant replenishments, which although we do not have right now, data for scripts, because it\u2019s too early, what we do have it is that the quantities that the states are accumulating, they\u2019re disappearing and then immediately they are placing orders. So, I would say we have, let\u2019s say -- we are pretty happy with the way that the first month, the collaboration with the U.S. government went in terms of allocating doses. And there is dramatically also improvement in the tools, as Angela described. But the bigger improvement will come from the fact that the second month, we will make available way more quantities, and the third month, way more quantities because the issues right now for people trying to find it, it is in few places in the state because you can\u2019t expand the network of places that it is variable when you have smaller quantities. That will be very, very different in this month and basically all over the place, I think, in the third month where significant quantities will be delivered. Okay. I think let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the FTC review process for the Arena deal. If I\u2019m not mistaken, there was a recent procedural move where you and Arena withdrew and re-filed the HSR Act filing essentially to allow the FTC an additional 30 days for review. And then, I\u2019d also love for you to walk me through your assumptions on how you forecast $13 billion in revenue from BD transactions that would imply to your specific targets and combination of targets in mind. Any color here that you could provide would be very helpful. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you very much. On the last one, just to make sure, but this is not our assumption. Our assumption is way higher of the $13 billion. What I just gave you, it is what is the consensus of the deals that we have signed so far. But on the FTC review, I would like to ask Doug to provide maybe a review on that, Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.\nDoug Lankler: Yes. As you pointed out, we did request to refile, which is not unusual. Under -- the deal is, of course, subject to customary closing conditions and typical anti-trust clearance and shareholder approval, which, as you know, we\u2019ve received. We don\u2019t expect a significant break in time from our proposed sense that the deal will close in the first half of this year. We still expect it to close in the first half of this year.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. And Aamir, although I did explain that this is consensus numbers, not our numbers, do you want to make any other comment on the $13 billion of 2030 revenues that consensus forecasts for the deals that we have signed?\nAamir Malik: Yes. The only thing I would add is, we feel very good about the progression of all of the substrate and the deals since 2019 that Albert outlined. We\u2019ve seen a significant number of approvals in the EUAs in that group, submissions as well as quite a few Phase 3 starts. So we think that that substrate is progressing well and the $13 billion is the consensus number. Our expectations of what\u2019s there are materially higher and there are a number of transactions. We spoke to Trillium, Biohaven and even some of the recent things that we\u2019ve done in mRNA that are not yet factored in the consensus forecast on those transactions.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Perhaps two on vaccines today, if I may. First, on the flu vaccine. I know you\u2019ve had a trial ongoing on your mod RNA since September. And I noticed you just initiated a new trial of a self-amplifying mRNA for flu. And I wonder if the decision to progress a second mRNA program in flu was triggered by any emerging data from your first-gen flu Phase 1 that\u2019s been ongoing. And then, secondly, on the Omicron-specific booster, perhaps in light of some of the emerging data on immunogenicity differences or lack thereof versus regular COVID-19 vaccines. I guess my question is, what\u2019s your confidence on ability to show superiority of an Omicron-specific booster versus regular and what would be the regulatory criteria? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Thank you very much. I think Mikael can take the question. On the flu vaccines, just to make sure what I clarify, the plan was always to initiate an mRNA for flu and a round of two programs entirely. It\u2019s not that we show data that forced us to do SI&A. It was always the plan. We are advancing new forms of mRNA technology in SA. It is one of the most promising next-generation of RNA technologies. But Mikael, any comments on that and on the Omicron-specific -- our confidence for superiority?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you. Yes, we are accumulating, first of all, from our mod mRNA data trial, data on various regimens and on multivalent constructs. We remain of the view that we aspire to develop a flu vaccine. Currently, the most aggressive timelines are focused on the mod mRNA. Our plans is to develop something that has a differentiation versus the current tetravalent standard of care. I know other companies have spoken about being similar, while at this moment we still see opportunities to possibly differentiate with an mRNA-based or mod mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we are actually filing the IND for the self-amplified. I think, the protocol may have gone up already on ClinicalTrials.gov, but dosing is going to be within the next couple of months or so. And it\u2019s entirely based on us aiming to develop that platform, which has particular relevance for combinations vaccine, given that possibly we expect to have much lower mRNA burden and can over time build vaccine combination of several different pathogens. We\u2019ll keep you updated on progress with the mod mRNA flu and we certainly see data that suggests that this is a feasible path and we are working to refine our approach to aim for a differentiated vaccine.\nAlbert Bourla: What about Omicron and how confident we are about the superiority?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. The regulatory path is that we expect to have a -- if successful, an Omicron boost would show higher neutralizing antibodies for Omicron versus a similar boost by the Wild Type vaccine and acceptable titers to the other previously available strains to preserve broad protection, but possibly with higher Omicron. I really think we showed. Let the science play out here. We are talking about a number of weeks before we get data. And as alluded to, it has three different arms on top of three doses, Omicron versus Wild Type, that was on top of three previous doses, on top of two previous vaccine doses, one or two Omicron, that will be very interesting data set, and then Omicron on naive. So, I think it\u2019s a really interesting trial and we\u2019ll extract a lot of data and we\u2019ll report whether we can get that superiority. But in any case, I would just want to punctuate that our current vaccine is active of the three doses and raise relevant neutralizing antibodies. And the T-cell responses that we see are likely the one that contribute in real world evidence to provide effective protection of the current vaccine against hospitalization and death. Omicron vaccine is an interesting opportunity that we\u2019ll learn more about. But our science is progressing against several dimensions on how to further improve over time mRNA vaccines, although they\u2019re all pretty good ones. So, you should expect Pfizer continue to be a leader in this field through multiple approaches, together with BioNTech.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question for you is, what are the key pushes and pulls to your underlying business excluding COVID? And what gives you confidence that you can still meet that top-line sales guidance that you gave through 2025 despite some of the volatility that we\u2019re seeing right now? And then, just wanted to ask you on your TL1A antibody and where you are with development of that product and the reporting of data? Have you changed any of the timelines for when you report data? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. On the 6%, what gives us confidence, it is that we are -- we keep meeting the goal. As I said that we set the goal in \u201919 for a 6% all the way CAGR. And then, we had -- year-to-date, we are at 6% right now. The year particularly it is at 5% for the underlying business. But there is a little bit of volatility, but always we knew that this will be a year that we are losing some of the revenues of CHANTIX compared to previous year, which affects quite significant this deal, which then, as we are launching new products, they are coming up. Maybe I will ask Angela to give a little bit more details on the inputs and how this is progressing and also Mikael on the antibody question. Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Thank you, Louise. I think the 6% confidence is really driven by two things. First of all, the launches, right, that will take place between now and 2025, which will continue to drive growth for us. But also importantly, in our in-line portfolio, Louise, every single one of our products still have opportunities to grow. They can grow from a number of different ways, right? There is still under-diagnosed patients. So, from new diagnosis, you can continue to drive a tremendous amount of growth in Eliquis and in Vyndaqel. In many of our products, we still have class growth. Think about the CDK4/6s, think about Xtandi, think about Braf/Mektovi. These are all therapies that are still, I think, underutilized from a class perspective. So, there\u2019s growth there. And then finally, for all of them, there is the opportunity to grow in terms of market share, just given just the strong clinical profile and strong lifecycle support that we have for all of our product. So, I think we see tremendous amount of growth still. We just have not tapped out of growth in our core in-line brands. And then, you add on top of that, the launch brands. This is where we\u2019re going to get our growth from.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Angela. On the TL1A, as you remember, the previous earnings call, we showed some really strong data in the range of 34% endoscopic improvement and, with a biomarker, 48% in patients way above expected standard of care. That trial has enrolled very fast. It\u2019s fully enrolled. Full trial readout will be Q4. We are obviously considering based on the encouraging data in the previous trial opportunity for interim analysis that pending data could allow us to accelerate development of the program to its potential pivotal study. So, all in, it\u2019s moving very well and very fast.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you very much. Just to be absolutely clear, I understand that Pfizer wants to be conservative on Paxlovid, but it seems that Pfizer has merely scratched the surface on its 2022 potential and that scratching of the surface is what\u2019s in 2022 Paxlovid guidance. So, please just tell me if you disagree with that statement. Secondly, and just to be clear once again, do you not see growth for Pfizer overall in \u201925 through \u201930 without business development? And then, lastly, on danuglipron, Slide 39 shows some very good data. I\u2019m curious what was the discontinuation rate in the study? Can the dose be increased further? And does Pfizer expect additional weight loss beyond 12 weeks? Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. So, let me take the two first questions and then Mikael can take the research one. Look, it\u2019s not that we are giving conservative guidance. What we do, we have principles that we follow because otherwise you can be lost. And the principles that we are following, it is that we are only giving guidance for contracts that have been signed or they are very close to be signed because we have agreed critical terms predominantly. So, this is what you have heard about Paxlovid. Clearly, this is only a very small fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture and it is a small fraction of things that we are discussing right now around -- with different governments. But we are not taking, for example, an approach that we take all the discussions that we\u2019re having with the different governments, we risk-adjust them to see how many things can go part through and then we give a guidance. This is not what we do. We only give, and this is the same with the vaccines, things that have been signed or are really agreed by the time -- in a specific deadline. And I think, Frank said it was last week, I think, this deadline. So, clearly, there is a lot of potential, but it is not that we are putting a little bit of our own conservatism in the numbers. We are following a principle, so that we can always be clear with what we say and why we say. So, that\u2019s the -- then what about the study dose and the 12 weeks delay, Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: On the danuglipron, I\u2019m pleased that you were happy and impressed with our data. And indeed, I would say the glucose lowering through HbA1c and the body weight deductions are probably among the best in such a short treatment period. Tolerability and discontinuation rates improved versus previous study because we extended the dose titration from two weeks. And overall, safety, adverse events, I think, are very much in line with what you see comparable titration approaches with injectables. Given that we see that we can improve tolerability and discontinuations with this medium titration rate, we have the next studies coming up with a further slow dose titration, maybe up to a month or so, and we think that may even bring readouts of efficacy further above this. So, we are very pleased with the profile. And I think the next study will nail down for us dose regimen and will help us to move with a strong profile into a potential pivotal study.\nAlbert Bourla: All right. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A few questions. The RSV vaccine data previously said early \u201922, now you\u2019re saying first half \u201922, does that imply there has been some slippage because early to me, I always felt that meant January, February, something like that. mRNA flu, second question, what\u2019s a realistic timeframe for potential regulatory filing of a product like that, assuming you find success in your trials? And then, last question, Ibrance, sales soft. You say it\u2019s due to patient assistant programs. We haven\u2019t seen that impact, other CDK4/6s. And I haven\u2019t generally heard about those programs impacting other brands, either at Pfizer or other companies. So, I\u2019m wondering what else may be putting pressure on Ibrance. Are you having to cut price to maintain access?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. What was your question on flu vaccine?\nTim Anderson: A realistic timeframe for filing for approval of the mRNA flu vaccine.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you. Thank you. So, why don\u2019t we go -- Mikael, what about RSV? If you can speak about both. We have both now, adult and maternal. And then the mRNA. And then, Angela, if you speak about Ibrance.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. On the RSV, we have enrolled very well maternal and adult, and are basically, I would say, fully enrolled. So, it\u2019s entirely to ensure we have the number of events that we were looking for. And we expect both trials to readout, whether it\u2019s somewhere between Q1, Q2 or at a later part of Q2, we\u2019ll just see and as events accumulate, but it\u2019s going very well. So, I feel very optimistic with RSV study to conclude and we\u2019re looking forward to that data. MRNA flu, we are right now accumulating ingenuity from several different type of dose regimens. And if we are able to conclude with an optimal dose regimen using the mod mRNA, a potential Phase 2/Phase 3 study could certainly be initiated this year, but of course it\u2019s a little bit early to speculate before you have identified the right Phase 2/3 dose regimen. If we would embark on such a study this year, we expect it can conclude very fast, given our experience to run very large trials in this sector and this population of adults. And so, we\u2019re talking about possible conclusion then within next year. But it\u2019s, I would say, one step at a time. We\u2019ll keep you informed. We are encouraged so far. And we\u2019ll go from there.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And then, what about, Angela, on the Ibrance?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. I can confirm that the patient assistance program is indeed the primary reason for the decline in volume that you\u2019ve seen on Ibrance. Just to give you some perspective, in Q4 of 2021, our PAP prescriptions were up 32% compared to where it was in Q4 of 2020. And all of this is 53% more than what it was pre-COVID. And so, this is really what has cost us a tremendous amount of paid prescriptions. And that\u2019s really the primary reason. We also saw, and throughout the year, and this has been something that we\u2019ve been watching quarter-over-quarter, just some slowdown in a new patient starts. And -- but we\u2019ve seen this sort of phenomenon across multiple products in our portfolio. So there\u2019s a small contribution from that. But the largest contribution by far is truly this phenomenon we\u2019re seeing here in terms of PAPs\nAlbert Bourla: Thanks, Angela. Before we move to the next question, I realize that I didn\u2019t answer one of the questions that Steve made, Steve Scala, about if we believe that we need business development to grow in the period \u201925 to \u201930. And clearly this is not the belief right now. We think that we have a clear LOE number that we estimate around $17 billion. And we have a pipeline that delivers more than the LOEs. So, only organically, with what we have right now, in our calculations, we are at positive growth trajectory. The $25 billion I just mentioned needs to be on top of everything, the balance between LOEs and different funds like that, everything new but will be invented in the meantime, and of course, the COVID trajectory through 2030. But we don\u2019t need right now business development at all to grow. What we need business development is to maintain high level of 6% growth top-line, all the way through 2030, for example. Let\u2019s go now to the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. Couple of questions. First, what are your expectations that you\u2019ll need two shots of Omicron as opposed to one? The reason I ask is recently published animal models suggest that one Omicron mRNA vaccine actually generates lower levels of neutralizing antibody against Omicron than the ancestral spike variants, presumably due to antigenic sin. It obviously has implications for both revenues in terms of two shots but also compliance. And then, second, perhaps you could comment on the outlook for CD47 and talk to the differences between your molecule and Gilead\u2019s, which obviously has run into some safety issues with trial suspensions. Many thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. I will take the first one very quickly so that I can give time to Mikael to speak about the second one. Look, we have to wait to see the result, but I don\u2019t think it is all mRNA vaccines are the same, so I don\u2019t think we should extrapolate preclinical data for one effort to what will be the clinical, let\u2019s say, results of the other effort. We are testing both; one shot, we are testing two shots, and we are testing pretty soon hybrid vaccines, but everything what we have seen so far give us confidence that we will have a very strong reaction and immunogenicity of the an Omicron against Omicron. But, of course, that\u2019s based on preclinical. We need to wait see the first clinical data so that this assumption can be validated. With that, Mikael, what about Gilead? And by the way also, Andrew, you said what about your expectations. Our expectations are not based on one shot or two shots or five shots. Our expectation, as I said, it is contracts signed as for last week with Comirnaty. So what we\u2019ll sign further on will be in addition to whatever we have given so far. Mikael, on the Gilead?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. The interest in our product from Trillium was triggered by its unique design. It is what we call receptor fusion blocker protein in contrast to magrolimab that you referred to that\u2019s on hold, the Gilead antibody, it binds with a lower affinity to the target. And that was by purpose to allow it particularly to accumulate on high-expressing cancer cells and less accumulate on red blood cells to cause -- not to cause anemia or hemolytic anemia. And indeed, in our studies that have generated proof of concept, we have seen single-agent activity in blood cancers with basically negligible effect on red blood cells. So this is playing well out. We do not know why magrolimab is on clinical hold, but of course this differentiation that we have in our molecule may be one example of why our molecule has been doing so well this far. While we initially focus on lymphoid malignancies of the B-cell type, we think we also may become increasingly interested to go to the myeloid space where magrolimab has been, AML and MDS, particularly if our profile now may be superior and we\u2019re waiting readout from such studies also. So, for us, the Trillium deal is delivering on all what we expected and may actually have upside due to its more unique profile.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks much for the questions. Maybe just two to start with on just some clarifications around guidance, I know you\u2019re not giving a lot of details around core versus COVID-related earnings this year, but there\u2019s a lot of questions on that front. But if I just take the low end of your sales range at $45 billion, apply a 40% margin, tax-adjust that, I think I\u2019m getting a number somewhere around $2.60 per share at the low end. Is there any issues with that math I\u2019m doing? Or am I in the right ballpark there if I just want to think about a low end of core guidance for this year? My second question was on Paxlovid, and you\u2019re referencing here typical small molecule, I guess, gross margins for this one. Just help us frame that a bit more. I guess, is something in the mid-80s a reasonable level to think about for gross margins for this product or is it substantially higher or lower? I\u2019m just trying to better understand profitability to maybe think about some of these contracts coming forward in this year and maybe that Paxlovid number moving. And then, just the final one just to wrap up. I\u2019m still trying to get my hands around the BD side of the business and kind of the approach. I guess, should we be thinking about a significantly different approach to business development for Pfizer today versus what the Company was doing two or three years ago prior to the COVID upside? Or is this more just a continuation of, I guess, the focus and what you\u2019re looking at if we\u2019re thinking back to like 2019 as an example? Thanks so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. I\u2019ll take very quickly the third one and then Frank can take the first two questions. I wouldn\u2019t -- I would say, it is a continuation but with a way more accelerated pace. I don\u2019t think we are changing what we\u2019re saying since 2019. We are going into the science, as Aamir said. We are going into areas that we think we\u2019ll make fewer mistakes in selecting the right targets. We will be more successful, so we will be able to meet at least the success rates of the industry. Our aim is to exceed them as we\u2019re selecting assets. We prefer to go to areas that we can add value and there are significant areas that we can add value by becoming the preferred partner of several biotechs. And also, we have seen, as Aamir said, that some of the best deals we have done were not the most capital-intensive deals, right? So, there are -- so all of that, we are learning, we are not going to relax the discipline that we\u2019re having in selecting, but we are going to intensify a lot our activity in that area because, of course, we think that now is the time science is at a stage that we can find enough targets to be able to add value and create value. So that\u2019s on the BD side. Now, Frank, a lot of financial questions for margins, guidance, etc.\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Sure. So, Chris, on the walk through you did on, I\u2019ll call it, the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, I would use the midpoint on the revenue. You used, I think, a 40% income before tax margin. Then you got to tax-effect that. I didn\u2019t hear you say tax-effect it. So, if you do the math, you do the walk through and then you tax effect it, obviously dividing that by shares outstanding. That will give you, I think, a number that\u2019s in the ballpark. On Paxlovid gross margin, let me answer the question this way. One, we don\u2019t give margin information by individual product, right? It\u2019s something that, for many reasons, we don\u2019t do. But the way to think about it is, one, that the income before tax margin on that, the margin profile is similar to our other solid oral dose products. And remember, when you look at the gross margin, there\u2019s going to be SI&A investment in Paxlovid this year because we\u2019re launching that product. There\u2019s additional R&D investment in product that year because we\u2019re continuing obviously to evolve that product. All of that obviously is captured in the income before tax margin on that business, which is similar to our other solid oral dose products. It\u2019s all factored in our guidance. The one place where you can really see the impact, and hopefully this is helpful, you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue last year, for the full year, 37.7%. If you look at our guidance this year, 32.2% to 34.2%, the midpoint is 33.2%. That\u2019s down, at the midpoint, 4.5%, most of which is being driven by the Paxlovid revenue this year. So maybe that\u2019s the way to help you in terms of just how to work the numbers.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Frank. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. Two questions. One, again, just to make sure I understand clearly the thinking about what underpins the intermediate growth expectation through \u201925. I believe, when that was originally issued back in 2019, that did not assume contribution from business development to achieve that CAGR of 6% to \u201925. Is that still the case? That would be the first question. And then, the second question relates to Paxlovid. We have the standard risk study that you\u2019ve modified expanding. Can you talk about what kind of result we would need to see in order to influence the kinds of decisions and discussions that Angela is having with governments, in particular, the primary endpoint which just missed statistical significance on the alleviation of symptoms. Do you need to hit that? Or are the discussions being guided around the ability to meet the secondary endpoint, which was the decreased risk of hospitalizations and severe disease from that standard risk study? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Maybe I can take both in the interest of time. I can confirm that our guidance of 6% was excluding BD. So that was from \u201919 all the way to \u201925, 6% CAGR, from the things that we had at the time. As regards the standard risk primary endpoint, I think most of the governments, if not all, they are focusing right now all their purchases and their discussions that they\u2019re having on the ability to reduce hospitalization. And by the way, most of the -- I mean, FDA, for example, has already approved vaccinated and unvaccinated, which is included -- that means that includes also people that were in the standard risk population because the high-risk population were all unvaccinated. So, if we go -- the standard risk, I think, will contribute, but I think everybody is moving with the assumption that we give it to all people to prevent hospitalization. That\u2019s the main thing that everybody is looking. Now, the in-house contact, this is a very different that can change very much the landscape. There are no discussions around that right now. But if it comes positive, clearly that could be used also in preventing infections in high-risk populations once someone in the household or in the senior house or in other, let\u2019s say, business -- in other, let\u2019s say, settings that people are living together, one is getting infected. But this is something that will come on top of any discussions that we are having right now if it is positive. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: Hi, great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I\u2019ll stick with the same theme around Paxlovid and business development. First, on Paxlovid, just to make sure we\u2019re all starting on the same page, I guess, can you comment on exactly how many doses are included in the guidance that you\u2019re giving right now? You mentioned in the release, the 20 million to the US, I think 2.75 million to UK, but there\u2019s obviously been some other contracts that have been signed. So, I don\u2019t know if you can give us a number or a range just so we have a sense of kind of what\u2019s included right now. And then, on business development, I just thought one thing was sort of interesting when you\u2019re talking about Slide 13. Albert, you mentioned the strength of allocating cash flows while you pursue new BD opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues in 2030. And I\u2019m just curious, that $25 billion is sort of a specific number, I\u2019m wondering -- obviously that\u2019s in your prepared remarks. So, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s well thought out. So I\u2019m just curious what sort of drove that, and obviously that number could be much smaller or probably a lot bigger depending on what you do over the next few years. So, maybe if you can give some -- provide some clarity on why you worded that the way you did. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Why we selected $25 billion to speak about $25 billion, you mean?\nVamil Divan: Yes, saying at least $25 billion in adjusted revenues.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, I got it, I got it. Frank, would you like to take the Paxlovid and the doses?\nFrank D\u2019Amelio: Of course. So, Vamil, on the Paxlovid guidance, you heard Angela mention before. We\u2019re very active right now, 100-plus negotiations with different governments. Don\u2019t want to put any information out there that could, I\u2019ll call it, lead to misleading assumptions and those assumptions being detrimental to those contract negotiations. But now, you mentioned a couple of contracts that have been announced publicly and where the dose information was included. You mentioned the US $20 million and the UK $2.75 million. If you look at everything we\u2019ve announced publicly, give or take, it\u2019s around -- about 30 million treatments. And so that 30 million treatments is clearly included in the guidance that we provided in the $22 billion of revenue.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. And Aamir, why we selected $25 billion?\nAamir Malik: Sure. So, Vamil, a couple of thoughts. One, we obviously -- between the strength of our balance sheet and the cash flows, we have the ability to deploy significant capital. And going beyond our growing dividend, we think that those cash flows deployed into business development are going to give us an attractive return. So that\u2019s one piece of it. The second is, we think that this is frankly a great time for scientific advancement in our industry, as you look across academia, venture, biotech, big, small, there is no shortage of external substrate that we think can complement what we\u2019re doing internally. And we\u2019re going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the science that we want to pursue. And the combination of those two things, combined with the capabilities that we have, we think that there is significant growth that we can add to our business through business development going forward.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. And also -- it is very important also to understand, Vamil, that we believe that once you put a target, you better execute way better when you have a target in front of you. And actually believe that the target is to be public because we\u2019re a public company and we don\u2019t have a problem to do it. So, also we went into to analyze the substrate and the opportunity, and as always, we are providing at least $25 billion, because as always we like to have targets that we\u2019re putting out there and we\u2019re beating them. But we believe that with the current, all our analytics that we have done, this is a very reasonable target to achieve, without, let\u2019s say, utilizing all of our firepower right now. So that will allow to do dividend and other uses of capital and still do volume. And we are confident to put it out there so that people can start measuring against it. Thank you very much. And next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: Thank you. Firstly, just on the oral GLP-1, I wonder if you can confirm the number of pills a day that you\u2019ll be using in Phase 2b study up to that maximum dose 200 mgs twice a day. Was that pill burden for the highest dose? And also, on obesity, you\u2019ve not discussed that today, but do you have the Phase 2a data inhouse? I note too that you said that you\u2019ve made another oral GLP-1 molecule into the clinic. And I\u2019m just interested to know how that asset will differ from the initial danuglipron. And then, lastly, just on the guidance. So if I\u2019m thinking about the $4 billion range on your sales guidance, given you\u2019ve given us a point estimate there or thereabouts for the vaccine and the antiviral, should I assume the majority of the flex remaining relates to the base business? And if so, can you help me understand the key moving parts within that element of the business, which drugs may be a driver of that flex? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Let me take very quickly, in the interest of time, the last one. No, the flex is spread around everything. So you should assume, for example, in the 31 of -- in the 32 that we gave for -- 33, right, on the vaccines, $500 million up, $500 million down, that\u2019s $1 billion. On the Paxlovid, $500 million up, $500 million, that\u2019s another $1 billion. And then, on the business, as always, we gave $1 billion, up and down. So whatever you think is the midpoint, $1 billion up, $1 billion up, which is consistent with what we were doing all these years for that level of business. And Mikael, on the oral?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Danuglipron is a BID drug and pill burden will be relatively low. You also asked for the additional GLP-1 drug we have in clinical development, that\u2019s once a day drug. As we have now, I think, really defined what will be soon optimal tetration for an oral GLP-1 and we were of course pioneering that there isn\u2019t really a date on it. We may actually consider to take the once daily in the same study as danuglipron, given that we have now this unique opportunity to look through what seems to be two great directs. But currently, I believe danuglipron has all what it takes to go forward to a potential pivotal study based on this study that we shared with you. But it\u2019s, of course, a unique situation to have more than one molecule, and it gives us the very best option for going into Phase 3 quite rapidly after concluding that Phase 2b, pending, of course, expected outcome.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And the last question, please.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll keep it to one since we\u2019re at the end. And at the risk of not getting an answer, on OUS pricing for Paxlovid, I understand the underlying aspect is driving sort of your pricing strategy between GDP and volume-based discounts. But in practice, how consistent has the pricing been across geographies? Any color at a high level would be helpful. And as we think about potentially the standard risk data, the prophy data kind of playing out over the course of the year, should we anticipate that pricing will be relatively consistent per course in the second half relative to the first half? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Our pricing for Paxlovid is a tier pricing. So there is a tier for high-income countries, and that is more or less in line with what you have seen published for Merck\u2019s, for example, product, and we have seen published ourselves. Only exception was the U.S., that they got a very special price because of higher orders, but the rest are more or less consistent. And then there is, of course, there is a second tier for middle-income countries. And for the lower-income countries, we are going to provide it at cost. But also for the low-income countries, in addition to our own providing at cost, of course, we have also initiated a process that a very big number of generic companies will start manufacturing for the low-income countries, which will be 53% of the global population. Now if the price will remain consistent, clearly, this is nothing to comment here. We will not, let\u2019s say, commenting on how prices may or may not evolve in the future. Thank you very much. Now some closing comments very quickly. We have generated strong results, of course, for both pace and impact and financial performance, and we look forward to continue that in 2022. I want to speak a little bit about a few changes in people that we are doing. Speaking about that, we continue to attract visionary, purpose-driven leaders, with a track record of delivering breakthrough results for patients. Case in point, last week, we announced that Dr. William Pao will join Pfizer as Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer, effective March 21 of this year. Dr. Pao brings more than 25 years of experience as an oncologist and scientist. He joins us from Roche, where he most recently served as the Head of Pharma Research and Early Development. He oversaw the discovery and early development of a portfolio of new molecular entities to treat diseases related to cancer, neuroscience, ophthalmology, rare diseases and can go on and on and on. Of course, cancer is a very big part of his portfolio. Clearly, I want to mention that Dr. Pao succeeds Rod MacKenzie, a legendary leader in Pfizer, who recently announced his intent to retire after 35 years of Pfizer. I want to thank Rod for his incredible contribution to Pfizer, including the outstanding leadership in helping bring Comirnaty and Paxlovid to the world so quick. Of course, also, I need to touch based on something that everybody has in mind. I want to take a moment to recognize my trusted colleague and friend, Frank D\u2019Amelio, who also has announced his intention to retire from Pfizer after an incredibly impactful decade and at the half with the Company as CFO. Frank is one of the smartest, more respected and most effective leaders I have ever had the good fortune to work with, and the positive impact he has had on Pfizer and on all our stakeholders is immeasurable. Frank isn\u2019t going anywhere yet, just to clarify as he has agreed to stay on board and as we search for his successor and also to serve in a consulting role through the transition. That said, I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him publicly for all he has meant to Pfizer and to me personally. And Frank, on behalf of our 80,000 colleagues around the world, I wish you good health, every happiness as you begin a new chapter when this time comes, because it\u2019s not yet. Wherever life\u2019s journey takes you, I\u2019m sure it will be directionally correct. And that will bring an end to our call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference Call. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. 2021 was a watershed year for Pfizer, a year in which we set all-time highs in all major areas of focus for Pfizer. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion patients with our medicines and vaccines. That's more than one out of every six people on Earth. Never before has Pfizer's patient impact been so wide-reaching. We improved our ranking from fourth to second among large biopharma companies in the PatientView Global Survey. According to Morning Consult, 61% of Americans have a favorable view of Pfizer, which is up 33 points since January of 2020. Just last week, Fortune ranked us fourth on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list, the highest ranking we have ever achieved. 95% of our colleagues said in an internal survey that they are proud to work for Pfizer, which ranks among the best in corporate America. We increased our investments in research and development from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.5 billion in 2021, and we initiated 13 pivotal clinical studies, the highest number ever for Pfizer. Last but not least, we grew revenues by 92% operationally to $81.3 billion and adjusted diluted EPS by 92% operationally to $4.42. Our success in leading the fight against COVID-19 have not only made a positive difference in the world, I believe they have fundamentally changed our company and our culture forever. Colleagues across Pfizer are inspired by what we have achieved and are more determined than ever to be part of the next potentially game-changing breakthrough. To that end, we are applying the lightspeed principles developed for our COVID-19 work to our other therapeutic areas to make sure we continue to move at the speed of science for the benefit of all patients. As a result, we believe we can do even better with each of these metrics in 2022, each one of them. Our full-year 2022 financial guidance, for example, includes for the first time ever a forecasted revenue midpoint that is triple-digit, $100 billion and an adjusted diluted EPS midpoint of $6.45. While Comirnaty is having a significant positive impact on Pfizer's financial performance, it's the tremendous impact that COVID-19 vaccines have had on society that is most important. In the U.S. alone, the COVID-19 vaccination program is estimated to have saved more than 1 million lives and prevented more than 10 million hospitalizations, according to a December 2021 Commonwealth Fund Report. The economic impact is equally astonishing -- astounding. According to a December 2021 Heartland Forward Report, the rapid deployment and wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. created an estimated economic savings of $438 billion in 2021 alone, which amounted to U.S. GDP being 2.3% higher than it otherwise would have been, 2.3 points. I'm proud to say that Pfizer contributed significantly to these benefits given that approximately 6 out of 10 doses administered in the U.S. as of February 6, 2022, were Comirnaty. This is the value of our science, what our culture has enabled and what drives our people. Now I would like to speak to three factors that will help drive our growth going forward. The first is the long-term outlook for COVID-19 and why we believe we are well positioned to continue to lead the battle against this disease. Second, our thoughtful capital allocation strategy and why we believe it can help drive our growth in the second part of the decade. And third, how our commitment to ESG principles is designed to create sustainable growth for Pfizer to deliver meaningful value to patients and society. Let me start with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our scientists continue to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus and believe it is unlikely that it will be fully eradicated in the foreseeable future. They believe this for several reasons. The global distribution of the virus makes it difficult to contain. The virus has shown an ability to mutate often, making it difficult to stay ahead of it. And the data appear to show that natural infections do not lead to the type of durable protection needed to prevent all transmissions and viral mutation. As a result, people can become reinfected by the same or different strains over time. That said, we now have the tools in the form of vaccines and treatments that we believe will help enable us to not only better manage the pandemic, but also help countries move into an endemic phase. In other words, we believe these tools will help allow us to go back to normality and spend time with family and friends, travel, attend indoor dining and concerts, and enjoy many other activities while lowering the risk of overburdening hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. All of us at Pfizer are extremely proud of the role we have continued to play in bringing these tools to the world. Throughout 2021, we continued our efforts to bring our COVID-19 vaccine to more populations and to further ramp up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. As a result, the market share of our Comirnaty vaccine has continued to grow, representing 70% of all doses distributed across the U.S. and EU as of February 5. When it comes to Paxlovid, we expect to produce 6 million treatment courses during the first quarter of '22. Overall, we expect to produce 30 million courses in the first half of 2022 and 120 million courses for the full year, of course, depending on the global need. Having recently received a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency, Paxlovid has now received emergency or conditional authorization for use with certain populations in approximately 40 countries so far. We are in discussions with governments around the world and expect that as the number of authorizations increase, so will the number of contracts for this treatment, which could truly be a game changer. At Pfizer, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to continue to invest in R&D to maintain our leadership in providing these tools and other meaningful solutions to the world. That's why we continue to develop and test different versions of our vaccine to potentially address variants of concern as they emerge, and why we are currently working on a new Omicron-based vaccine candidate and on a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It's also why just two months after receiving Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Paxlovid, we are already working on a potential next-generation oral COVID-19 treatment. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to maintain this leadership position because of our significant investments in R&D combined with our ability to move at the speed of science without compromising quality or safety, the strong credibility we have earned with governments, healthcare providers and consumers combined with our extensive global field presence, and our unparalleled capabilities for high-quality manufacturing at scale. Now the second thing I wanted to touch on is how we think about our capital allocation and to repeat once more our strategy. We feel that the entirety of our business continues to demonstrate a robust topline growth trajectory through 2025. Consensus estimates are beginning to slowly recognize this momentum. However, consensus estimates currently show our topline shrinking from 2025 to 2030. I want to repeat that this is inconsistent with our own plans. Our goal is to continue to be a growth company from '25 to 2030, despite the impact of LOEs expected during that period. Our confidence in our ability to achieve that is underpinned by the momentum of our business, the durability of our COVID-19 offerings as which I just described, the underestimated strength of our internal pipeline, and, of course, by our ability to deploy capital into growth-focused business development to access external science. Few words about them. We leverage business development opportunities to advance our business strategies and objectives. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows allow us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top-line expectations. We expect to do this while still maintaining our growing dividend, as well as flexibility for other uses of our cash. The focus of our business development efforts will continue to be on compelling external science in the form of both later-stage assets, as well as earlier medical innovations, that have the potential to be breakthroughs for patients. Our focus will largely be in the therapeutic areas and platforms where we have the scientific skills and acumen to add substantial value and select the most successful targets. In addition, we feel that we have distinctive attributes such as world-class excellence in clinical development and unsurpassed manufacturing and commercial capabilities at scale that makes us a very attractive partner across a variety of deal arrangements. We believe the opportunities to deliver on this approach exist, and I will be personally focusing on this execution. I want to emphasize that despite our significant capital flexibility, we will never lower the scientific and financial standards we apply in our business development. As we pursue these opportunities, we will continue to be highly disciplined in our evaluation and prioritization processes. Since 2019, we have already invested almost $25 billion in business development transactions adding more than $13 billion in consensus, I repeat, in consensus 2030 revenue. I would point out that the $13 billion of consensus currently includes nothing for the Trillium assets, the Biohaven collaboration, or the recently announced mRNA deals, all of which have substantial potential. I see this pace of business development accelerating going forward, and I am confident it will be an important driver in ensuring Pfizer as a growth company in the back-half of this decade. One highly visible example of our approach to business development is the recent investments we are making in mRNA technology and collaborations. mRNA has emerged as a versatile technology, with potential applications across many infectious diseases, cancer, rare genetic disorders and even auto-immune diseases. Although mRNA is not the holy grail, we believe the technology has the potential to have a game-changing impact on global health, which is why we have developed a robust mRNA strategy and are aggressively building our platform. While the pandemic has demonstrated that it's not that easy to deliver mRNA vaccines at scale, Pfizer has emerged as a leader in this space. With decades of experience on our side, we've developed what is arguably the most efficient clinical development and vaccine manufacturing capabilities the world has ever seen. We also have rapidly scaled and built out new capabilities in record time by hiring nearly 2,400 new colleagues in these functions in a nine-month timeframe. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest to capitalize on the leadership we have built in terms of both mRNA R&D and manufacturing. In addition, of course, to these internal investments and improvements, we're also making external investments to build out our capabilities in this space. For example, Pfizer recently has entered into four important business development deals to help advance our mRNA strategy. We are expanding our collaboration with BioNTech to use the existing platform to co-develop an mRNA vaccine candidate for herpes zoster virus to protect against shingles. Our agreement with Beam Therapeutics expands our mRNA efforts to another core therapeutic area for Pfizer, rare disease, with a four-year research collaboration for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. We believe this will give us the potential to use mRNA to treat diseases, not just preventive treatment. Our agreement with Acuitas gives us the ability to collaborate with and license their proprietary lipid nanoparticle technology for up to 10 targets for mRNA vaccines and therapies. We believe this will give us greater independence in this space. And we have signed a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Codex DNA, a leader in the development of automated solutions for on-demand synthesis of genes and mRNA, potentially allowing enzymatic assembly of DNA at the front-end of the mRNA production process. This could possibly reduce the time to produce a new vaccine from three months down to two months. If successful, this would be an important differentiator when developing a vaccine for the flu, for example, as it would allow us to select a strain much closer to the start of any flu season. These deals represent only four pieces of a much bigger strategic puzzle. As we continue executing on our mRNA strategy, you should expect to see more targeted activity in this area. Of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy. This is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals, they are marked as new in this slide. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women's health with [Technical Difficulty] I apologize for the technical issue. I will repeat my script for this last slide. And then, we go forward. So, of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy. This is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals, you can see them with the indication, new. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women's health with Biohaven's groundbreaking oral CGRP receptor antagonist, the only one approved in the U.S. for both acute and preventative treatment of migraine, so that we can potentially bring a valuable new treatment option to patients living with this debilitating neurological disease outside the U.S. And through the proposed acquisition of Arena we plan to leverage Pfizer's leading research and global development capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of etrasimod for patients with immunoinflammatory diseases. Now, I'd like to share some details about Pfizer's enhanced ESG strategy. The strategy is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful and measurable impact over the next decade: product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Each quarter going forward, I will provide examples of how we are embedding ESG into all core areas of our business. This quarter, I will highlight our efforts to improve clinical trial diversity, to improve diversity within our colleague base, and help ensure equitable access to our COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. Last year, Pfizer published an industry-first retrospective analysis of demographic data of U.S. participants in 213 of our interventional clinical trials that initiated enrollment from 2011 through 2020. The analysis demonstrated that overall trial participation of Black or African American individuals was at the U.S. census level, 14.3% versus 13.4%, participation of Hispanic or Latino individuals was below U.S. census, 15.9% versus 18.5%, and female participation was at U.S. census 51.1% versus 50.8%. We published this analysis to be transparent and for it to serve as a baseline as we measure progress in this area. We believe that diversity in trials is a matter of equity and good science and are taking decisive steps designed to improve diversity in our trials. Our goal is to achieve racially and ethnically diverse participation at or above U.S. census or disease prevalence levels as appropriate in all our trials. The second item I want to highlight is the significant progress we are making in diversifying our colleague base, particularly at more senior-level positions. In the last three years, for example, we have increased the percentage of women at the Vice President level and above globally from 32% to 42%. Over the same timeframe, we have increased the percentage of minorities at the Vice President level and above in the U.S. from 19% to 25%. The third item I wanted to highlight is the progress we are making to help ensure our COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment are accessible by everyone everywhere. I am thrilled to say that we remain on track to meet or exceed our goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of our vaccine to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022, having just met our goal of delivering the first 1 billion by the end of 2021. I also want to highlight two data points about our 2 billion-dose commitment. 1 billion of these doses are being provided to the poorest countries completely free of charge, thanks to our agreement with the U.S. government. Pfizer is providing these doses to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price, and the government is then providing them to the poorest countries for free. Also, the 1 billion doses we delivered in 2021 represented 37% of all doses we delivered this last year. In terms of our oral COVID-19 treatment, we have signed a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, which we hope will lead to expanded access pending country regulatory authorization or approval in 95 low- and middle-income countries that account for approximately 53% of the world's population. Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has been reviewing methods for linking executive compensation with ESG performance, which we expect to begin this year. For details regarding the impact of our ESG strategy had on our business in 2021, please keep an eye out for Pfizer's 2021 ESG Report, which will be published online in mid-March. In summary, 2021 was an outstanding year for Pfizer, and we look forward to continuing to apply the lessons learned from COVID to deliver breakthroughs for patients across all our therapeutic areas. We remain focused on being nimble, investing in our R&D organization and exploring dynamic partnerships that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. None of this is possible without the contributions of our amazingly purpose-driven colleagues, who continue to rise to the challenge of addressing the world's most devastating diseases. In 2021, our colleagues exceeded expectations. Therefore, we will once again use a part of the bonus pool that the Board approved for bonus-eligible colleagues and executives to provide a one-time special COVID-19 Circumstances Bonus to our non-bonus eligible colleagues across the board to reward them for their hard work and to help them cover personal, family and living expenses incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Frank will provide financial details on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2022. So Mikael? Frank, I think you were disconnected. Thank you. Angela, do you want to take a little bit of Paxlovid? Thank you. Aamir, maybe some comments on the BD. Thank you, Aamir, and just to add to both points because I'm sure that both will be asked a lot. On the Paxlovid, clearly, the numbers could become way bigger than what we have right now, but this is not something that we have done in the past and we don't plan to do right now to give based on what could be the potential as a guidance. We are giving guidance based on what it is more or less secure. However, signed deals are already agreed, but not signed yet deals, but agreed prices and volumes. So, clearly, if you remember, when we started with the vaccine, in the beginning, we had a guidance of, I think, $15 billion in the first quarter, something like that. Eventually, made $36 billion. Here, we start even stronger in our first projections with Paxlovid. So and that's why we manufacture and we'll move ahead with our plans and already we are at 120 million treatments and we have the ability to go higher if the discussions that we're having materialize. In terms of also the business development, I just want to emphasize that -- because I'm getting a lot this question on the size. We are agnostic to size. Where we are biased, it is deals. But in order to justify the premium, we will have to do significant cost synergies. This is not -- these are -- could be very profitable deals for other, let's say, periods of the history of the Company, not now. Right now, the Company is having a manufacturing machine, but it is performing at its best, an R&D machine, but it's performing at its best, a commercial machine, but keeps being the leader in the industry in terms of their ability to execute and deliver. So, the last thing I want to do, it is to do a deal, but in order to justify the premium to the shareholders of the other company, we will have to shut down manufacturing sites and to consolidate the shared sites and consolidate field forces, so that we can justify, so we can generate the core synergies. This is not the time to disrupt the momentum of the Company. This is a time to bring into this manufacturing machine, the research machine, the commercial machine more substrate in addition to what we produce organically ourselves. And this is why the business development is aiming in these areas. So, let's go to the next one. I wouldn't say that we have logistical issues of supply. But, Angela, would you like to take that, please? So, again, to punctuate and give a little bit of context to what Angela said, the 85% that -- it has already been ordered from the quantity that we are making available to U.S. government. It's a very, very high number. For example, the same number in the first month for vaccines, if you remember well, if you remember from that time, was dramatically lower than that because it takes time for the states to get their act together and it is really variable state by state. So, there are states right now, but once the quantities are made to them available, they are ordering immediately and there are states that take their time until they get their act together for the distribution. In general, way, way, way more efficient than what used to be in the first months of the vaccine, also, what is extremely important, it is that every week, there is constant replenishments, which although we do not have right now, data for scripts, because it's too early, what we do have it is that the quantities that the states are accumulating, they're disappearing and then immediately they are placing orders. So, I would say we have, let's say -- we are pretty happy with the way that the first month, the collaboration with the U.S. government went in terms of allocating doses. And there is dramatically also improvement in the tools, as Angela described. But the bigger improvement will come from the fact that the second month, we will make available way more quantities, and the third month, way more quantities because the issues right now for people trying to find it, it is in few places in the state because you can't expand the network of places that it is variable when you have smaller quantities. That will be very, very different in this month and basically all over the place, I think, in the third month where significant quantities will be delivered. Okay. I think let's go to the next question. Yes. Thank you very much. On the last one, just to make sure, but this is not our assumption. Our assumption is way higher of the $13 billion. What I just gave you, it is what is the consensus of the deals that we have signed so far. But on the FTC review, I would like to ask Doug to provide maybe a review on that, Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Thank you. And Aamir, although I did explain that this is consensus numbers, not our numbers, do you want to make any other comment on the $13 billion of 2030 revenues that consensus forecasts for the deals that we have signed? Thank you. Next question please. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think Mikael can take the question. On the flu vaccines, just to make sure what I clarify, the plan was always to initiate an mRNA for flu and a round of two programs entirely. It's not that we show data that forced us to do SI&A. It was always the plan. We are advancing new forms of mRNA technology in SA. It is one of the most promising next-generation of RNA technologies. But Mikael, any comments on that and on the Omicron-specific -- our confidence for superiority? What about Omicron and how confident we are about the superiority? Thank you, Mikael. Next question please. Thank you very much. On the 6%, what gives us confidence, it is that we are -- we keep meeting the goal. As I said that we set the goal in '19 for a 6% all the way CAGR. And then, we had -- year-to-date, we are at 6% right now. The year particularly it is at 5% for the underlying business. But there is a little bit of volatility, but always we knew that this will be a year that we are losing some of the revenues of CHANTIX compared to previous year, which affects quite significant this deal, which then, as we are launching new products, they are coming up. Maybe I will ask Angela to give a little bit more details on the inputs and how this is progressing and also Mikael on the antibody question. Angela? Mikael? Thank you. Next question please. Yes. So, let me take the two first questions and then Mikael can take the research one. Look, it's not that we are giving conservative guidance. What we do, we have principles that we follow because otherwise you can be lost. And the principles that we are following, it is that we are only giving guidance for contracts that have been signed or they are very close to be signed because we have agreed critical terms predominantly. So, this is what you have heard about Paxlovid. Clearly, this is only a very small fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture and it is a small fraction of things that we are discussing right now around -- with different governments. But we are not taking, for example, an approach that we take all the discussions that we're having with the different governments, we risk-adjust them to see how many things can go part through and then we give a guidance. This is not what we do. We only give, and this is the same with the vaccines, things that have been signed or are really agreed by the time -- in a specific deadline. And I think, Frank said it was last week, I think, this deadline. So, clearly, there is a lot of potential, but it is not that we are putting a little bit of our own conservatism in the numbers. We are following a principle, so that we can always be clear with what we say and why we say. So, that's the -- then what about the study dose and the 12 weeks delay, Mikael? All right. Next question please. Yes. What was your question on flu vaccine? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. So, why don't we go -- Mikael, what about RSV? If you can speak about both. We have both now, adult and maternal. And then the mRNA. And then, Angela, if you speak about Ibrance. Thank you, Mikael. And then, what about, Angela, on the Ibrance? Thanks, Angela. Before we move to the next question, I realize that I didn't answer one of the questions that Steve made, Steve Scala, about if we believe that we need business development to grow in the period '25 to '30. And clearly this is not the belief right now. We think that we have a clear LOE number that we estimate around $17 billion. And we have a pipeline that delivers more than the LOEs. So, only organically, with what we have right now, in our calculations, we are at positive growth trajectory. The $25 billion I just mentioned needs to be on top of everything, the balance between LOEs and different funds like that, everything new but will be invented in the meantime, and of course, the COVID trajectory through 2030. But we don't need right now business development at all to grow. What we need business development is to maintain high level of 6% growth top-line, all the way through 2030, for example. Let's go now to the next question, please. Yes. I will take the first one very quickly so that I can give time to Mikael to speak about the second one. Look, we have to wait to see the result, but I don't think it is all mRNA vaccines are the same, so I don't think we should extrapolate preclinical data for one effort to what will be the clinical, let's say, results of the other effort. We are testing both; one shot, we are testing two shots, and we are testing pretty soon hybrid vaccines, but everything what we have seen so far give us confidence that we will have a very strong reaction and immunogenicity of the an Omicron against Omicron. But, of course, that's based on preclinical. We need to wait see the first clinical data so that this assumption can be validated. With that, Mikael, what about Gilead? And by the way also, Andrew, you said what about your expectations. Our expectations are not based on one shot or two shots or five shots. Our expectation, as I said, it is contracts signed as for last week with Comirnaty. So what we'll sign further on will be in addition to whatever we have given so far. Mikael, on the Gilead? Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Yes. I'll take very quickly the third one and then Frank can take the first two questions. I wouldn't -- I would say, it is a continuation but with a way more accelerated pace. I don't think we are changing what we're saying since 2019. We are going into the science, as Aamir said. We are going into areas that we think we'll make fewer mistakes in selecting the right targets. We will be more successful, so we will be able to meet at least the success rates of the industry. Our aim is to exceed them as we're selecting assets. We prefer to go to areas that we can add value and there are significant areas that we can add value by becoming the preferred partner of several biotechs. And also, we have seen, as Aamir said, that some of the best deals we have done were not the most capital-intensive deals, right? So, there are -- so all of that, we are learning, we are not going to relax the discipline that we're having in selecting, but we are going to intensify a lot our activity in that area because, of course, we think that now is the time science is at a stage that we can find enough targets to be able to add value and create value. So that's on the BD side. Now, Frank, a lot of financial questions for margins, guidance, etc. Thank you, Frank. Next question please. Maybe I can take both in the interest of time. I can confirm that our guidance of 6% was excluding BD. So that was from '19 all the way to '25, 6% CAGR, from the things that we had at the time. As regards the standard risk primary endpoint, I think most of the governments, if not all, they are focusing right now all their purchases and their discussions that they're having on the ability to reduce hospitalization. And by the way, most of the -- I mean, FDA, for example, has already approved vaccinated and unvaccinated, which is included -- that means that includes also people that were in the standard risk population because the high-risk population were all unvaccinated. So, if we go -- the standard risk, I think, will contribute, but I think everybody is moving with the assumption that we give it to all people to prevent hospitalization. That's the main thing that everybody is looking. Now, the in-house contact, this is a very different that can change very much the landscape. There are no discussions around that right now. But if it comes positive, clearly that could be used also in preventing infections in high-risk populations once someone in the household or in the senior house or in other, let's say, business -- in other, let's say, settings that people are living together, one is getting infected. But this is something that will come on top of any discussions that we are having right now if it is positive. Let's go to the next question please. Why we selected $25 billion to speak about $25 billion, you mean? Yes, I got it, I got it. Frank, would you like to take the Paxlovid and the doses? Thank you. And Aamir, why we selected $25 billion? Yes. And also -- it is very important also to understand, Vamil, that we believe that once you put a target, you better execute way better when you have a target in front of you. And actually believe that the target is to be public because we're a public company and we don't have a problem to do it. So, also we went into to analyze the substrate and the opportunity, and as always, we are providing at least $25 billion, because as always we like to have targets that we're putting out there and we're beating them. But we believe that with the current, all our analytics that we have done, this is a very reasonable target to achieve, without, let's say, utilizing all of our firepower right now. So that will allow to do dividend and other uses of capital and still do volume. And we are confident to put it out there so that people can start measuring against it. Thank you very much. And next question? Thank you. Let me take very quickly, in the interest of time, the last one. No, the flex is spread around everything. So you should assume, for example, in the 31 of -- in the 32 that we gave for -- 33, right, on the vaccines, $500 million up, $500 million down, that's $1 billion. On the Paxlovid, $500 million up, $500 million, that's another $1 billion. And then, on the business, as always, we gave $1 billion, up and down. So whatever you think is the midpoint, $1 billion up, $1 billion up, which is consistent with what we were doing all these years for that level of business. And Mikael, on the oral? Thank you, Mikael. And the last question, please. Our pricing for Paxlovid is a tier pricing. So there is a tier for high-income countries, and that is more or less in line with what you have seen published for Merck's, for example, product, and we have seen published ourselves. Only exception was the U.S., that they got a very special price because of higher orders, but the rest are more or less consistent. And then there is, of course, there is a second tier for middle-income countries. And for the lower-income countries, we are going to provide it at cost. But also for the low-income countries, in addition to our own providing at cost, of course, we have also initiated a process that a very big number of generic companies will start manufacturing for the low-income countries, which will be 53% of the global population. Now if the price will remain consistent, clearly, this is nothing to comment here. We will not, let's say, commenting on how prices may or may not evolve in the future. Thank you very much. Now some closing comments very quickly. We have generated strong results, of course, for both pace and impact and financial performance, and we look forward to continue that in 2022. I want to speak a little bit about a few changes in people that we are doing. Speaking about that, we continue to attract visionary, purpose-driven leaders, with a track record of delivering breakthrough results for patients. Case in point, last week, we announced that Dr. William Pao will join Pfizer as Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer, effective March 21 of this year. Dr. Pao brings more than 25 years of experience as an oncologist and scientist. He joins us from Roche, where he most recently served as the Head of Pharma Research and Early Development. He oversaw the discovery and early development of a portfolio of new molecular entities to treat diseases related to cancer, neuroscience, ophthalmology, rare diseases and can go on and on and on. Of course, cancer is a very big part of his portfolio. Clearly, I want to mention that Dr. Pao succeeds Rod MacKenzie, a legendary leader in Pfizer, who recently announced his intent to retire after 35 years of Pfizer. I want to thank Rod for his incredible contribution to Pfizer, including the outstanding leadership in helping bring Comirnaty and Paxlovid to the world so quick. Of course, also, I need to touch based on something that everybody has in mind. I want to take a moment to recognize my trusted colleague and friend, Frank D'Amelio, who also has announced his intention to retire from Pfizer after an incredibly impactful decade and at the half with the Company as CFO. Frank is one of the smartest, more respected and most effective leaders I have ever had the good fortune to work with, and the positive impact he has had on Pfizer and on all our stakeholders is immeasurable. Frank isn't going anywhere yet, just to clarify as he has agreed to stay on board and as we search for his successor and also to serve in a consulting role through the transition. That said, I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him publicly for all he has meant to Pfizer and to me personally. And Frank, on behalf of our 80,000 colleagues around the world, I wish you good health, every happiness as you begin a new chapter when this time comes, because it's not yet. Wherever life's journey takes you, I'm sure it will be directionally correct. And that will bring an end to our call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great rest of your day."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert. I'm delighted to share updates from this quarter as we continue to deliver first-in-class science. Today, I will share updates from our COVID-19 programs and select other assets in our pipeline. Let's start with Paxlovid. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to burden public health, we have advanced the science on our novel oral antiviral therapeutic. Importantly, we see consistent, potent antiviral activity in vitro against all current variants of concern, including both Delta and Omicron. This would be expected from how the compound was designed. On the left, you can see a crystal structure showing how tightly nirmatrelvir binds into the active site of the Omicron variant. History has told us from the HIV protease field that the closer the therapeutic is designed to mimic the substrate, the harder it is for resistance to emerge. That combined with the essential nature of the protease, the short duration of treatment and the co-dosing with ritonavir to drug exposures that are over 5x to 6x the amount of compound needed to kill the virus in an in vitro assay, suggests there is a reduced risk for resistance. External data support our findings. In this slide, the lower values, the stronger potency, illustrated by nirmatrelvir being on the low end of the Y axis on the left having the most potent activity. Nirmatrelvir maintains in vitro potency in the low nanomolar range, as you can see in these graphs that include other authorized or approved therapeutics. On the left is in vitro data from a study done with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Pfizer. Nirmatrelvir demonstrated potent antiviral activity as measured by IC50, a measure of drug efficacy indicating the concentration needed to inhibit infection by half. This is consistent with findings from the Rega Institute at KU Leuven in Belgium, shown on the right. We anticipate a New Drug Application decision by the FDA in the high-risk population in the second half of '22, pivotal readouts of our household contact and standard risk studies in the second quarter and second half of '22, respectively, and a study start in children 6 to 18 years old in the first quarter of '22. In the standard risk study, we are expanding enrollment by 750 non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19, and vaccinated, standard-risk patients may also be eligible, provided their last SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was received at least 12 months prior to screening. This expansion will allow us to further evaluate the secondary endpoint seen in the interim analysis, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization and no deaths in the treated compared to placebo. We also are advancing work on a potential next generation SARS-CoV antiviral with the aim of achieving similar high clinical efficacy and pan-Coronavirus design properties that maintain activity, with a favorable safety profile, and counter potential viral resistance but without the need for ritonavir boosting. A first in human study start is expected in the second half of '22. Now, we also continue to advance vaccine development and have achieved Emergency Use Authorization for use in children as young as age 5. Effectiveness data for three doses of the vaccine for people 12 years and older, and early laboratory data observed with Delta and other variants of concern, including Omicron, suggest that people vaccinated with three doses of Comirnaty may have a higher degree of protection against both symptomatic and severe outcomes compared to two primary doses. Informed by these data, in addition to the immunobridging data, we are evaluating a third 3-microgram dose in our study of children six months through four years of age, with the belief that a third dose may be optimal for this age group. However, as pediatric cases and hospitalizations are at an all-time high, FDA urged us to start a rolling Emergency Use Authorization submission with the two-dose efficacy, immunogenicity and safety data we have accumulated thus far while we continue to collect data, including from third-dose administration. We plan to submit third-dose data once available. In the meantime, FDA has scheduled an Advisory Committee meeting for February 15 to consider the two-dose suggested data collected to-date. If Emergency Use Authorization of two doses is granted and the CDC recommends usage, parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID-19 vaccination series for their children between 6 months and 4 years of age while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose. Turning to the adult population. In the wake of surging Omicron cases, in January we completed a laboratory analysis of the effect of a third dose boost of Comirnaty on live virus neutralization. Encouragingly, there was a more than 25-fold increase in Omicron live virus neutralizing titers observed between day of dose three and one month post-dose three. We observed a moderate 4-month post-dose three antibody decay for wild-type and Omicron variant. Between one month and four months post-dose three, neutralizing titers were 1.6- and 2-fold lower for wild-type and the Omicron variant, respectively. We're now starting to see effects of a third dose boost in maintaining a high level of protection against Omicron in the real world. These data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California show Omicron-related emergency department visits without hospitalization on top, and hospitalizations on the bottom. Three doses of COMIRNATY provided better vaccine effectiveness against Omicron than two doses, and there was high vaccine effectiveness of three doses against Omicron-related hospitalization, similar to Delta-related hospitalization. We did see some waning of effectiveness against emergency department admissions due to Omicron three months or more after a third dose, which suggests the potential need for another boost of the current vaccine or an Omicron-based vaccine. We have started an Omicron-based vaccine candidate trial in adults 18 to 55 years of age. This study will evaluate more than 1,400 participants across three cohorts: Those who have already received two doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one or two doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. Those who have already received three doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one dose of the current vaccine or the Omicron-based vaccine. And those who are vaccine-nai\u0308ve will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. This study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that we hope achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as the current vaccine has with both wild-type and earlier variants, but with potentially longer duration of protection. Now, let's turn to our next generation CDK inhibitors for cancer. Most patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer eventually develop resistance to both endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitors despite their transformative efficacy. Inhibition of CDK2, delivered with a CDK selective active drug or a triple activity CDK 2/4/6 agent, may prevent, delay, or reverse resistance and prolong survival. These are data from a subset in the CDK2/4/6 inhibitor Phase 1 dose escalation and antitumor activity study of heavily pre-treated patients with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer. The most improvement in terms of tumor size reduction was seen in patients treated with monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant. We observed three confirmed partial responses and three patients with stable disease for more than 12 months. One patient has been receiving ongoing treatment for more than 28 months. There has been an acceptable safety profile at the recommended Phase 2 dose, which is 25-milligram twice daily. We plan to conduct a Phase 1 dose expansion and expect to complete it in the fourth quarter of this year. Selective CDK2 inhibition with -- CDK2 only inhibitor may allow dose titration and has the potential to be used in combination with approved CDK inhibitors, such as palbociclib, or other next-generation CDK4 selective inhibitors. There were two confirmed partial responses in the Phase 1 study of our selective CDK2 inhibitor in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor/HER2 negative breast cancer who had received/progressed on prior CDK4/6 inhibition and endocrine therapy. One patient had a maximum tumor shrinkage of 54% following CDK2 inhibitor treatment for approximately 8 months, and the second had 100% shrinkage of all target lesions following treatment for approximately 9 months. We are showing scans of the first patient at baseline and 8 weeks. There was an acceptable safety profile as a monotherapy, and we are currently exploring combinations. We expect the Phase 1/2 study to be completed in the second quarter of '23. Now, let's turn to our six-valent Lyme disease vaccine candidate which we are developing in partnership with Valneva. 13 We have received further positive data from our Phase 2 proof of concept study and expect to start Phase 3 in the third quarter of 2022 with a dosing regimen of zero, 2, and 6 months to prime, followed by routine boosters before the start of a Lyme season. Our Phase 2 study is continuing and includes a pediatric population ages 5 to 17 years. Since Lyme disease is seasonal, our goal is to establish a regimen that results in high antibodies at the beginning of each season. We, therefore, looked at a boost one year after the primary series. We saw substantial boost antibody response in Phase 2 to all six serotypes present in North America and Europe following the three-dose primary series vaccination schedule, with a 14- to 31-fold rise in season one and a 51- to 69-fold rise in season two. The vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated at all dose levels tested, and we are excited about further development and the potential to help prevent this debilitating disease. Last quarter, we told you that we saw robust dystrophin expression out to one year in our Muscular Dystrophy gene therapy Phase 1b study. I will show you encouraging functional motor data in a moment. We recently shared some very sad news that a DMD patient with advanced disease in the non-ambulatory cohort of the Phase 1b trial passed away after presenting with hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock. This patient was 16 years old and the first in the non-ambulatory cohort treated with RAPAMUNE, along with steroids, as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. RAPAMUNE is not used in the Phase 3 ambulatory study. Like most non-ambulatory DMD patients, he had more advanced disease with underlying cardiac dysfunction. There is evidence of an active viral infection and we are investigating how this may have contributed to the outcome. Additional assessment will be required to define next steps needed to restart the Phase 1b study in non-ambulatory patients who are more progressed in the disease. I will now share data from this study. The ambulatory cohort -- sorry, I had one more sentence to say here. 19 patients were enrolled in this study, 16 of whom received the dose selected for our Phase 3 program and three of whom received a previously studied lower dose. At one year post-treatment, there was a 5.6 point improvement in ambulatory function as measured by North Star Ambulatory Assessment compared to an external control, matched for age and baseline function. This is particularly encouraging given that patients at this age and stage of disease typically experience a considerable decline in ambulatory function as illustrated by the external control. On the right, we show time in study, with six participants nearing or more than three years since treatment. The ambulatory cohort in Phase 1b is similar, but slightly older on average, to the population in the Phase 3 CIFFREO trial. Considering the favorable benefit to risk profile in this study and observed in ambulatory patient population and in consultation with the Data Monitoring Committee, we believe the safety profile of our DMD gene therapy is manageable in this patient group. Additional mitigations are being added to our study protocol in consultation with the DMC and other medical experts. Pending regulatory feedback, we anticipate Phase 3 study sites to begin to re-open in the next few months, with the potential to report topline results and, subject to clinical trial success, submit a BLA by the end of 2023. Turning now to Internal Medicine, and ponsegromab, our candidate for cachexia due to cancer. It targets GDF-15, which as seen is frequently elevated in cancer patients, drives reduction of appetite and body weight loss, and is associated with poor outcomes. There may also be potential to treat cachexia associated with other chronic diseases such as heart failure and COPD. We have encouraging Phase 1b data which I will show next. Ponsegromab was evaluated in 10 cancer patients who were undergoing anti-tumor treatment and had more than 5% body weight loss in the last 6 months, or more than 2% body weight loss with a body mass index of less than 20 kilogram per meters squared or diagnosed sarcopenia. Ponsegromab administration was found to suppress circulating GDF-15 levels in cancer cachexia patients below the level observed in healthy subjects. Preliminary data from the Phase 1b trial show ponsegromab treatment resulted in significant body weight gain compared to historical placebo. You can see the nice trend in body weight increase remained even after the dosing was stopped at week 12. The gray dotted line indicates the historical cut-off associated with improved survival. We are co-developing a companion diagnostic with Roche Diagnostics designed to enable precision medicine, and we expect to start a Phase 2 study in cancer cachexia in the fourth quarter of this year. Injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists offer potent lowering of glucose and weight in diabetic and obese patients, with proven cardiovascular benefit, but this drug class is underutilized due to its injectable administration route. Our small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist danuglipron could potentially offer a convenient oral alternative to injectables and is being evaluated for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, obesity and NASH. It has been developed in our Internal Medicine Research Group with a vision to expand the use of this potent, easily administrated GLP-1 drug class to a primary care setting. Here are data from the Phase 2 study in Type 2 Diabetes. We recorded strong dose-dependent reductions in both HbA1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels and body weight, compared to the marginal effects noted with placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment with the 200 milligram twice daily dose, HbA1c decreased by almost 1.6% and body weight decreased by 5.4 kilograms. The safety and tolerability profile is consistent with the GLP-1 class and the most frequent adverse event rates were GI-related. We expect to start a Phase 2b titration optimization study mid-'22 with doses up to 200 milligram twice a day, and complete a Phase 2b study in non-diabetic subjects with obesity in the first quarter of next year. Finally, here are select recent and upcoming milestones from across the pipeline. The solid blue dots represent milestones achieved and the open blue dots represent anticipated milestones. Programs in bold are major anticipated events. Some of the programs on the right have already been designated as lightspeed, meaning they have accelerated development timelines, or are being considered for lightspeed designation. Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank Morrie Birnbaum, our outgoing Chief Scientific Officer of the Internal Medicine Research Unit, for his immense contributions over the last seven years, and welcome Bill Sessa, who joins us from Yale School of Medicine following a decades-long career in academia, including serving as Vice Chair of Pharmacology, Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Vascular Biology & Therapeutics Program at Yale. Bill is an eminent leader in this field, a groundbreaking scientist and a celebrated innovator, and I know he will bring his tremendous vision and insights to our investigation of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions. Now, let me turn it over to Frank. Thank you. Yes, we are accumulating, first of all, from our mod mRNA data trial, data on various regimens and on multivalent constructs. We remain of the view that we aspire to develop a flu vaccine. Currently, the most aggressive timelines are focused on the mod mRNA. Our plans is to develop something that has a differentiation versus the current tetravalent standard of care. I know other companies have spoken about being similar, while at this moment we still see opportunities to possibly differentiate with an mRNA-based or mod mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we are actually filing the IND for the self-amplified. I think, the protocol may have gone up already on ClinicalTrials.gov, but dosing is going to be within the next couple of months or so. And it's entirely based on us aiming to develop that platform, which has particular relevance for combinations vaccine, given that possibly we expect to have much lower mRNA burden and can over time build vaccine combination of several different pathogens. We'll keep you updated on progress with the mod mRNA flu and we certainly see data that suggests that this is a feasible path and we are working to refine our approach to aim for a differentiated vaccine. Yes. The regulatory path is that we expect to have a -- if successful, an Omicron boost would show higher neutralizing antibodies for Omicron versus a similar boost by the Wild Type vaccine and acceptable titers to the other previously available strains to preserve broad protection, but possibly with higher Omicron. I really think we showed. Let the science play out here. We are talking about a number of weeks before we get data. And as alluded to, it has three different arms on top of three doses, Omicron versus Wild Type, that was on top of three previous doses, on top of two previous vaccine doses, one or two Omicron, that will be very interesting data set, and then Omicron on naive. So, I think it's a really interesting trial and we'll extract a lot of data and we'll report whether we can get that superiority. But in any case, I would just want to punctuate that our current vaccine is active of the three doses and raise relevant neutralizing antibodies. And the T-cell responses that we see are likely the one that contribute in real world evidence to provide effective protection of the current vaccine against hospitalization and death. Omicron vaccine is an interesting opportunity that we'll learn more about. But our science is progressing against several dimensions on how to further improve over time mRNA vaccines, although they're all pretty good ones. So, you should expect Pfizer continue to be a leader in this field through multiple approaches, together with BioNTech. Thank you, Angela. On the TL1A, as you remember, the previous earnings call, we showed some really strong data in the range of 34% endoscopic improvement and, with a biomarker, 48% in patients way above expected standard of care. That trial has enrolled very fast. It's fully enrolled. Full trial readout will be Q4. We are obviously considering based on the encouraging data in the previous trial opportunity for interim analysis that pending data could allow us to accelerate development of the program to its potential pivotal study. So, all in, it's moving very well and very fast. On the danuglipron, I'm pleased that you were happy and impressed with our data. And indeed, I would say the glucose lowering through HbA1c and the body weight deductions are probably among the best in such a short treatment period. Tolerability and discontinuation rates improved versus previous study because we extended the dose titration from two weeks. And overall, safety, adverse events, I think, are very much in line with what you see comparable titration approaches with injectables. Given that we see that we can improve tolerability and discontinuations with this medium titration rate, we have the next studies coming up with a further slow dose titration, maybe up to a month or so, and we think that may even bring readouts of efficacy further above this. So, we are very pleased with the profile. And I think the next study will nail down for us dose regimen and will help us to move with a strong profile into a potential pivotal study. Yes. On the RSV, we have enrolled very well maternal and adult, and are basically, I would say, fully enrolled. So, it's entirely to ensure we have the number of events that we were looking for. And we expect both trials to readout, whether it's somewhere between Q1, Q2 or at a later part of Q2, we'll just see and as events accumulate, but it's going very well. So, I feel very optimistic with RSV study to conclude and we're looking forward to that data. MRNA flu, we are right now accumulating ingenuity from several different type of dose regimens. And if we are able to conclude with an optimal dose regimen using the mod mRNA, a potential Phase 2/Phase 3 study could certainly be initiated this year, but of course it's a little bit early to speculate before you have identified the right Phase 2/3 dose regimen. If we would embark on such a study this year, we expect it can conclude very fast, given our experience to run very large trials in this sector and this population of adults. And so, we're talking about possible conclusion then within next year. But it's, I would say, one step at a time. We'll keep you informed. We are encouraged so far. And we'll go from there. Yes. The interest in our product from Trillium was triggered by its unique design. It is what we call receptor fusion blocker protein in contrast to magrolimab that you referred to that's on hold, the Gilead antibody, it binds with a lower affinity to the target. And that was by purpose to allow it particularly to accumulate on high-expressing cancer cells and less accumulate on red blood cells to cause -- not to cause anemia or hemolytic anemia. And indeed, in our studies that have generated proof of concept, we have seen single-agent activity in blood cancers with basically negligible effect on red blood cells. So this is playing well out. We do not know why magrolimab is on clinical hold, but of course this differentiation that we have in our molecule may be one example of why our molecule has been doing so well this far. While we initially focus on lymphoid malignancies of the B-cell type, we think we also may become increasingly interested to go to the myeloid space where magrolimab has been, AML and MDS, particularly if our profile now may be superior and we're waiting readout from such studies also. So, for us, the Trillium deal is delivering on all what we expected and may actually have upside due to its more unique profile. Yes. Danuglipron is a BID drug and pill burden will be relatively low. You also asked for the additional GLP-1 drug we have in clinical development, that's once a day drug. As we have now, I think, really defined what will be soon optimal tetration for an oral GLP-1 and we were of course pioneering that there isn't really a date on it. We may actually consider to take the once daily in the same study as danuglipron, given that we have now this unique opportunity to look through what seems to be two great directs. But currently, I believe danuglipron has all what it takes to go forward to a potential pivotal study based on this study that we shared with you. But it's, of course, a unique situation to have more than one molecule, and it gives us the very best option for going into Phase 3 quite rapidly after concluding that Phase 2b, pending, of course, expected outcome."

            "name": "Frank D'Amelio",
            "content": "Thanks, Mikael. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine once again had a positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert and Mikael have already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement. Revenue increased 106% operationally in the fourth quarter of '21 driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue excluding the COVID-19 vaccine direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid contribution, the fourth quarter was slower than the first nine months of the year, declining by 2% operationally. As we discussed during our third quarter call, there was a 4% negative impact, or approximately $500 million, from fewer selling days in the U.S. and International. Excluding that impact, operational growth would have been 2%, which is still lower than the mid-to-high single-digit growth we had experienced during the rest of the year. This was factored into our forecasts for the year but let me briefly walk you through this. In our Biopharma business, you will remember that the fourth quarter of '21 faced a tough comp from the fourth quarter of 2020 for Prevnar, as pneumococcal vaccinations were strong ahead of COVID-19 vaccine availability. Excluding vaccines from the current and comparable period would add 5 percentage points to the growth. Adjusting for the unusual comparative period differences related to vaccines and selling days, our revenue growth would have been approximately 7%, which is similar to what we've been delivering lately. For the year, operational revenue growth was 92%. Excluding Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid, 2021 operational revenue growth was 6%. This is consistent with our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly and annual growth rates due to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least a 6% CAGR through 2025. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 16 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the fourth quarter increased primarily due to increased product-level spending, including Comirnaty and higher healthcare reform sales-based fees. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter was primarily driven by increased investments in late-stage pipeline projects, including additional spending related to our oral COVID-19 treatment. [Technical Difficulty] Chris? Okay. I'm not sure I left off, but I think what I'll do is start with the '22 financial guidance. So we've again provided total-company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. We will continue to provide insight into our expected revenues for Comirnaty, and, now for the first time, we will also provide some color on our expected revenues for Paxlovid. However, note that we will no longer be providing EPS guidance for the business excluding Comirnaty. Similarly, we won't provide EPS guidance for Paxlovid. Our revenue guidance represents a record for Pfizer, and we expect total company revenue to be in a range of $98 billion to $102 billion, representing an operational growth rate of 24% at the mid-point. Please consider that this revenue range reflects approximately $1.1 billion of anticipated negative impact from changes in foreign currencies and also the impact of the loss of Meridian's sales of approximately $300 million, both of which your models may not take into account. Regarding our COVID-related revenues, we now expect the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion compared to our prior guidance provided on December 17. For Paxlovid, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion. This means that excluding the COVID-related revenues, we expect sales to be $46 billion at the midpoint, representing operational growth of 5%. While this is slightly below the 6% CAGR that we continue to expect between 2020 and 2025, I would remind you that there will be volatility along the way. Let me give you some detail on our cost and expense guidance. For adjusted cost of sales, we are expecting a range of 32.2% to 34.2%. Given that we are now more than 12 months past the launch of Comirnaty, we expect its negative impact on our cost of sales margins to be less than it was in 2021, assuming a similar level of revenues. Further, Paxlovid is expected to have a very positive impact on cost of sales as a percent of revenues in 2022. On adjusted SI&A, we expect $12.5 to $13.5 billion, an increase of $900 million at the midpoint. We expect our adjusted R&D guidance range to be $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion at the midpoint that is about $500 million higher than last year. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the year somewhat higher than 2021 at approximately 16%. These assumptions yield an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.35 to $6.55 or 47% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021, excluding an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. I would like to point out some additional information which may be helpful for your models. You will note that our guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 5.8 billion which represents an increase of approximately 100 million shares over 2021. This accounts for the number of shares that we normally issue for employee compensation annually. The increase of 100 million shares over 2021 decreases our EPS by about $0.10 at the mid-point. I notice that most of your models instead assume a flat share count for 2022 as compared to 2021. From the first quarter of 2022 and going forward, we've made a decision to modify our adjusted financials' treatment of amortization of intangibles. Previously, we only excluded amortization related to large mergers and acquisitions. Now exclude all intangible asset amortization expense, this is anticipated to contribute $0.6 to our 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share, and helps improve comparability with our peers. 2022 guidance once again assumes no share repurchases. You will note that Pfizer did not repurchase shares in either 2020 or 2021. While we continue to have outstanding unused authorization to repurchase another $5.3 billion of stock and can be opportunistic, given the potentially value-enhancing business development opportunities which are available to us, we do not expect to repurchase shares in 2022. Now a word on our 32% stake in the Consumer JV with GSK. As you know, GSK has announced its intention to engage in a demerger transaction for at least 80% of its 68% stake in the JV in summer 2022. We talked about our stake as a non-core asset whose value we will seek to realize over time. While we have determined neither the manner nor timing of how we will do so, there are a number of possible alternatives and we will attempt to monetize this asset in the manner which will create the most value for our shareholders. We receive approximately $600 million in pre-tax income from the JV annually, and this will not change as a result of the demerger transaction, and our guidance assumes that this will continue throughout 2022 with no change to our 32% stake. Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions and context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split. Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 4 billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The $1 billion increase in expected COVID vaccine revenues to approximately $32 billion in 2022 primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-December, which was the cutoff for our prior guidance. While we can't predict what may be needed due to omicron or other variants, I would also caution you that there is less potential upside to this guidance through the year, compared to the situation we faced in 2021 when the vaccine was newly available and few people had received any doses of the vaccine. As you will remember, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses and payment to -- representing 50% gross profit and split. We expect that, the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to the slightly higher than the high twenties as a percentage of revenue that we had in 2021. Unlike the situation for Comirnaty demand for Paxlovid should have upside from these levels, depending on the outcomes of discussions with certain governments and potential purchases for stockpiling against future coronavirus pandemics. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine and Paxlovid contribution from both periods, you'll see that we expect at the 2020 to 2022 revenue range to be $45 billion to $47 billion, representing approximately 5% operational revenue growth at the midpoint. Please remember our guidance excludes the former revenue contribution of approximately $300 million to Meridian, and all '21 quarters have been recast to exclude Meridian is discontinued operations, accounting for its divestiture. Going forward, we will not give earning guidance, excluding the estimated income from our Comirnaty direct sales and alliance revenues and Paxlovid. However, to help you with your forecasting, a couple of minutes ago, I gave you my view on 2022 Comirnaty pre-tax margins. For Paxlovid, I would think about its margins as being typical for a small molecule drug, and unlike Comirnaty, it is expected to not be dilutive to pre-tax margins. To help you further, several years ago before COVID-19 existed, I spoke about our business being on a path back to a 40% plus pre-tax margin and we expect to achieve this level in 2022 for the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Going forward we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide. In summary, an exceptionally strong quarter and year based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. During the year, we raised guidance, and for the year, we met or exceeded our guidance in all key metrics. Our pipeline continues to advance, and we have invested record amounts to support that advance. Last week, Arena's shareholders voted to approve Pfizer's acquisition of the Company. We look forward to a targeted closing of the Arena acquisition as soon as the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, including antitrust approvals. We continue to expect to be active in regards to business development throughout 2022, as we continue to get access to the best external science and bring breakthroughs to patients in 2025 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Sure. So, Chris, on the walk through you did on, I'll call it, the business excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, I would use the midpoint on the revenue. You used, I think, a 40% income before tax margin. Then you got to tax-effect that. I didn't hear you say tax-effect it. So, if you do the math, you do the walk through and then you tax effect it, obviously dividing that by shares outstanding. That will give you, I think, a number that's in the ballpark. On Paxlovid gross margin, let me answer the question this way. One, we don't give margin information by individual product, right? It's something that, for many reasons, we don't do. But the way to think about it is, one, that the income before tax margin on that, the margin profile is similar to our other solid oral dose products. And remember, when you look at the gross margin, there's going to be SI&A investment in Paxlovid this year because we're launching that product. There's additional R&D investment in product that year because we're continuing obviously to evolve that product. All of that obviously is captured in the income before tax margin on that business, which is similar to our other solid oral dose products. It's all factored in our guidance. The one place where you can really see the impact, and hopefully this is helpful, you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue last year, for the full year, 37.7%. If you look at our guidance this year, 32.2% to 34.2%, the midpoint is 33.2%. That's down, at the midpoint, 4.5%, most of which is being driven by the Paxlovid revenue this year. So maybe that's the way to help you in terms of just how to work the numbers. Of course. So, Vamil, on the Paxlovid guidance, you heard Angela mention before. We're very active right now, 100-plus negotiations with different governments. Don't want to put any information out there that could, I'll call it, lead to misleading assumptions and those assumptions being detrimental to those contract negotiations. But now, you mentioned a couple of contracts that have been announced publicly and where the dose information was included. You mentioned the US $20 million and the UK $2.75 million. If you look at everything we've announced publicly, give or take, it's around -- about 30 million treatments. And so that 30 million treatments is clearly included in the guidance that we provided in the $22 billion of revenue."

            "name": "Aamir Malik",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think in terms of the top line, we're going to be incredibly flexible. We have said repeatedly that we are most interested in compounds that have potential to be real breakthroughs, and this can take the form of later-stage clinical development as well as earlier stage medical innovation. We're going to bias to the Tas, oncology, I&I, rare, vaccines, internal medicine and hospital, where we've got the scientific chops to make good choices and add real value. And we're going to be flexible on the deal types. Acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards, but strategic partnerships and alliances are well. And, in fact, some of our best successes have come from some capital-light collaborations. If we see a larger opportunity that's strategic and creates value and meets the criteria that I just described, we've obviously got the balance sheet to utilize to do that. So, we certainly will look at those, but we're going to talk about and focus on the priorities that I described more so than synergy driven deals per se. Yes. The only thing I would add is, we feel very good about the progression of all of the substrate and the deals since 2019 that Albert outlined. We've seen a significant number of approvals in the EUAs in that group, submissions as well as quite a few Phase 3 starts. So we think that that substrate is progressing well and the $13 billion is the consensus number. Our expectations of what's there are materially higher and there are a number of transactions. We spoke to Trillium, Biohaven and even some of the recent things that we've done in mRNA that are not yet factored in the consensus forecast on those transactions. Sure. So, Vamil, a couple of thoughts. One, we obviously -- between the strength of our balance sheet and the cash flows, we have the ability to deploy significant capital. And going beyond our growing dividend, we think that those cash flows deployed into business development are going to give us an attractive return. So that's one piece of it. The second is, we think that this is frankly a great time for scientific advancement in our industry, as you look across academia, venture, biotech, big, small, there is no shortage of external substrate that we think can complement what we're doing internally. And we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the science that we want to pursue. And the combination of those two things, combined with the capabilities that we have, we think that there is significant growth that we can add to our business through business development going forward."

Under -- the deal is, of course, subject to customary closing conditions and typical anti-trust clearance and shareholder approval, which, as you know, we've received. We don't expect a significant break in time from our proposed sense that the deal will close in the first half of this year. We still expect it to close in the first half of this year."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Sure. So, currently, we are in active discussions with over 100 countries and governments around the world. So, I'd say that the discussions are going really well. In terms of where we are with the contracting, as you say, we've included some of the contracts that we already are -- that we have. But, of course, this number changes every day. And contracts are being secured and distribution agreements being secured literally on a day-to-day basis. So, I think that this is a number to watch out for. And we do continue to expect movement. I think that there is a tremendous amount of interest for our product. And certainly, as the clinical program continues to develop and emerge, as you know, we only have the high-risk study right now, we still have the standard risk and the prophylaxis that's coming up, and I think that the full clinical program will also be another point of impetus for contracting and ordering. So, I think it's going just really well and more to come on this front. Sure. So first of all, again, our deliveries and our allocations for the doses have gone extremely well here in the U.S. Just to give you some context, 265,000 doses have been allocated by the U.S. government since the EUA was approved. And of that 265,000, 85% of all the doses have been ordered. So and we see a range of ordering patterns from the states. Some states are ordering 100% of the allocation, others are 80%, 70%, so on and so forth. So, it is really only a handful that haven't really ordered up to their allocation. But I would say, for the most part, the weekly orders are going up and increasing week by week. And there is a very strong placement of orders. So, I would say that the drawdown right, of the doses and the utilization is going really well. And again, it differs by state what the allocations are and how that's going. And then, as Albert said, I don't know that we have logistical -- like, they are not logistical issues. I think, initially, what was difficult was that it was not clear where the doses were being located because every state had a different system for where to actually distribute Paxlovid from. But there are a number of tools now that have gone up online, both at the state level as well as on Pfizer's website. We've taken the state government tool and also loaded it on our website, so that both HCPs and patients can see where Paxlovid is being -- where it's available and where the orders as well as prescription can be placed. So, I think in that regard, that's all been ironed out. I think looking forward into the future, clearly, having a seamless sort of end-to-end, from diagnosis, positive results to then being able to prescribe quickly and having the patient be able to acquire the drug quickly is our goal. And I think, on all of those fronts, we're working with a number of partners both from a testing and a diagnostics perspective, but also from a telemedicine perspective and from a pharmacy perspective, to ensure that we have as fast and as efficient, I can say, a patient journey, right from diagnosis right until treatment. So, all of that is in place. And you'll continue to hear more about that as the launch and as the utilization increases. Thank you, Louise. I think the 6% confidence is really driven by two things. First of all, the launches, right, that will take place between now and 2025, which will continue to drive growth for us. But also importantly, in our in-line portfolio, Louise, every single one of our products still have opportunities to grow. They can grow from a number of different ways, right? There is still under-diagnosed patients. So, from new diagnosis, you can continue to drive a tremendous amount of growth in Eliquis and in Vyndaqel. In many of our products, we still have class growth. Think about the CDK4/6s, think about Xtandi, think about Braf/Mektovi. These are all therapies that are still, I think, underutilized from a class perspective. So, there's growth there. And then finally, for all of them, there is the opportunity to grow in terms of market share, just given just the strong clinical profile and strong lifecycle support that we have for all of our product. So, I think we see tremendous amount of growth still. We just have not tapped out of growth in our core in-line brands. And then, you add on top of that, the launch brands. This is where we're going to get our growth from. Sure. I can confirm that the patient assistance program is indeed the primary reason for the decline in volume that you've seen on Ibrance. Just to give you some perspective, in Q4 of 2021, our PAP prescriptions were up 32% compared to where it was in Q4 of 2020. And all of this is 53% more than what it was pre-COVID. And so, this is really what has cost us a tremendous amount of paid prescriptions. And that's really the primary reason. We also saw, and throughout the year, and this has been something that we've been watching quarter-over-quarter, just some slowdown in a new patient starts. And -- but we've seen this sort of phenomenon across multiple products in our portfolio. So there's a small contribution from that. But the largest contribution by far is truly this phenomenon we're seeing here in terms of PAPs"

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Sylvia.. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's third quarter earnings call. I am joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Frank D\u2019amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical; Angela Hwang, Group President Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. We expect this call to last 90 minutes. Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclosure on Slide 3, which is shown right now, and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on our earnings release and in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under risk factors. Forward-looking statements on the call speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I'm happy to report that Pfizer generated another solid performance in the third quarter recording 130% operational revenue growth compared with third quarter of 2020. When excluding direct sales and alliance revenues provided by our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 7% operational revenue growth compared with the previous year quarter. We also are raising our 2021 total Company guidance for both revenues and adjusted EPS. While we are proud of our financial performance, we're even more proud of these financial results -- of what these financial results represent in terms of the positive impact we are having on human lives around the world. In the first nine months of 2021, our innovative medicines and vaccines reached nearly a billion people. It's fair to say millions of lives have been saved because of this.  Excluding our COVID-19 vaccine, we reached nearly 300 million people during that time. These are humbling numbers for all of us at Pfizer. At the same time, we delivered to our shareholders the 331st consecutive quarterly dividend. We also continue to advance our R&D pipeline. Some key milestones include the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. for children 5 to 11 years of age. The first patient dosed in our large Phase III RENOIR study for our RSV bivalent vaccine candidate and the initiation of Phase II/III studies for both IV and oral protease inhibitor candidates for COVID-19. Let me start with commentary on some of our key growth drivers in the quarter. The biggest of which was Comirnaty, which contributed $13 billion in global revenue during the third quarter. Today, we have produced 2.6 billion doses and shipped 2 billion doses to 152 countries or territories. So far, 75% of our Comirnaty revenues have been generated outside the U.S. and we continue to sign agreements with governments around the world. We also remain on track to produce 3 billion doses this year, of which at least 1 billion will go to middle- and low-income countries. In addition, our weekly market set of COVID-19 vaccines administered continues to increase. In the U.S., our four-week average market share increased from about 56% in April to about 74% as of October 31st. And in the EU, it went from about 70% to about 80% during the same time period. These market increases are primarily the result of our booster being the first to receive emergency use authorization, and our two-dose series being preferred by some countries around the world for use in certain younger populations. We also continue to follow the science to help ensure we stay ahead of the virus. Let me speak to two examples. First, top line results from our Phase III randomized controlled trial demonstrated a booster dose administered to individuals, 16 years of age and older who previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series, restored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose.  Second, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized our COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children 5 through 11 years of age, the first and only vaccine to receive such authorization. For this age group, the vaccine is to be administered in a two-dose regimen of 10 microgram doses given 21 days apart. The 10-microgram dose level was carefully selected based on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data. Last week, we announced that the U.S. government exercised its final purchase option under the existing U.S. supply agreement to purchase 50 million additional doses of Comirnaty. This brings the total number of pediatric doses purchased by the U.S. government to 115 million, which is enough to vaccinate every U.S. child. Overall, the U.S. has now purchased a total of 600 million doses across all age ranges under this supply agreement.  Now, let's take a look at some of the quarter's other key growth drivers. Eliquis has continued to deliver strong performance with global revenues up 19% operationally to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. In the U.S., sales growth for Eliquis was driven mainly by a 16% growth in prescription volume. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax revenues were up 42% operationally to $501 million globally. Our disease education efforts in the U.S. continue to support increases in appropriate diagnosis. While the main driver of growth in Japan has been the successful establishment of several referral networks in select areas resulting in new patient starts. Ibrance continue outside of the U.S., revenues outside of the U.S. were up 9% operationally to $500 million. This growth was driven by accelerating demand as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by COVID-19 show signs of recovery across several international markets.  Global revenues for Ibrance were up only 1% operationally as the international growth was largely offset by a 3% decline in the U.S. The U.S. decline was driven by an increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through our Patient Assistance Program. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Oncology Biosimilars Portfolio, which is now the largest in the industry with six biosimilars approved in the U.S. for patients living with cancer. Global revenues from this portfolio grew 51% operationally during the quarter to $398 million. This growth was primarily driven by continued strong results from our U.S. therapeutic monoclonal antibody launches. In international developed markets, oncology biosimilars contributed 29% operational growth, driven by new launches of ZIRABEV and continued growth of TRAZIMERA.  Of course, with such a broad portfolio of life-changing and life-saving products, it will be uncommon to not have a few challenges. U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, for example, were down 2%, primarily due to a 36% decline in the adult indication of Prevnar 13 due to the ongoing prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19 and the later start of the flu season compared with last year. Other contributing factors were the continued impact of the lower remaining unvaccinated eligible adult population and the June 2019 change to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the change of ACIP, recommendation for the Prevnar 13 adult indication to shared clinical decision-making. Just two weeks ago, ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use to help protect adults against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine.  Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for adults aged 65 and older, and adults aged 19 to 64 with certain risk conditions without the need to be followed by PPC V23 vaccination. This recommendation recognizes for the first time the significance of helping protect more population under age 65 with comorbid and immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of disease against these 20 diseases causing serotypes. This new one-dose regimen option, once endorsed by the CDC director, also will help simplify longstanding adult pneumococcal recommendations. As a reminder, Prevnar 20 is the only vaccine the FDA has approved not only for invasive pneumococcal disease, but also for Pneumonia. In September, I assume many of you saw that the FDA issued a drug safety communication related which completed review of the Xeljanz oral survey on trial. We are in continuing dialogue with the FDA about its assessment and the resulting final context in Xeljanz label. With this important step taken, we hope we are a step closer to having an update regarding the new drug application for abroticinib in atopic dermatitis, and the supplemental NDA for Xeljanz in [Indiscernible] both of which are currently under FDA review. In terms of Xeljanz, it's currently approved indication in the U.S., we believe that Xeljanz prescribing behavior will adjust in the coming months based on the FDA's update, resulting in an initial correction in the short-term.  But based on the trends we have observed and the broad application of Xeljanz across its approved indications, we believe Xeljanz has the potential to return to growth. Again, once the final risk label is issued and physicians have adjusted their prescribing habits accordingly as we go into 2022 and beyond. [Indiscernible] received marketing authorization for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in both doses. It also received a positive of being in adults from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. We are hopeful this momentum will continue. We have applications currently filed for review with regulators around the globe, including in the U.S. and Australia. Overall, we remain confident in the importance of the JAK inhibitor class for appropriate patients with inflammatory diseases, and they are pursuing a variety of options for advancing additional JAK inhibitor assets within our portfolio. For example, Pfizer has granted an exclusive license to Brepocitinib and TYK2 both in Phase IIII development to a new Company, formed in collaboration with a partner that has a proven track record in late-stage inflammation and immunology drug development. The new Company will direct all future development decisions while Pfizer will have a 25% stake and retain certain ex-U.S. commercial rights for Brepocitinib and TYK2. This transaction will enable the allocation of resources to advance development of Brepocitinib and TYK2 while allowing Pfizer to focus on diversifying its pipeline.  And either way, in which we are continuing to bolster our pipeline is through strategic business development agreements. This slide highlights 10 such agreements we have entered into -- in recent years, spanning four different therapeutic areas. To further build on our strength in cancer research, we acquired Array BioPharma. The team in Boulder, Colorado has become a center of excellence for targeted therapies in not only cancer, but other diseases as well. With an expected 1-2 new compounds entering the clinic every year. Leveraging our strength in gene therapy, we entered into a collaboration with Vivet Therapeutics for a potential gene therapy for Wilson Disease, a rare genetic disorder that can cause severe hepatic damage, neurological symptoms, and potentially death.  Our acquisition of Therachon builds on our rare disease team's 30 years commitment to develop innovative medicines that address significant unmet medical needs of people with rare diseases. Regarding our worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with Akcea, we believe our expertise and breadth of experience in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases makes us well suited to accelerate clinical development of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.  We are excited about our collaboration with Valneva to develop and commercialize Valneva's Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today. Of course, our collaboration with BioNTech on the COVID-19 vaccine led to the first mRNA vaccine ever approved, and this relationship was born out of our companies' initial collaboration to develop an improved flu vaccine based on mRNA tech. Building on our strengths in prostate cancer and women's health, we have entered into an agreement with Myovant.  Joined them in development and commercialize Orcovix Relugolix in advanced prostate cancer, and Relugolics combination tablet in women's health in the U.S. and Canada. Our global collaboration with our Arvinas to develop and commercialize RV 471 and investigational oral product estrogen receptor protein degrader built on our metastatic breast cancer franchise, allowing us to potentially go into earlier non-metastatic patients and add to efficacy of [Indiscernible] in a metastatic setting. Trillium CD47, SIRP-Alpha focus technology has the potential to be a foundational in cancer immunotherapy as [Indiscernible] have been. We look forward to that acquisition closing later this year and in the first half of 2022.  With pre approvals, four EUAs and multiple submissions in the readouts, these transactions are already bearing fruit and positioning us to reach even more pace. Before I close, I want to welcome to the call Aamir Malik, who joined us in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Development -- and Chief Business Innovation Officer. Aamir came to us from McKinsey, where during his 25-year career, he has developed growth strategies, guided mergers and acquisitions, and implemented large-scale programs to improve patients' lives and transform performance for life science companies. This includes working closely with Pfizer on several strategic initiatives.  I have known Aamir for more than 50 years, and I'm certain he will be an incredible addition to Pfizer as we look to the next era of innovation. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on driving operational excellence across the organization and pursuing the kinds of first-in-class science that will define the new Pfizer. Given our Third Quarter performance and our current expectations for the near-term, we continue to expect a revenue CAGR of at least 6% on a risk-adjusted basis through the end of 2025 and double-digit growth on the bottom line. I would remind you that these projections do not include any potential impact from Comirnaty, recent or subsequent business development activities, or potential future mRNA programs.  Rather, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve these growth rates because of the strength of our current product portfolio and R&D pipeline. Now, I will turn it over to Mikael to speak more about our R&D efforts, and then Frank will provide financial details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2021, which looks solid. Mikael.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Albert. I appreciate the chance to share updates on Pfizer's robust R&D pipeline. As the measure of the transformation that we've instituted in our R&D organization, we track our average clinical success rates against peers. In every phase and in trend we achieved greater success rates than peer average in 2020, and have continued to sustain those higher rates in '21. Today I will provide updates from our vaccines, rare disease, inflammation immunology portfolios, and on our overall protease inhibitor. In several cases, I will reference publicly available data on other agents so that you can understand our enthusiasm about what we're seeing in our development program.  Of course, head-to-head clinical trials would be necessary to support any comparative claim. Last Friday, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for 5 to 11-year-old and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is meeting today to discuss recommendation. On the left, we show with the comparable immune response observed with 10 microgram dosing in children 5 through 11, compared to 30 microgram dosing in 16 to 25 year. On the right, we show 90.7% vaccine efficacy observed. This too, is comparable to what we have seen in older population. The rate and severity of fever and chills of the first and second doses were less in the younger children than either adolescents or adults.  We believe that vaccinating younger children is one important step in making our way through this pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect initial pivotal data from the studies in 2 to less than 5-years-old this quarter. And in 6 months to less than 2-years old next quarter, with full data readouts to follow. On the right, we show improved handling conditions that have been approved for vials to those 5 to 11-year olds. Of note are the smaller pack sizes and the ability to refrigerate for up to 10 weeks. We plan to submit data to regulators for potential approval of similar handling conditions for vials used to dose the 12 and older population. We are the first manufacturer to report Phase III clinical efficacy data on a third dose boost and, to the best of our knowledge, are the only Company with an ongoing pivotal efficacy boost study.  In a study of participant 16 and older, shown on top, a booster demonstrated a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% compared to the original two-dose schedule during a period in which Delta was the prevalent strain, affirming the protective impact of the early immunological data which led to the EUA. It's projected that the third dose boost vaccine efficacy is even higher compared to the unvaccinated population, potentially above 98%. This assumes that vaccine efficacy for those vaccinated with two-doses versus unvaccinated is above 55% at this time point. We observed consistent efficacy in younger and older adults.  While the majority of cases were in the older age group, as would be expected, we recorded a relative vaccine efficacy of 100% in individuals aged 16 to 30 years. Data from Israel shown at the bottom and published by Professor Mark Lipsitch of Harvard and others in Lancet, showed that the third dose, protected individuals against severe COVID-19 related outcome. We plan to monitor the participants in our clinical study, and at an appropriate time, consider a randomized fourth dose boost the study to document the impact of additional and possibly annual repeat vaccination.  This will be supplemented with real-world evidence data. Countries have started to recognize the favorable risk-benefit profile of our vaccine. In each country shown here, our vaccines recommended were the only one permitted in younger populations, and indicates of [Indiscernible] not restricted for boosting. News over the weekend from another manufacturer suggest that their vaccine may not be available in the near-term for younger population. We are encouraged by these science-driven decisions, which have helped make Comirnaty one of the most used COVID-19 vaccines globally.  Next, gene therapy. In hemophilia A, we have temporarily and voluntarily paused screening and dosing in our Phase III study evaluating Factor VIII gene therapy, which we're developing with Sangamo, in order to implement a protocol amendment following their observance of Factor VIII levels greater than 150% in some trial participants. To date, no patient has experienced a [Indiscernible] event and some patients are being treated with oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of thrombosis. We are committed to resuming dosing as quickly as possible once the protocol amendment, which is intended to provide guidelines for clinical management of elevated Factor VIII levels is implemented.  Separately based on recent interaction with the FDA, Pfizer no longer plans to conduct an interim analysis of Phase III data from our EMA and B gene therapy programs. We anticipate pivotal data readout to be based on full analysis of at least 50 study participants for EMA and 40 participants for the hemophilia B program. This will push out the timing of readout of those trial compared to our previous expectation. For Hem A, we're working to evaluate the impact of both the FDA feedback as well as the protocol amendment on timelines and we'll share an update at the appropriate time.  For hemophilia B, we anticipate a readout in the First Quarter of '23. We continue to collect long-term fall updates in our Phase 1b DMD study, in which 19 ambulatory boys in the U.S. have been treated and plan to represent the 1-year dataset at a scientific meeting. We recently shared information on muscle weakness, [Indiscernible]. In some cases, with [Indiscernible] in three participants in Phase III ambulatory trial with a specific subset of dystrophin truncation notation. They were treated with higher doses of steroids and all improved within a few weeks, were discharged from the hospital and have recovered or are still recovering.  The Data Monitoring Committee have confirmed that immunological assessment performed in the trial support the hypothesis that the immune response against the immunity's [Indiscernible] protein [Indiscernible] This type of reaction is a risk potentially inherent of any gene replacement therapy, and similar severe adverse events report in other programs to support the notion that is since classified. We have proposed the protocol change to exclude patients with [Indiscernible] affecting X-somes 9 through 13 inclusive or a deletion that affect both X-somes 29 and 30. A few sites have resumed new patients\u2019 activities and we anticipate that nearly all ex-U.S. trial sites will have restarted clinical activity by the end of this month.  These mutations are estimated to represent less than 15%, 15 of patients with DMD. We recognized the devastating impact the DMD has on this boy and their families and plan to include patients with some of these excluded mutations in future study. In addition, we continue to work with FDA to address outstanding R&D questions related to the Phase III studies, including technical aspects of our potency assay matrix. We have made considerable progress with development of the [Indiscernible] as per FDA guidance, and are now in an active phase of filing this update. While we cannot speculate as to when site may open, we're working to reach alignment with the FDA as soon as possible.  In addition, we have 12 pre-clinical gene therapy programs and are anticipating approximately 1-2 [Indiscernible] each year. We'll now turn to a high potency PDE4 plus immune modulator, we are exploring in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Topical delivered high potency PDE4 plus inhibition may offer differentiated efficacy and safety profile compared to other mechanism of action whether used orally or topically. PDE4 inhibition could provide both rapid and deep responses versus other agents, with the potential for further improvement at higher doses. Even at a significant lower dose, we observed promising clinical efficacy compared to what we have seen with PDE4 topicals in other trials. We expect to initiate Phase 2b studies in both diseases in 2022, exploring higher doses.  On the left, we show in vitro potency at the low dose versus Roflumilast and Crisaborole. Our assets demonstrated approximately 240-fold greater inhibition of IL-4 and approximately 25-fold great inhibition of IL-13 versus Roflumilast. On the right, we observed the clinical and significant improvement in excema area severity versus comparatives in other studies, with a 45% reduction from baseline at Week 6. Our assets show stronger or similar efficacy at Week 6 as compared to reported data from another study at Week 8 with the recently approved topical JAK 12 inhibitor Ruxolitinib.  There was no stinging observed at application site. On the left, we saw an approximately 80% reduction in IL-23 versus activated skin [Indiscernible] vehicle in an in vitro skin model. This displays a relevant mechanism of action for high potency DD4 plus in psoriasis. On the right, patients we saw significant clinical improvement in psoriasis area and severity versus a comparator in a separate study with a 4.5-point reduction from baseline at Week 6. Let's turn to a TL1A inhibitor, which targets a newly identified member of the TNFs super family being explored for ulcerative colitis. In a Phase 2a study, we saw a promising endoscopic improvement. Based on the benefit risk profile seen, there's a potential for TL1A inhibition to be used earlier in the treatment paradigm. Phase 2b studies inflammatory bowel disease is ongoing with estimated primary completion in the Fourth Quarter of '22.  On the left, our TL1A inhibitor demonstrated greater endoscopic improvement than what Tofacitinib demonstrated in a similar trial with 34% of patients responding at Week 14. We matched the population based on the characteristic of those involved in our TL1A study using propensity score matching. The Week 4 [Indiscernible] Tofacitinib is interpolated based on Week 8 data of the induction study and Month 12 data from the maintenance and open-label studies. On the right, a post-talk analysis found that 48% of patients who had biomarkers achieved endoscopic improvement versus 13% of patients who were biomark negative.  Approximately 70% of patients were positively biomarker and we believe a precision medicine approach utilizing key biomarkers may enhance patient selection and improve patient outcomes. Next, it's an [Indiscernible] base inhibitor, a potential breakthrough therapy for dermatomyositis that we develop in a research collaboration with Mass Gen Brigham. This is a disease with very limited treatment option. In an ongoing Phase II clinical trial, we have observed significant reduction in clinical disease activity in skin compared to placebo. We anticipate the readout of the full Phase II study in the First Quarter of '22. On the left, in this figure, treatment compared -- demonstrated an 83.6 decrease in gene signature scores from baseline at Week 12 compared to 11.8 with placebo.  On the right, treatment also showed significant decrease in clinical disease activity at Week 12 compared to placebo. An important step in addressing the pandemic will be the availability of effective outpatient treatments for people who acquired COVID-19. In a paper published today in science, we share the design and pre-clinical profile of our novel investigational oral protease inhibitor, including its industrial pan-coronavirus antiviral activity, in vivo efficacy, selectivity and pre-clinical safety profile. A robust program to study the breadth of both treatment and prevention in high risk, standard risk, and household contact populations is well underway. Projected pivotal readouts start potentially this quarter and extend through mid '22.  Finally, our recent milestones are a reflection of those high clinical success rates that are shared at the beginning, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in '22. Select milestones expected in the Fourth Quarter include a pivotal data readout for our C. difficile candidates, a proof-of-concept readout for [Indiscernible] for severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction. And a proof of concept readout for [Indiscernible] or diabetes. Milestones expected in the first half of 2022 include Phase III results for our RSV adult and maternal vaccine candidate.  A potential pivotal Phase II results for [Indiscernible] in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. A proof-of-concept readout for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate a phase to be proof-of-concept readout for the potential Lyme disease vaccine on which we are collaborating with Valneva. A proof-of-concept readout for ROBO2 FC or focal segmental [Indiscernible], a proof of concept readout for Danuglipron for obesity, and Phase III results of Talzenna and Xtandi in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, we expect continued active business development to further augment the clinical portfolio. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions. Now, let me turn it over to Frank.\nFrank D\u2019amelio: Thanks, Mikael. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine, once again, had a significant positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert has already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement, revenue increased to a 130% operationally in the Third Quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution from direct sales and Alliance revenues as Albert said earlier, we saw a continuation of solid performance from the businesses again this quarter, delivering 7% operational revenue growth despite a negative 5% impact from price.  Getting us to a robust volume growth of 12% for the business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution. The 12% volume growth is in spite of an approximately 2% negative impact to growth from Chantix recall and distribution pause. This supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly growth rate to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least 6% CAGR through 2025. There was no impact from the number of selling days in the quarter as compared to the year-ago period, like we saw on our First Quarter, where we had more selling days compared to the year-ago period.  I'd remind you that the offset to this imbalance will be seen in the Fourth Quarter results, where we will have fewer selling days as compared to the year-ago quarter. For the full year, this results in essentially the same number of selling days in 21 as 2020. I will come back to this in a little bit when I discuss the updated guidance. The adjusted cost of sales increased shown here, reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 22% percentage points compared to the Third Quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased primarily due to a level of promotional spend, sales force activity, or similar to pre-pandemic levels. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter, was primarily driven by increased investments in COVID-19 related programs, as well as other programs within our pipeline.  The growth rate for reported diluted EPS was 445%, while adjusted diluted EPS grew a 129% [Indiscernible]. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 4% benefit to revenue, as well as a 4% benefit or $0.02 to adjusted diluted EPS. Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance. We have again provided total Company guidance which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. And then we provided some additional sub ledger details on our assumptions on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and the business without the COVID-19 vaccine. Our revenue guidance has increased, and we now expect total Company revenue to be in a range of $81 to $82 billion, increasing by $2.5 billion at the midpoint.  With the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year now expected to be approximately $36 billion, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion compared to our prior guidance. The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total Company revenue at the midpoint has increased to 44% as compared to 42% at our previous ' 21 guidance. I'll come back to that in a minute. We also adjusted our cost and expense guidance, mostly to reflect actual performance to date. Let me give you some more detail here. Adjusted cost of sales to range has decreased to between 39.1% to 39.6%.  On adjusted SI&A, we have tightened the range and now expect $11.6 to $12.1 billion a decrease for a $150 million at the midpoint. In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $10.4 to $10.9 billion, an increase of $400 million at the endpoint to reflect anticipated incremental spending on COVID-19 and other mRNA -based projects. We are keeping our assumption for the effective tax rate for the year flat compared to prior guidance at approximately 16%. This yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.13 to $4.18, or 84% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.  Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. As discussed earlier, the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split. Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 3 billion doses in total by the end of 2021. The $2.5 billion increase in expected COVID revenues to 36 billion primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-July, which was the cut-off for our prior guidance.  This assumes deliveries of approximately 2.3 billion doses in fiscal year 2021 compared to prior guidance of deliveries of 2.1 billion doses and continues to assume that we will produce 3 billion doses during calendar year 2021. This difference of 700 million doses represents doses which will be delivered in fiscal year 2022. To refresh your memory, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses, and a payment to BioNtech representing the 50% gross profit split. We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue.  This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs and spending on the COVID-19 protease inhibitor antiviral programs. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly decreased to 2021 revenue range to$ 45 to $46 billion. So, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint. The decrease in guidance at the midpoint largely reflects the impact from the [Indiscernible] and pause in shipments. Terms of adjusted diluted EPS without the contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, we have increased the range to be between 260 to 265 for the year which represents approximately 12% operational growth at the midpoint.  These growth rates are all consistent on how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation. You may notice that the implied Q4 guidance suggests non-COVID-19 operational revenue to decline by 1%, especially as compared to the revenue growth that we've seen year-to-date of 8%. Let me walk through the drivers of this. The largest driver of the decline, is a difference in number of selling days, compared to the comparable quarter in 2020. You will remember my discussion as extra selling days in Q1 when we had 3 more selling days in the U.S. and 4 more selling days in the international markets.  And I talked then about how Q4 would largely offset that impact, leaving 2021 as a whole with approximately the same number of selling days, 2020. In Q4, we will now have four fewer selling days each in domestic and international, eight less in total as compared to Q4, 2020. This is expected to decrease sales by approximately $600 million, and have a negative impact of the growth rate of 6% for the Company, excluding COVID vaccine sales. We expect the Chantix sales to be zero in Q4 due to recall and pause in shipments, representing another 2% headwind to growth.  And while it is not on normal practice to discuss 2022 outlook during the Q3 conference call, I wanted to make a brief comment related to potential Comirnaty sales next year, and we've noticed some estimates of those sales would be very high. While we have the capacity to produce 4 billion doses in 2022 at this point, we expect to recognize revenues for 1.7 billion doses in 2022, representing COVID vaccine direct sales and Alliance revenues approximately $29 billion. We continue to engage with governments regarding potential future orders for 2022 including doses for which certain governments have the option to order and take deliveries in 2022. And going forward, we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide.  In summary, a strong quarter and first nine months of the year, based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. We have increased our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year, mainly driven by increased expectations for Comirnaty sales. Our pipeline continues to advance and we have invested to support that advance. We look forward to an expected closing of the Trillium acquisition as soon as this quarter or in the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start to start the Q&A session.\nChris Stevo: Thanks, Frank. Sylvia, we're ready for our first question, please.\nOperator: Your first question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have three today, if I may. Perhaps first, Albert, do you expect vaccine efficacy on hospitalizations to fade overtime? I know this has been a big point of discussion and has direct implications for the longer-term booster usage. Do you expect the hospitalization efficacy to dip below, let\u2019s say, an 80% number? Number two, on the protease inhibitor, I was curious if you guys are expecting different activity in the high-risk versus a low-risk trial? I acknowledge the endpoints are different, but is there any reason to expect viral load reduction to look different between the two? And then finally, on the DMD gene therapy trial, I was curious if you have evaluated anti dystrophin antibodies, perhaps beyond the patients with exon 9-13 or 29, 30. I am just trying to understand if there's a bit of an immune response against the dystrophin being made in other patients as well and whether that will be relevant for the primary endpoint or not. Thank you so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. I think I will give all three questions to Mikael because they are clearly in his domain. Mikael, what do you think about the vaccine efficacy, the protease activity and the DMD?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you very much. Our own studies, the real-world evidence is these coming from Israel all show that you do get waning over time, driven by the immune system, as expected, gradually reducing antibodies in the blood and activate the immune cells, as well as the appearance of more aggressive strain, in this case, the Delta strain. We think that the data show that you first lose protection against symptomatic disease as you have noted in our trials. And then you lose some protection, but more stage loss over severe disease and hospitalization. We were really pleased to share with you today that when you look at the real-world evidence data, we're able, in a very meaningful and substantial way, improve with a third dose boost against all facets of disease, whether symptomatic, whether severe postpartum utilization, and even death.  So yes, there is just a shift in time, and that's why we already now are preparing for revaccination when the third boost immunity may start to fade possibly off the year, which we think would be the type of data to generate to support more of an annual vaccination similar as flu. For the oral protease inhibitor, we think there is an opportunity with our approach where we are able to have high levels of the oral drug to get robust efficacy against high risk and low risk. And that's obviously what we would like to see as the trial reads out and we have to wait for data. I just wanted to emphasize that our standard risk group includes vaccinated breakthrough infection and non-vaccinated with their standard risk. This is the only trial currently running to the best of my knowledge that contains a study population that are vaccinated and we'll get possibly breakthrough infection. It's really unique indication, which is expected to have more and more prominence once the majority of people are vaccinated. And finally, the household study - exposure study, in that one, we expect based on previous experiences from Tamiflu and other antiviral drug that you're likely to get a good probability for even higher, hopefully a very high, antiviral effect. On DMD gene therapy, we're looking at ways to support this patient group that lack a part of the DMD protein, so they are not tolerant to their own protein and hence they generate an immune response to that part when they get the new gene.  I don't think that will happen in any individuals that are born with all components of the dystrophin, but maybe mutated to be not highly functional. So, our focus right now is to executing the majority of patients 85% and then developing supportive protocols, which we think are very feasible also for those that have less tolerance and are more prone direct when they're given the full normal dystrophin transgene.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Mikael. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So maybe just a couple like the one -- I appreciate, Frank, the comments you made around 2022 by in terms of the COVID vaccine sales. Can you maybe just share updated thoughts on how you guys are seeing the revenue stream from these vaccines are playing out over time? A lot of focus beyond \u201823, \u201824, \u201925. And so connected with that, or maybe a broader question about a year ago, you guys hosted that R&D Day and kind of went through the whole pipeline and talked about the $18 billion to $20 billion of revenue that you expect to lose because of that exploration starting in 2026. At that point, you mentioned that the pipeline you felt with the least provision to replace that revenue stream? I'm curious, given everything that\u2019s happened in the past year, kind of what's your updated expectations on your ability to overcome those patent losses in the future? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Frank, do you want to take out this? And then also Angela, you can chime in on the revenue stream.\nFrank D\u2019amelio: Thanks, Albert. Hi, Vamil. So, Vamil, the way I would think about '22 is kind of a rhythm that's similar to '21. And what I mean is, we'll continue to update the numbers for '22, based on the contracts that we've signed and then obviously the deliveries that will be shipped in '22 that go with those contracts. So, think about this year, as we've updated our guidance each quarter, we've been able to increase our revenue guidance to the COVID vaccine because of incremental contracts signed from one quarter to the next. We're using that same approach for 2022. So right now, 1.7 billion, I call that kind of banked, if you will, in terms of the doses and the $29 million that goes with that. Obviously, we've got to ship those doses, but we have contracts in hand that support the 1.7 billion doses and the $29 billion revenue. So that'll be the rhythm of the numbers, the way to think about it going forward in '22. Beyond '22, obviously, we're working our way through those numbers. We continue to believe that the vaccine has durability and that there will continue to be significant revenues beyond '22, but in terms of specifics there, we're continuing to work on that. Albert, I can turn that over to Angela if you'd like.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes please, Angela.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Thank you. And maybe just one more add to that, which is that, as you look into '22 and also the out-years, as Frank said, we will update you as the contracts get confirmed. But many of our contracts already have been confirmed and those are multi-year contracts. So, we already know that looking into '22 and the out years, that there are some that are going to continue to be government-driven. And then maybe the one other thing that will change over the next in the foreseeable future, is just the development of a private market. And most likely, we\u2019ll see that developing in the U.S. sooner than the others, because that's -- ex-U.S. is where the multiyear contracts have already been secured.  But I think that that will be something -- a new dynamic that we are absolutely ready to manage. And we're already transitioning our portfolio. And if you look at the presentations of the vaccine that we have into smaller pack sizes, this instead of stability, different storage enhancements that we're making all with the view of preparing to transition into vaccinations in the community setting, and preparing for a durable business. So, I would just add that to what Frank just mentioned.\nAlbert Bourla: Thanks Angela. And what I will add in this question in addition to what Angela said, I will add that also commercial that's a position of strength for us. I think moving into a private market that's where we know how to make a difference as well. The other thing that I will say it is as you've noticed from the numbers, we are moving ahead to produce 4 billion doses. And we have already secured the contracts for 1.7 billion doses. And there are some more that we have secure in terms of options. And clearly, we have a big number of countries that we're negotiating with us.  But again, I will raise my concern what I had raised in August of last year when most of the negotiation for doses in the next year are coming from high-income countries and some middle-income countries. I think we are producing enough, but for the low- and middle-income countries who received non-for-profit at the lower income countries with very severely discounted price for the middle-income countries they need to place orders. That's including COVAX and to WHO all of them. So, the $4 billion doses that they're going to produce, they are still highly negotiated by the high-end upper middle-class countries and I don't want to reach that level, but again, the low-end middle-income counties would be behind in deliveries because they didn't place their orders amount, so that's one.  As regard the broader question of the 6%, I think nothing has changed, if anything, I think the probabilities are improving in terms of how our pipeline can cover the gap to make sure that we have a 6%. So, when it comes to the 6% for all the years to after '25, we think we feel very, very confident that we will achieve it. And then I remind everyone that this is excluding all this new mRNA that we're working, excluding COVID. So, all of that is -- COVID vaccines -- all of that I think are in a very, very good state. And we are very encouraged with the modern pipeline, the pipeline that comes to fill the gap between '25 and '30.  And this is also where we believe that right now, we can bring it significantly up. What the street projects as a severe decline, I think already with our pipeline, our projections are saying that we will take it to slight growth -- flat to slight growth. And we are very much looking forward to higher programs and we're looking forward to business development to -- because the goal is to sustain a 6% growth from the second part of [Indiscernible] as well, if possible. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. On the oral protease inhibitor, it's closely watched by investors now that Merck has positive results with Molnupiravir but it seems like in your prepared remarks, you spend more time talking about various [Indiscernible] programs in your pipeline versus this one where we'll have readouts sooner. So, I'm wondering if this suggests a lower level of confidence by Pfizer in these upcoming readouts. And then can you just talk about your views of Molnupiravir and also the recent data they released. And also, how do you think drugs like this, whether it's your own PI or Molnupiravir will be used in a real-world setting? Will it primarily be used in the studied populations which is really unvaccinated patients or will it be used more broadly?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. We're very bullish on the oral inhibitor. This is why, earlier this year during summer, I approved another billion-dollar investment at risk to start manufacturing [Indiscernible] and, of course, to start -- to run three studies in parallel; one for the high-risk population, one for the standard population and one for the household, or let's say context population. We -- the studies are ongoing, so there is not much to say right now, other than we feel optimistic. But we need to see the results of the studies and if possible, we'll be ready. And we -- the way that those will be used, I think it is a -- there's significant part in the high-risk population, but because the cost of these medicines is way cheaper than the antibodies, I think the standard population also will have a significant uptake.  And of course, there is a high-volume opportunity in the contact population -- in household contact population, that could really change the paradigm. There will be unvaccinated population but what unfortunately, will have them majority of the infections. And I think these medicines will be predominantly coming to them, but there will be also breakthrough infections either with people of high risk or with other people. But vaccinated people also will be in need of something like that. Actually, Mikael made the comment about that when he spoke about the study that we're running for standard risk of population to our knowledge is the only one that it is around. Just to make sure that there's no misunderstandings here, we are investing very heavily and recount we are cautiously optimistic that the studies will reveal the data, but we will speak when the data are here.  Now, as regards [Indiscernible], I will ask Mikael to make some points, but I would like to say that I don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on other oral inhibitor. I think the fact that Merck's product announced the 50% efficacy. I think that's great news for patients and a great news for the medical community. But hopefully if the product is approved, they will have an option in their hand. Mikael, do have anything to add to that without going to [Indiscernible] Merck's product that they should be the ones to speak about it.\nMikael Dolsten: Absolutely. I think you outlined it very well. We are optimistic, enthusiastic, but as always, we're waiting for the data that we hope to come before year-end for the high-risk. The standard risk as you heard, we are only one running such a study for an oral drug. It's really unique opportunity, and it will be a growing need for those that do not get repeat vaccinations. And I think for the household study, a protease inhibitor, with its well-known safety is really intriguing.  As you know, protease inhibitor of this kind does not possess risk for the type of side effects [Indiscernible] that seen off sometimes with polymerase inhibitor and require longer follow-up before you know about the potential impact. That's why we think the protease inhibitor is really perfect shift for the pandemic moving over gradually, hopefully to an endemic. And we're just waiting eagerly to see it will help. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I have three, if I may. First, regarding your [Indiscernible] biosimilar, you kind of noticed the switch drive has been successful. You've not comment specifically on filing for interchangeability. Can you clarify that point? Second, going across the wires are some comments from DC about negotiating drug prices for 30 drugs by 2028 as part of the negotiated agreement. Is this something that drug industry can live with or not?  Is this something you're objecting to, or is this something that within a great bargain that will settle drug prices for the Drug Price legislation for the next 3 years, is this something the drug industry is comfortable with? And last, regarding your oral GLP-1, [Indiscernible] are you expecting results in diabetes in the Fourth Quarter of this year? Some of your peers suggested that the intraday variation in blood concentration of GLP-1 is bound to lead to higher side effect profile for the efficacy delivered. Can you discuss what is your view here?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much Ronny. I will answer the drug price and Angela, I will pass you the biosimilar question and the rest of the oral GLP-1 to Mikael. So let me start with negotiating the drug price. First of all, I think that we have an issue, I said in multiple times with drug price. But the issue is not the cost to the healthcare system. [Indiscernible] the cost out-of-pocket for the patients for taking their medicines. The cost of drug pricing to the overall healthcare system, it is 12%. So, by definition, it cannot be the big problem. And this cost is going down. In the U.S. in the First Quarter was minus 5, in the Second Quarter it was minus 5, in the Third Quarter is minus 5, in our audited numbers of Pfizer but the -- in fact -- of price. Problem is that none of our patients that are taking our medicines are experienced minus 5 in what they pay.  Actually, they are experiencing increases. And this is because there is a problem with insurance system that forces, tremendous out-of-pocket when it comes to medicines which is not the case when it comes to other, let's say, medical interventions, diagnostics, [Indiscernible] fees, hospitals you name it. Now, what needs to be done is, to have a reform in a way that will affect out of pocket for the patients. And I truly believe that there is a deal to be made right now in Washington. I truly believe that. And I think that the Congress should not miss the opportunity to find a deal right now that will reduce the out of pocket cost of patients which is the main, main issue right now. When it comes to negotiating drug pricing, negotiation is good and are happening right now.  Medicare negotiates very effectively with us. What people, some parts of the political spectrum, wants to see, is not negotiation, it is price fixing. What they're suggesting is negotiation it is that we will be tell the price that if we disagree with this price, then they will tax us 90%, 95% on everything that we sell in the private market. So, this is not negotiation, this is clearly a price fixing. That I think we -- is going to be a very big mistake to see that happening [Indiscernible] we are objecting. But what I want to emphasize here is not if we are disagreeing in negotiating with our pricing, I think it's a great opportunity to have a deal right now in the Congress and -- that will significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the patients when they are taking their meds. Now, with that I'm passing to Angela to speak about the [Indiscernible]\nAngela Hwang: For the biosimilar for [Indiscernible], we will have interchangeability studies and we're finding that in December 2021.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela.\nAngela Hwang: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. The oral GLP-1, I think it's a class with a lot of promise. I think [Indiscernible] is currently the most advanced true oral small molecule. It has not at all the same type of full defects in direction as been seen with oral delivered peptide. As you stated, we will have soon this year a readout with a slower titration for diabetes to optimize efficacy, convenience, and tolerability. This is well known for all introduced GLP-1 peptides.  We'll later next year have an obesity readout and you noted [Indiscernible] an oral has an opportunity to be possibly the most powerful within the oral segment, and are much more convenient form for the injectable, particularly for the new emerging segments of obese patients that need metabolic control. This is very attractive type of treatment to come. And we look forward to generate more data and understand these types of new emerging through oral, how to optimally position it. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. A couple of questions. First on the oral COVID antiviral, the initial data seems to have been delayed from the Third Quarter or the Fourth Quarter of this year to the Fourth Quarter of this year and the First Quarter of next year. So, what is the reason for the delay, for instance, are the events tracking below expectations? And secondly, a follow-up on [Indiscernible]. So, the readout in obesity in the first half of next year is quite intriguing. How quickly thereafter, assuming it's positive, could a Phase III study in obesity alone generate results? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, a very good question. By the way, I don't think that we ever expected the oral in Q3. I'm not sure if something like that was ever said. I think we were always expecting it in the Q4 and still this is a very big chance that this would be the expectation. We'll give a range of Q4 to Q1 of next year, but still this is the expectation that there's very highly chance that we'll have it by the end of the year.  But again, things are improving nicely in all three studies of the oral. But sometimes you need to stop and wait for the data to speak for themselves. So that's our attitudes we are preparing for it. We are manufacturing and we will be ready if hopefully the data are positive. And now about our obesity drug, Mikael, can you take this question?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Just wanted to echo what you said, Albert, we have 305 enrolling well, across all the oral PI and we have used this target date for the quite loss periods. So, we are on track. And all looks well, we'll just wait for the readouts. [Indiscernible] in obesity, we optimize obviously for the titration, as I discussed, because that's important in order to deliver this quite encouraging data that has recently been seen with GLP-1 class injectable. Some reports have shown much above 10% body weight with metabolic gains.  So that's really the purpose to get the right titration, stage titration. And this is a small molecule that we have developed manufacturing processes. So, pending data and dialogues with regulators. I think this is study that could progress quite fast to Phase III as the CMC is not complicated and the drug class is very well-known for regulators, just that this is an oral with an upside.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the oral antiviral for COVID. Just curious how much you think you can manufacture -- how much you can manufacture, what do you think about the durability of these sales? And then is there any first-mover advantage to getting on the market with this? And then my second question is just on CD47, quite a few in development. So how do you plan to differentiate your Trillium assets? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: On the oral, as I said, we keep manufacturing and depends on how much -- we will have already product available this year. And then of course, as we are moving into next year, our manufacturing capacity is ramping up. The durability of this franchise, is more or less analog to the durability of the vaccines franchise, because as long as you had COVID around, you will have a need to vaccinate and protect and then you will have a need to treat and save lives. And I think the durability I expect to be -- given that COVID has been really across the globe and in so many parts of the globe, and I think we're speaking about the years of durability. But of course, that remains to be seen, that's only my assessment. Mikael, can you speak about the CD47?\nMikael Dolsten: Yeah. Now, that's a great question. We think there are several aspects of unique differentiation and that's obviously why we were keen to work on the Trillium product. Number 1. This is ligand trap with an effusion to provide longer half-life. So, it has a lower binding to CD47 than a typical antibody. And it has shown both the in pre-clinical studies and now in clinical studies that you do not get the problematic on target anemia that you see with antibodies. So that's an important unique thing, it matters a lot, particularly for blood cancer patients which already have a fragile bone marrow function, but also for potential solid cancers that are treated with various chemotherapy backbone.  Number 2 is this product is to the best of my knowledge the only one that have showed single agent activity in blood cancers and we have the most advanced dataset coming out in lymphoid malignancies, both related to B-cell malignancies, lymphomas and myelomas. And we see opportunities to combine it with several existing Pfizer assets to give us unique life cycle management. So, several unique aspects, we look forward to posts -- to see potential deal closure, and to work with the staff in Trillium to accelerate these exciting assets.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And Angela, I didn't ask if you have to add anything on the oral in terms of the durability of the revenues other than what I said?\nAngela Hwang: Well, the market that we're looking at, we estimate to be about 150 -- up to 150 million people. When we look at the -- just vaccination rate, infection rates, and then the various risk groups that we talked about today; the high risk, the low risk, as well as those who just maybe in contact with those that are infected, this is the size of population that we're looking at. I think that this opportunity will allow -- is a very attractive one.  And I think that, again, the disease patterns will determine where we go with this, but certainly, it looks to be a durable opportunity as well. And also, not to forget that this is probably something that governments would likely -- would be interested in stockpiling, like the way -- like we saw in the flu. I think that that's an additional commercial opportunity to consider here.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three, if you don't mind. So first one is, can you talk about the 2022 revenue for the for the COVID vaccine and just give us some sense of what is -- what of that is primary series and what of that is boosters and just how you think about that developing over time? Then second on your flu data for your mRNA vaccine.  Can you, I guess comment one, on if you've had any regulatory discussions and if you think you could get approved for just tighter data alone, or you need to run an actual efficacy study, and then secondly, what should we expect to see with that initial readout? And then third, can you just detail what the protocol changes for Hem A and what you think the underlying factors are that are driving those high levels of factor? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. The 2022 revenues are mostly from the countries in --for COVID that Frank spoke. This $29 billion that we have already signed committed contracts of 1.7 billion doses. Those doses, when it comes to high income countries, they are mainly boosters. When it comes to middle income countries and to low-income countries, there is a mix of second doses -- of primary doses, particularly second because you will be given a lot this year [Indiscernible], and also some of them are boosters.  And this is why I said that the low and middle-income countries or even the low-income countries where we do not -- we give it at cost. They need to place orders so that they can secure allocations of our quantities for their boosters. They need to think. Now, I will ask Mikael to speak a little bit about our regulatory discussions on the efficacy, or not, for flu, and then why we're doing the protocol changes. Sorry.\nMikael Dolsten: We're very intrigued by the use of mRNA for flu as it can generate both an antibody response against hemagglutinin and a T-cell response that can be protective, particularly for more severe flu cases. The current flu vaccine, the protein-based are not very potent on T-cell responses, and generate more intermediate level of antibodies. Whether you can register products on those type of immune parameters is something we are, of course, considering and as we generate data, we'll have dialogues with regulators. But, of course, advantageous not just to get the approvals but to have a strong data set on an outcome such as vaccine efficacy. The program will include both outcomes.  As always, you do not need inferiority of antibodies and you may have additional immune parameters that do not exist very much with the traditional flu, but the entire program will, of course, look at vaccine efficacy to also take into account, is broader immune response. But we'll obviously always keep our regulatory dialogues open for opportunities to serve patients as quick as possible. On the protocol change to Hem A we saw that we had some patients that got very high levels of Hem A gene therapy, 150%. We didn't see actual -- we have not recorded any issues in the haemophilia patients with this.  We want to just have an abundance of caution, to have a protocol that would allow active management. And of course, if there are any patient with some risk\u2019s factors, they could easily use oral anti-coagulants, such as Eliquis. I want to just put this into context as we finalize the regulatory submission on this protocol update, that having high Factor VIII level has also some potential longer-term advantage on sustainability of gene therapy. The Factor VIII data that you've seen also from others in the field have shown some more attenuation over time for the Factor VIII molecules. We have reported so far very good efficacy with no need for transfusion and no bleeding.  But to be in the upper range, where we are, on average 60% to 70%, maybe something that allow much longer gene therapy benefit than if you were on the lower end of the spectrum, particularly for Factor VIII patients. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And also, let me add in my previous answer when I said that for the high-income countries is predominantly boosters, of course, there are also, as vaccine rates are getting higher there are primary doses. But also, I forgot to mention the pediatric. And the pediatric, they will be predominantly in next year's revenues. Keep in mind that in Europe, Japan, all the international markets all revenues of COVID that will be realized next month are going to the next financial year and over there will be a lot of pediatrics. Of course, in the U.S. we'll have also some pediatric booked this year. So, with that, the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just two for me. First coming back to the vaccine targets for '22. As we think about the doses beyond the 1.7 billion that you've now contracted for. Is there still sale -- incremental sales opportunity in developed markets for next year or most governments contracted already? I'm just trying to get a sense if we should be thinking about most of those doses, I guess you mentioned in the call a few times, going to emerging markets and low-priced geographies where the vaccines sold closer to cost, or could there actually be some still higher price per dose business to be had? My second question on the vaccine is also just on the margin. Is that high 20% margin that we saw this year a reasonable assumption for next year given the R&D work going on, etc.? And then just a final question was on the COVID PI just talk about that standard risk trial when you're looking at both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. Is that study powered to look at those populations separately, if we were to see different outcomes in that readout as we think about later this year or next year? Thanks so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. I'll start with Angela to answer about the COVID vaccines remain doses next year. Frank, if you can give an answer on the margin, and then Mikael, understands our risk study. Angela.\nAngela Hwang: Thanks for the question Chris. No, we are not all done with the developed markets. Certainly, the contracts are in place and many of them are in place. But also, don't forget that many of these contracts have options attached to them, and those have not been realized. So, I think that there is still opportunity in 2022 for the developed world to acquire additional doses.\nAlbert Bourla: Frank?\nFrank D\u2019amelio: And the increase on the IBT is a percentage of revenue for the COVID vaccines. Remember that IBT as a percentage of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution, applicable royalty expense, and then the gross profit split with BNT so that gets you to I'll call it gross margin. And then we also include in that IBT percentage all of the R&D associated with COVID-related programs for both prevention and treatment and other mRNA-related programs. When you put all of that together, we've guided this year to IBT as percentage of revenues in the high 20s. For next year, you should assume the same thing and then obviously we'll provide updated guidance on all of the P&L line items on our next earnings call when we close out Q4, provide guidance for 2022.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yeah. Thank you for your interest in the standard risk oral PI trials. As I said, no other oral drug, actually the monoclonal antibodies were not used either. So, it's really unique population, which we also recognized as we enrolled the trial, it's enrolling now very well in the trial. And yes, we have secondary endpoints that we'll look at the 2 different groups. And I do think if the vaccine efficacy is what we hope, [Indiscernible] treatment efficacies, what we hope, that should be within our reach to get the claims on both vaccinated breakthrough and all commerce that includes unvaccinated. And as I said, it will be to the best of my knowledge, the only trial on standard risk debt are not vaccinated, but it has this unique opportunity where antibodies are difficult to use in vaccinated, and there is no other way of running it.  This is a growing population and in countries that may be late with revaccinations, of course, this is a really interesting drug profile. Also, for new variant, please remember, I didn't emphasize it that much, our oral PI, to date has shown robust activity against all variants of -- from Delta to Alpha variants, all variants we have tested, we believe it's going to be active against many different coronaviruses. So, Angela spoke about stockpiling. It also has a stockpiling opportunity for new things coming up in the Corona family, even if they're quite remote from SARS-Cov-2. So, it's a real important drug before the world and fingers crossed as we look forward to readout.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges, from FVB, Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. A few quick questions. First, on Prevnar, could you give us a sense of whether you believe Prevnar will return to growth next year and have -- what is the supply that you expect to have in terms of number of doses for next year? Secondly, on the question of overall guidance, it seems to me that next year should be another growth year for Pfizer given what you're saying about the many opportunities for both the COVID vaccine and the antiviral. I know you haven't given guidance, but can you give us a sense of whether that's your expectation as well?  And then lastly on capital, it seems pretty clear that you'll almost be in a net positive cash position by the end of this year given the cash that's coming in for the COVID vaccine, there have been some suggestions that you might redeploy that capital into returning to the consumer business. Is that of any interest or you got to maintain the focus on strictly innovative biopharma? Thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Angela, on Prevnar?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. As we think about the Prevnar adult revenues, I think we have to look at it at the different age ranges. For the 65 plus, the opportunity will be obviously those who are aging in the nearly 65 that are becoming every year, as well as the opportunity and we're actually waiting for the CDC and MMWR to give us guidance as to whether those who have been previously vaccinated with PCV 13 will be candidates for re-vaccination. That's how I think about revenue on the 65 plus. And then in addition to that one, what is completely new is the 18 to 64 efforts. This is a whole new population. It is a large population. And this will be the other opportunity that we'll be looking to for PCV 20 in '22 and beyond.\nAlbert Bourla: Geoff, look on the guidance. First of all, this year we have record -- recorded record sales and I'm very happy that you're predicting that like last year we may grow. We will provide guidance as always in the first month of the year in our fourth call earnings, which I think is late January. As regards the capital allocation, Frank has spoken multiple times about lot of priorities and capital allocation. We are maintaining a growing dividend, that's very clear, and then our second priority is clearly to invest in the business, to invest in developing the business, and actually I will turn to Aamir Malik, which is his first call here to speak a little bit about opportunities in business development and how he sees them.\nAamir Malik: Thanks, Albert. Thanks, Geoffrey. We see business development frankly as a very important part of our strategy and we plan to be very active in deal-making. Specifically, we're going to be interested in compelling later-stage assets that can contribute positively to the top-line growth in the back half of the decade, and we're also going to be interested in accessing medical breakthroughs that are in earlier stages of development.  And we frankly see, focusing in these areas as being much more value-creating than synergy-driven deals that require lots of resource-intensive integrations that can take a long time to complete. Obviously, we don't speak in absolutes and we never say never, but right now our focus will be as I described. On compelling later-stage assets and earlier-stage medical breakthroughs in biopharma.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Aamir and we rightly, as you can understand, we are very active as we speak in a lot of these discussions. So next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A couple of questions. As you look at the competitive environment for oral antivirals for COVID, could you talk how you're thinking about the probability of either your compound or the competitor having a REMS program. I know that [Indiscernible] did at one point, but I think it has REMS now and your protease, shouldn't [Indiscernible] one from a [Indiscernible] point of view. If you care to comment on the competitive outlook for those two drugs from a regulatory side that would be interesting.  And then second, you've spoken previously, Angela, about the Xeljanz rebate providing sufficient ammunition against AbbVie to ensure that Abrocitinib is not disadvantaged when you launch in securing positions on [Indiscernible]. When I look at the totality of the rebate that AbbVie's products generate, it would seem to be a multiple of what Xeljanz does. Doesn't that still mean that you're potentially going to be disadvantaged as you seek to win share in the atopic dermatitis indication? Many thanks.\nAlbert Bourla: Andrew, thank you for all. As always, very good questions. Angela I will give both of them to you.\nAngela Hwang: Andrew, I think on the Abro one as we have learned and we've talked about this in the past as well, we're just in a really different place now. We have a tremendous number of contracts that we have in place, you see that in the gross-to-net when you look at Xeljanz and work with these -- with the various payers. And it's continuing as -- with all new products when you launch, access and getting access is always a critical issue.  And so, we'll continue to do that as we have with all of our products for Abro, not to forget that obviously the profile that we have, the value that we can bring to patients as well as organizations is a big part of what's going to help us to be able to get that access. So, I think that we'll do what we've always done, and that access will build through time. And we believe that we do have a competitive profile that will allow us to play a role in this very, very big market. On your other question, which was related to the protease inhibitor, Andrew would you mind just repeating that again?\nAlbert Bourla: [Indiscernible]\nMikael Dolsten: I'm happy to say a few words. So, you were all --\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, okay. Mikael please.\nMikael Dolsten: -- The different profiles of protease inhibitor and polymerase and how that could play out and the need for REMS. Well, as always, we -- pending positive data, we are extremely experienced in pharmacovigilance programs, and we'll discuss with regulators what they see as the appropriate. For the high-risk group we'll have a five-day study and there could be then options for a polymerase or a protease inhibitor. And it could be an upside to even look at combination between those in the future. For the standard risk, to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that will be completing that study in a relative near-term, and actually the only one running it.  And for the household exposure study, there you are treating potentially healthy uninfected individuals, and as a physician, I would just say that the protease inhibitor class has been and is known to be addressing unique viral product and not really affecting the human cells. So, I would think it would be a very much preferred [Indiscernible] class if the profile comes out as we hope, polymerase inhibitor, nucleoside base, you're always concerned in healthy individuals whether they could incorporate into the genome. Whether the germ line or the mitochondrial genome, so I would think that's something you need to keep in consideration. But that's why we were keen to be working on an oral PI because it is broad utility [Indiscernible] to future variants and future coronaviruses.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And now the last question, please?\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing us in. I guess to start, I just wanted to come back to the 2022 guide. Can you first clarify that that 1.7 billion doses are inclusive of the 700 million that was left over from 2021? And I guess regardless your 4 billion capacity far exceeds the doses you expect to deliver. I appreciate Frank's comment to the projected doses to be distributed will likely -- may and likely will evolve. But is it safe to assume you're done increasing capacity and/or ' 22 could be a peak on capacity?  And then on the TL1A inhibitor, this is the first time I think we're hearing you guys talk about this publicly, presumably which we believe you have a better understanding of what drove the immunogenicity in [Indiscernible] here that you don't view the rate of [Indiscernible] as a problem or that you have confidence it will decrease with the subq formulation. Any insight on this front? And then finally, still plan to hold that Analyst Day this year or has the thinking changed on that front? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Many questions. Angela, explain a little bit the 1.7.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. I think the way to think about it is that the 1.7 billion doses that we talked about for '22, are those that we have line of cycle contracts for. And as Frank said, as contracts continue to be confirmed and finalized, will add to that. The spillover that you mentioned, which is the end of fiscal year but really not the end of calendar year, and so there is some -- there were some doses that were contracted for in 2021, but the revenue will be collected in 2022, so somewhere between December and January. I think the way to think about it is just that we have to look at contracts as well as revenue recognition and those are two -- they're two slightly different things.\nAlbert Bourla: Frank, capacity?\nFrank D\u2019amelio: So, Carter, 3 billion doses this year, 4 billion doses next year. Quite frankly, I think as demand requires, we can continue to expand on our capacity. Just as an example, give you some of the improvements we've made. When we first thought of making the other vaccine, it took us 110 days from [Indiscernible]. We've taken 110 days down to 31 days, so over 70% improvement in terms of the process. And quite frankly, I think we continue to make more improvement, so I don't think capacity is going to be a challenge for us. I think just the matter of our making sure we're meeting the demand that's being generated by patients. And obviously by the contracts we generate and the like. But I don't see capacity as some constraining factor for us.\nAlbert Bourla: Well said Mikael -- Frank. Mikael TL1A?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you for -- Carter -- for asking about TL1A, it's a noble member of the TNFs super family. It's actually had some genetic association with IBD Crohn's disease a more severe Crohn's disease. We're by far the most advanced with our biological. And so far, we have not seen any meaningful impact of [Indiscernible] on activity of the drug in patients. So, we think we will be able to manage that. Of course, we are waiting for the final readout of the study. We think it could be a drug given conveniently subcutaneously. We are reporting based on a biomarker, first to my knowledge, to have a biomarker for selecting of high responders that captured still broader patient group.  And if you look at the efficacy in the biomark group, it's really above where any other agents have reported so far. And that's what we want to report and reproduced in the extended study. And this Tl1A is highly applicable not only to issue colitis, but also to Crohn's, so that's another indication where we will aim to go, which is supported also by genetic study. So, thank you very much for your interest in it and look forward to keep you updated as we generate more data and move on with this exciting program.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And Chris, maybe you answer the question about the analyst I think there was an R&D Day I think in the question, right?\nMikael Dolsten: Sorry about the -- yes.\nChris Stevo: Yes. Sorry. That is our plan, correct.\nAlbert Bourla: All right, so you've heard of that. I think, Chris, that's the end of our call, right?\nChris Stevo: It is.\nAlbert Bourla: Maybe I will make, perhaps, one closing comment. Clearly, we're very happy and very excited for, first of all -- and proud for the impact that we have on global health and public health across the world with 150 countries receiving our vaccines. More than a billion people, we have touched their lives with our medicines and products. I think that's a record not only for us, but for any pharmaceutical Company so far. Also, that came with very strong financial rewards also.  Our $80 plus billion of revenues that we will record this year likely sets a new record from the sales so far of any pharma clearly for Pfizer. We are looking with a lot of optimism in the future because our pipeline is having very exciting projects that are moving very nicely into our utilizing our learning, and our development from COVID-19, so that we can accelerate even further and create new standards not only for us, but for the industry. Thank you very much for your support. And I wish you a nice day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes Pfizer's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I'm happy to report that Pfizer generated another solid performance in the third quarter recording 130% operational revenue growth compared with third quarter of 2020. When excluding direct sales and alliance revenues provided by our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated 7% operational revenue growth compared with the previous year quarter. We also are raising our 2021 total Company guidance for both revenues and adjusted EPS. While we are proud of our financial performance, we're even more proud of these financial results -- of what these financial results represent in terms of the positive impact we are having on human lives around the world. In the first nine months of 2021, our innovative medicines and vaccines reached nearly a billion people. It's fair to say millions of lives have been saved because of this.  Excluding our COVID-19 vaccine, we reached nearly 300 million people during that time. These are humbling numbers for all of us at Pfizer. At the same time, we delivered to our shareholders the 331st consecutive quarterly dividend. We also continue to advance our R&D pipeline. Some key milestones include the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use in the U.S. for children 5 to 11 years of age. The first patient dosed in our large Phase III RENOIR study for our RSV bivalent vaccine candidate and the initiation of Phase II/III studies for both IV and oral protease inhibitor candidates for COVID-19. Let me start with commentary on some of our key growth drivers in the quarter. The biggest of which was Comirnaty, which contributed $13 billion in global revenue during the third quarter. Today, we have produced 2.6 billion doses and shipped 2 billion doses to 152 countries or territories. So far, 75% of our Comirnaty revenues have been generated outside the U.S. and we continue to sign agreements with governments around the world. We also remain on track to produce 3 billion doses this year, of which at least 1 billion will go to middle- and low-income countries. In addition, our weekly market set of COVID-19 vaccines administered continues to increase. In the U.S., our four-week average market share increased from about 56% in April to about 74% as of October 31st. And in the EU, it went from about 70% to about 80% during the same time period. These market increases are primarily the result of our booster being the first to receive emergency use authorization, and our two-dose series being preferred by some countries around the world for use in certain younger populations. We also continue to follow the science to help ensure we stay ahead of the virus. Let me speak to two examples. First, top line results from our Phase III randomized controlled trial demonstrated a booster dose administered to individuals, 16 years of age and older who previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series, restored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose.  Second, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized our COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children 5 through 11 years of age, the first and only vaccine to receive such authorization. For this age group, the vaccine is to be administered in a two-dose regimen of 10 microgram doses given 21 days apart. The 10-microgram dose level was carefully selected based on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data. Last week, we announced that the U.S. government exercised its final purchase option under the existing U.S. supply agreement to purchase 50 million additional doses of Comirnaty. This brings the total number of pediatric doses purchased by the U.S. government to 115 million, which is enough to vaccinate every U.S. child. Overall, the U.S. has now purchased a total of 600 million doses across all age ranges under this supply agreement.  Now, let's take a look at some of the quarter's other key growth drivers. Eliquis has continued to deliver strong performance with global revenues up 19% operationally to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. In the U.S., sales growth for Eliquis was driven mainly by a 16% growth in prescription volume. Vyndaqel and Vyndamax revenues were up 42% operationally to $501 million globally. Our disease education efforts in the U.S. continue to support increases in appropriate diagnosis. While the main driver of growth in Japan has been the successful establishment of several referral networks in select areas resulting in new patient starts. Ibrance continue outside of the U.S., revenues outside of the U.S. were up 9% operationally to $500 million. This growth was driven by accelerating demand as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by COVID-19 show signs of recovery across several international markets.  Global revenues for Ibrance were up only 1% operationally as the international growth was largely offset by a 3% decline in the U.S. The U.S. decline was driven by an increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through our Patient Assistance Program. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Oncology Biosimilars Portfolio, which is now the largest in the industry with six biosimilars approved in the U.S. for patients living with cancer. Global revenues from this portfolio grew 51% operationally during the quarter to $398 million. This growth was primarily driven by continued strong results from our U.S. therapeutic monoclonal antibody launches. In international developed markets, oncology biosimilars contributed 29% operational growth, driven by new launches of ZIRABEV and continued growth of TRAZIMERA.  Of course, with such a broad portfolio of life-changing and life-saving products, it will be uncommon to not have a few challenges. U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, for example, were down 2%, primarily due to a 36% decline in the adult indication of Prevnar 13 due to the ongoing prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19 and the later start of the flu season compared with last year. Other contributing factors were the continued impact of the lower remaining unvaccinated eligible adult population and the June 2019 change to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the change of ACIP, recommendation for the Prevnar 13 adult indication to shared clinical decision-making. Just two weeks ago, ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use to help protect adults against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in the vaccine.  Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for adults aged 65 and older, and adults aged 19 to 64 with certain risk conditions without the need to be followed by PPC V23 vaccination. This recommendation recognizes for the first time the significance of helping protect more population under age 65 with comorbid and immunocompromising conditions who are at increased risk of disease against these 20 diseases causing serotypes. This new one-dose regimen option, once endorsed by the CDC director, also will help simplify longstanding adult pneumococcal recommendations. As a reminder, Prevnar 20 is the only vaccine the FDA has approved not only for invasive pneumococcal disease, but also for Pneumonia. In September, I assume many of you saw that the FDA issued a drug safety communication related which completed review of the Xeljanz oral survey on trial. We are in continuing dialogue with the FDA about its assessment and the resulting final context in Xeljanz label. With this important step taken, we hope we are a step closer to having an update regarding the new drug application for abroticinib in atopic dermatitis, and the supplemental NDA for Xeljanz in [Indiscernible] both of which are currently under FDA review. In terms of Xeljanz, it's currently approved indication in the U.S., we believe that Xeljanz prescribing behavior will adjust in the coming months based on the FDA's update, resulting in an initial correction in the short-term.  But based on the trends we have observed and the broad application of Xeljanz across its approved indications, we believe Xeljanz has the potential to return to growth. Again, once the final risk label is issued and physicians have adjusted their prescribing habits accordingly as we go into 2022 and beyond. [Indiscernible] received marketing authorization for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in both doses. It also received a positive of being in adults from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. We are hopeful this momentum will continue. We have applications currently filed for review with regulators around the globe, including in the U.S. and Australia. Overall, we remain confident in the importance of the JAK inhibitor class for appropriate patients with inflammatory diseases, and they are pursuing a variety of options for advancing additional JAK inhibitor assets within our portfolio. For example, Pfizer has granted an exclusive license to Brepocitinib and TYK2 both in Phase IIII development to a new Company, formed in collaboration with a partner that has a proven track record in late-stage inflammation and immunology drug development. The new Company will direct all future development decisions while Pfizer will have a 25% stake and retain certain ex-U.S. commercial rights for Brepocitinib and TYK2. This transaction will enable the allocation of resources to advance development of Brepocitinib and TYK2 while allowing Pfizer to focus on diversifying its pipeline.  And either way, in which we are continuing to bolster our pipeline is through strategic business development agreements. This slide highlights 10 such agreements we have entered into -- in recent years, spanning four different therapeutic areas. To further build on our strength in cancer research, we acquired Array BioPharma. The team in Boulder, Colorado has become a center of excellence for targeted therapies in not only cancer, but other diseases as well. With an expected 1-2 new compounds entering the clinic every year. Leveraging our strength in gene therapy, we entered into a collaboration with Vivet Therapeutics for a potential gene therapy for Wilson Disease, a rare genetic disorder that can cause severe hepatic damage, neurological symptoms, and potentially death.  Our acquisition of Therachon builds on our rare disease team's 30 years commitment to develop innovative medicines that address significant unmet medical needs of people with rare diseases. Regarding our worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with Akcea, we believe our expertise and breadth of experience in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases makes us well suited to accelerate clinical development of AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.  We are excited about our collaboration with Valneva to develop and commercialize Valneva's Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, the only active Lyme disease vaccine program in clinical development today. Of course, our collaboration with BioNTech on the COVID-19 vaccine led to the first mRNA vaccine ever approved, and this relationship was born out of our companies' initial collaboration to develop an improved flu vaccine based on mRNA tech. Building on our strengths in prostate cancer and women's health, we have entered into an agreement with Myovant.  Joined them in development and commercialize Orcovix Relugolix in advanced prostate cancer, and Relugolics combination tablet in women's health in the U.S. and Canada. Our global collaboration with our Arvinas to develop and commercialize RV 471 and investigational oral product estrogen receptor protein degrader built on our metastatic breast cancer franchise, allowing us to potentially go into earlier non-metastatic patients and add to efficacy of [Indiscernible] in a metastatic setting. Trillium CD47, SIRP-Alpha focus technology has the potential to be a foundational in cancer immunotherapy as [Indiscernible] have been. We look forward to that acquisition closing later this year and in the first half of 2022.  With pre approvals, four EUAs and multiple submissions in the readouts, these transactions are already bearing fruit and positioning us to reach even more pace. Before I close, I want to welcome to the call Aamir Malik, who joined us in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Development -- and Chief Business Innovation Officer. Aamir came to us from McKinsey, where during his 25-year career, he has developed growth strategies, guided mergers and acquisitions, and implemented large-scale programs to improve patients' lives and transform performance for life science companies. This includes working closely with Pfizer on several strategic initiatives.  I have known Aamir for more than 50 years, and I'm certain he will be an incredible addition to Pfizer as we look to the next era of innovation. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on driving operational excellence across the organization and pursuing the kinds of first-in-class science that will define the new Pfizer. Given our Third Quarter performance and our current expectations for the near-term, we continue to expect a revenue CAGR of at least 6% on a risk-adjusted basis through the end of 2025 and double-digit growth on the bottom line. I would remind you that these projections do not include any potential impact from Comirnaty, recent or subsequent business development activities, or potential future mRNA programs.  Rather, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve these growth rates because of the strength of our current product portfolio and R&D pipeline. Now, I will turn it over to Mikael to speak more about our R&D efforts, and then Frank will provide financial details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2021, which looks solid. Mikael. Thank you very much. I think I will give all three questions to Mikael because they are clearly in his domain. Mikael, what do you think about the vaccine efficacy, the protease activity and the DMD? Thank you very much, Mikael. Let's go to the next question. Thank you. Frank, do you want to take out this? And then also Angela, you can chime in on the revenue stream. Yes please, Angela. Thanks Angela. And what I will add in this question in addition to what Angela said, I will add that also commercial that's a position of strength for us. I think moving into a private market that's where we know how to make a difference as well. The other thing that I will say it is as you've noticed from the numbers, we are moving ahead to produce 4 billion doses. And we have already secured the contracts for 1.7 billion doses. And there are some more that we have secure in terms of options. And clearly, we have a big number of countries that we're negotiating with us.  But again, I will raise my concern what I had raised in August of last year when most of the negotiation for doses in the next year are coming from high-income countries and some middle-income countries. I think we are producing enough, but for the low- and middle-income countries who received non-for-profit at the lower income countries with very severely discounted price for the middle-income countries they need to place orders. That's including COVAX and to WHO all of them. So, the $4 billion doses that they're going to produce, they are still highly negotiated by the high-end upper middle-class countries and I don't want to reach that level, but again, the low-end middle-income counties would be behind in deliveries because they didn't place their orders amount, so that's one.  As regard the broader question of the 6%, I think nothing has changed, if anything, I think the probabilities are improving in terms of how our pipeline can cover the gap to make sure that we have a 6%. So, when it comes to the 6% for all the years to after '25, we think we feel very, very confident that we will achieve it. And then I remind everyone that this is excluding all this new mRNA that we're working, excluding COVID. So, all of that is -- COVID vaccines -- all of that I think are in a very, very good state. And we are very encouraged with the modern pipeline, the pipeline that comes to fill the gap between '25 and '30.  And this is also where we believe that right now, we can bring it significantly up. What the street projects as a severe decline, I think already with our pipeline, our projections are saying that we will take it to slight growth -- flat to slight growth. And we are very much looking forward to higher programs and we're looking forward to business development to -- because the goal is to sustain a 6% growth from the second part of [Indiscernible] as well, if possible. Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you very much. We're very bullish on the oral inhibitor. This is why, earlier this year during summer, I approved another billion-dollar investment at risk to start manufacturing [Indiscernible] and, of course, to start -- to run three studies in parallel; one for the high-risk population, one for the standard population and one for the household, or let's say context population. We -- the studies are ongoing, so there is not much to say right now, other than we feel optimistic. But we need to see the results of the studies and if possible, we'll be ready. And we -- the way that those will be used, I think it is a -- there's significant part in the high-risk population, but because the cost of these medicines is way cheaper than the antibodies, I think the standard population also will have a significant uptake.  And of course, there is a high-volume opportunity in the contact population -- in household contact population, that could really change the paradigm. There will be unvaccinated population but what unfortunately, will have them majority of the infections. And I think these medicines will be predominantly coming to them, but there will be also breakthrough infections either with people of high risk or with other people. But vaccinated people also will be in need of something like that. Actually, Mikael made the comment about that when he spoke about the study that we're running for standard risk of population to our knowledge is the only one that it is around. Just to make sure that there's no misunderstandings here, we are investing very heavily and recount we are cautiously optimistic that the studies will reveal the data, but we will speak when the data are here.  Now, as regards [Indiscernible], I will ask Mikael to make some points, but I would like to say that I don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on other oral inhibitor. I think the fact that Merck's product announced the 50% efficacy. I think that's great news for patients and a great news for the medical community. But hopefully if the product is approved, they will have an option in their hand. Mikael, do have anything to add to that without going to [Indiscernible] Merck's product that they should be the ones to speak about it. Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Thank you very much Ronny. I will answer the drug price and Angela, I will pass you the biosimilar question and the rest of the oral GLP-1 to Mikael. So let me start with negotiating the drug price. First of all, I think that we have an issue, I said in multiple times with drug price. But the issue is not the cost to the healthcare system. [Indiscernible] the cost out-of-pocket for the patients for taking their medicines. The cost of drug pricing to the overall healthcare system, it is 12%. So, by definition, it cannot be the big problem. And this cost is going down. In the U.S. in the First Quarter was minus 5, in the Second Quarter it was minus 5, in the Third Quarter is minus 5, in our audited numbers of Pfizer but the -- in fact -- of price. Problem is that none of our patients that are taking our medicines are experienced minus 5 in what they pay.  Actually, they are experiencing increases. And this is because there is a problem with insurance system that forces, tremendous out-of-pocket when it comes to medicines which is not the case when it comes to other, let's say, medical interventions, diagnostics, [Indiscernible] fees, hospitals you name it. Now, what needs to be done is, to have a reform in a way that will affect out of pocket for the patients. And I truly believe that there is a deal to be made right now in Washington. I truly believe that. And I think that the Congress should not miss the opportunity to find a deal right now that will reduce the out of pocket cost of patients which is the main, main issue right now. When it comes to negotiating drug pricing, negotiation is good and are happening right now.  Medicare negotiates very effectively with us. What people, some parts of the political spectrum, wants to see, is not negotiation, it is price fixing. What they're suggesting is negotiation it is that we will be tell the price that if we disagree with this price, then they will tax us 90%, 95% on everything that we sell in the private market. So, this is not negotiation, this is clearly a price fixing. That I think we -- is going to be a very big mistake to see that happening [Indiscernible] we are objecting. But what I want to emphasize here is not if we are disagreeing in negotiating with our pricing, I think it's a great opportunity to have a deal right now in the Congress and -- that will significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the patients when they are taking their meds. Now, with that I'm passing to Angela to speak about the [Indiscernible] Thank you, Angela. Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you, a very good question. By the way, I don't think that we ever expected the oral in Q3. I'm not sure if something like that was ever said. I think we were always expecting it in the Q4 and still this is a very big chance that this would be the expectation. We'll give a range of Q4 to Q1 of next year, but still this is the expectation that there's very highly chance that we'll have it by the end of the year.  But again, things are improving nicely in all three studies of the oral. But sometimes you need to stop and wait for the data to speak for themselves. So that's our attitudes we are preparing for it. We are manufacturing and we will be ready if hopefully the data are positive. And now about our obesity drug, Mikael, can you take this question? Thank you. Next question, please? On the oral, as I said, we keep manufacturing and depends on how much -- we will have already product available this year. And then of course, as we are moving into next year, our manufacturing capacity is ramping up. The durability of this franchise, is more or less analog to the durability of the vaccines franchise, because as long as you had COVID around, you will have a need to vaccinate and protect and then you will have a need to treat and save lives. And I think the durability I expect to be -- given that COVID has been really across the globe and in so many parts of the globe, and I think we're speaking about the years of durability. But of course, that remains to be seen, that's only my assessment. Mikael, can you speak about the CD47? Thank you, Mikael. And Angela, I didn't ask if you have to add anything on the oral in terms of the durability of the revenues other than what I said? Thank you, Angela. Next question, please. Thank you. The 2022 revenues are mostly from the countries in --for COVID that Frank spoke. This $29 billion that we have already signed committed contracts of 1.7 billion doses. Those doses, when it comes to high income countries, they are mainly boosters. When it comes to middle income countries and to low-income countries, there is a mix of second doses -- of primary doses, particularly second because you will be given a lot this year [Indiscernible], and also some of them are boosters.  And this is why I said that the low and middle-income countries or even the low-income countries where we do not -- we give it at cost. They need to place orders so that they can secure allocations of our quantities for their boosters. They need to think. Now, I will ask Mikael to speak a little bit about our regulatory discussions on the efficacy, or not, for flu, and then why we're doing the protocol changes. Sorry. Thank you, Mikael. And also, let me add in my previous answer when I said that for the high-income countries is predominantly boosters, of course, there are also, as vaccine rates are getting higher there are primary doses. But also, I forgot to mention the pediatric. And the pediatric, they will be predominantly in next year's revenues. Keep in mind that in Europe, Japan, all the international markets all revenues of COVID that will be realized next month are going to the next financial year and over there will be a lot of pediatrics. Of course, in the U.S. we'll have also some pediatric booked this year. So, with that, the next question, please. Thank you. I'll start with Angela to answer about the COVID vaccines remain doses next year. Frank, if you can give an answer on the margin, and then Mikael, understands our risk study. Angela. Frank? Mikael? Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Angela, on Prevnar? Geoff, look on the guidance. First of all, this year we have record -- recorded record sales and I'm very happy that you're predicting that like last year we may grow. We will provide guidance as always in the first month of the year in our fourth call earnings, which I think is late January. As regards the capital allocation, Frank has spoken multiple times about lot of priorities and capital allocation. We are maintaining a growing dividend, that's very clear, and then our second priority is clearly to invest in the business, to invest in developing the business, and actually I will turn to Aamir Malik, which is his first call here to speak a little bit about opportunities in business development and how he sees them. Thank you, Aamir and we rightly, as you can understand, we are very active as we speak in a lot of these discussions. So next question, please. Andrew, thank you for all. As always, very good questions. Angela I will give both of them to you. [Indiscernible] Yes, okay. Mikael please. Thank you, Mikael. And now the last question, please? Many questions. Angela, explain a little bit the 1.7. Frank, capacity? Well said Mikael -- Frank. Mikael TL1A? Thank you, Mikael. And Chris, maybe you answer the question about the analyst I think there was an R&D Day I think in the question, right? All right, so you've heard of that. I think, Chris, that's the end of our call, right? Maybe I will make, perhaps, one closing comment. Clearly, we're very happy and very excited for, first of all -- and proud for the impact that we have on global health and public health across the world with 150 countries receiving our vaccines. More than a billion people, we have touched their lives with our medicines and products. I think that's a record not only for us, but for any pharmaceutical Company so far. Also, that came with very strong financial rewards also.  Our $80 plus billion of revenues that we will record this year likely sets a new record from the sales so far of any pharma clearly for Pfizer. We are looking with a lot of optimism in the future because our pipeline is having very exciting projects that are moving very nicely into our utilizing our learning, and our development from COVID-19, so that we can accelerate even further and create new standards not only for us, but for the industry. Thank you very much for your support. And I wish you a nice day."

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert. I appreciate the chance to share updates on Pfizer's robust R&D pipeline. As the measure of the transformation that we've instituted in our R&D organization, we track our average clinical success rates against peers. In every phase and in trend we achieved greater success rates than peer average in 2020, and have continued to sustain those higher rates in '21. Today I will provide updates from our vaccines, rare disease, inflammation immunology portfolios, and on our overall protease inhibitor. In several cases, I will reference publicly available data on other agents so that you can understand our enthusiasm about what we're seeing in our development program.  Of course, head-to-head clinical trials would be necessary to support any comparative claim. Last Friday, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for 5 to 11-year-old and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is meeting today to discuss recommendation. On the left, we show with the comparable immune response observed with 10 microgram dosing in children 5 through 11, compared to 30 microgram dosing in 16 to 25 year. On the right, we show 90.7% vaccine efficacy observed. This too, is comparable to what we have seen in older population. The rate and severity of fever and chills of the first and second doses were less in the younger children than either adolescents or adults.  We believe that vaccinating younger children is one important step in making our way through this pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect initial pivotal data from the studies in 2 to less than 5-years-old this quarter. And in 6 months to less than 2-years old next quarter, with full data readouts to follow. On the right, we show improved handling conditions that have been approved for vials to those 5 to 11-year olds. Of note are the smaller pack sizes and the ability to refrigerate for up to 10 weeks. We plan to submit data to regulators for potential approval of similar handling conditions for vials used to dose the 12 and older population. We are the first manufacturer to report Phase III clinical efficacy data on a third dose boost and, to the best of our knowledge, are the only Company with an ongoing pivotal efficacy boost study.  In a study of participant 16 and older, shown on top, a booster demonstrated a relative vaccine efficacy of 95.6% compared to the original two-dose schedule during a period in which Delta was the prevalent strain, affirming the protective impact of the early immunological data which led to the EUA. It's projected that the third dose boost vaccine efficacy is even higher compared to the unvaccinated population, potentially above 98%. This assumes that vaccine efficacy for those vaccinated with two-doses versus unvaccinated is above 55% at this time point. We observed consistent efficacy in younger and older adults.  While the majority of cases were in the older age group, as would be expected, we recorded a relative vaccine efficacy of 100% in individuals aged 16 to 30 years. Data from Israel shown at the bottom and published by Professor Mark Lipsitch of Harvard and others in Lancet, showed that the third dose, protected individuals against severe COVID-19 related outcome. We plan to monitor the participants in our clinical study, and at an appropriate time, consider a randomized fourth dose boost the study to document the impact of additional and possibly annual repeat vaccination.  This will be supplemented with real-world evidence data. Countries have started to recognize the favorable risk-benefit profile of our vaccine. In each country shown here, our vaccines recommended were the only one permitted in younger populations, and indicates of [Indiscernible] not restricted for boosting. News over the weekend from another manufacturer suggest that their vaccine may not be available in the near-term for younger population. We are encouraged by these science-driven decisions, which have helped make Comirnaty one of the most used COVID-19 vaccines globally.  Next, gene therapy. In hemophilia A, we have temporarily and voluntarily paused screening and dosing in our Phase III study evaluating Factor VIII gene therapy, which we're developing with Sangamo, in order to implement a protocol amendment following their observance of Factor VIII levels greater than 150% in some trial participants. To date, no patient has experienced a [Indiscernible] event and some patients are being treated with oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of thrombosis. We are committed to resuming dosing as quickly as possible once the protocol amendment, which is intended to provide guidelines for clinical management of elevated Factor VIII levels is implemented.  Separately based on recent interaction with the FDA, Pfizer no longer plans to conduct an interim analysis of Phase III data from our EMA and B gene therapy programs. We anticipate pivotal data readout to be based on full analysis of at least 50 study participants for EMA and 40 participants for the hemophilia B program. This will push out the timing of readout of those trial compared to our previous expectation. For Hem A, we're working to evaluate the impact of both the FDA feedback as well as the protocol amendment on timelines and we'll share an update at the appropriate time.  For hemophilia B, we anticipate a readout in the First Quarter of '23. We continue to collect long-term fall updates in our Phase 1b DMD study, in which 19 ambulatory boys in the U.S. have been treated and plan to represent the 1-year dataset at a scientific meeting. We recently shared information on muscle weakness, [Indiscernible]. In some cases, with [Indiscernible] in three participants in Phase III ambulatory trial with a specific subset of dystrophin truncation notation. They were treated with higher doses of steroids and all improved within a few weeks, were discharged from the hospital and have recovered or are still recovering.  The Data Monitoring Committee have confirmed that immunological assessment performed in the trial support the hypothesis that the immune response against the immunity's [Indiscernible] protein [Indiscernible] This type of reaction is a risk potentially inherent of any gene replacement therapy, and similar severe adverse events report in other programs to support the notion that is since classified. We have proposed the protocol change to exclude patients with [Indiscernible] affecting X-somes 9 through 13 inclusive or a deletion that affect both X-somes 29 and 30. A few sites have resumed new patients' activities and we anticipate that nearly all ex-U.S. trial sites will have restarted clinical activity by the end of this month.  These mutations are estimated to represent less than 15%, 15 of patients with DMD. We recognized the devastating impact the DMD has on this boy and their families and plan to include patients with some of these excluded mutations in future study. In addition, we continue to work with FDA to address outstanding R&D questions related to the Phase III studies, including technical aspects of our potency assay matrix. We have made considerable progress with development of the [Indiscernible] as per FDA guidance, and are now in an active phase of filing this update. While we cannot speculate as to when site may open, we're working to reach alignment with the FDA as soon as possible.  In addition, we have 12 pre-clinical gene therapy programs and are anticipating approximately 1-2 [Indiscernible] each year. We'll now turn to a high potency PDE4 plus immune modulator, we are exploring in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Topical delivered high potency PDE4 plus inhibition may offer differentiated efficacy and safety profile compared to other mechanism of action whether used orally or topically. PDE4 inhibition could provide both rapid and deep responses versus other agents, with the potential for further improvement at higher doses. Even at a significant lower dose, we observed promising clinical efficacy compared to what we have seen with PDE4 topicals in other trials. We expect to initiate Phase 2b studies in both diseases in 2022, exploring higher doses.  On the left, we show in vitro potency at the low dose versus Roflumilast and Crisaborole. Our assets demonstrated approximately 240-fold greater inhibition of IL-4 and approximately 25-fold great inhibition of IL-13 versus Roflumilast. On the right, we observed the clinical and significant improvement in excema area severity versus comparatives in other studies, with a 45% reduction from baseline at Week 6. Our assets show stronger or similar efficacy at Week 6 as compared to reported data from another study at Week 8 with the recently approved topical JAK 12 inhibitor Ruxolitinib.  There was no stinging observed at application site. On the left, we saw an approximately 80% reduction in IL-23 versus activated skin [Indiscernible] vehicle in an in vitro skin model. This displays a relevant mechanism of action for high potency DD4 plus in psoriasis. On the right, patients we saw significant clinical improvement in psoriasis area and severity versus a comparator in a separate study with a 4.5-point reduction from baseline at Week 6. Let's turn to a TL1A inhibitor, which targets a newly identified member of the TNFs super family being explored for ulcerative colitis. In a Phase 2a study, we saw a promising endoscopic improvement. Based on the benefit risk profile seen, there's a potential for TL1A inhibition to be used earlier in the treatment paradigm. Phase 2b studies inflammatory bowel disease is ongoing with estimated primary completion in the Fourth Quarter of '22.  On the left, our TL1A inhibitor demonstrated greater endoscopic improvement than what Tofacitinib demonstrated in a similar trial with 34% of patients responding at Week 14. We matched the population based on the characteristic of those involved in our TL1A study using propensity score matching. The Week 4 [Indiscernible] Tofacitinib is interpolated based on Week 8 data of the induction study and Month 12 data from the maintenance and open-label studies. On the right, a post-talk analysis found that 48% of patients who had biomarkers achieved endoscopic improvement versus 13% of patients who were biomark negative.  Approximately 70% of patients were positively biomarker and we believe a precision medicine approach utilizing key biomarkers may enhance patient selection and improve patient outcomes. Next, it's an [Indiscernible] base inhibitor, a potential breakthrough therapy for dermatomyositis that we develop in a research collaboration with Mass Gen Brigham. This is a disease with very limited treatment option. In an ongoing Phase II clinical trial, we have observed significant reduction in clinical disease activity in skin compared to placebo. We anticipate the readout of the full Phase II study in the First Quarter of '22. On the left, in this figure, treatment compared -- demonstrated an 83.6 decrease in gene signature scores from baseline at Week 12 compared to 11.8 with placebo.  On the right, treatment also showed significant decrease in clinical disease activity at Week 12 compared to placebo. An important step in addressing the pandemic will be the availability of effective outpatient treatments for people who acquired COVID-19. In a paper published today in science, we share the design and pre-clinical profile of our novel investigational oral protease inhibitor, including its industrial pan-coronavirus antiviral activity, in vivo efficacy, selectivity and pre-clinical safety profile. A robust program to study the breadth of both treatment and prevention in high risk, standard risk, and household contact populations is well underway. Projected pivotal readouts start potentially this quarter and extend through mid '22.  Finally, our recent milestones are a reflection of those high clinical success rates that are shared at the beginning, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in '22. Select milestones expected in the Fourth Quarter include a pivotal data readout for our C. difficile candidates, a proof-of-concept readout for [Indiscernible] for severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction. And a proof of concept readout for [Indiscernible] or diabetes. Milestones expected in the first half of 2022 include Phase III results for our RSV adult and maternal vaccine candidate.  A potential pivotal Phase II results for [Indiscernible] in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. A proof-of-concept readout for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate a phase to be proof-of-concept readout for the potential Lyme disease vaccine on which we are collaborating with Valneva. A proof-of-concept readout for ROBO2 FC or focal segmental [Indiscernible], a proof of concept readout for Danuglipron for obesity, and Phase III results of Talzenna and Xtandi in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, we expect continued active business development to further augment the clinical portfolio. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions. Now, let me turn it over to Frank. Thank you very much. Our own studies, the real-world evidence is these coming from Israel all show that you do get waning over time, driven by the immune system, as expected, gradually reducing antibodies in the blood and activate the immune cells, as well as the appearance of more aggressive strain, in this case, the Delta strain. We think that the data show that you first lose protection against symptomatic disease as you have noted in our trials. And then you lose some protection, but more stage loss over severe disease and hospitalization. We were really pleased to share with you today that when you look at the real-world evidence data, we're able, in a very meaningful and substantial way, improve with a third dose boost against all facets of disease, whether symptomatic, whether severe postpartum utilization, and even death.  So yes, there is just a shift in time, and that's why we already now are preparing for revaccination when the third boost immunity may start to fade possibly off the year, which we think would be the type of data to generate to support more of an annual vaccination similar as flu. For the oral protease inhibitor, we think there is an opportunity with our approach where we are able to have high levels of the oral drug to get robust efficacy against high risk and low risk. And that's obviously what we would like to see as the trial reads out and we have to wait for data. I just wanted to emphasize that our standard risk group includes vaccinated breakthrough infection and non-vaccinated with their standard risk. This is the only trial currently running to the best of my knowledge that contains a study population that are vaccinated and we'll get possibly breakthrough infection. It's really unique indication, which is expected to have more and more prominence once the majority of people are vaccinated. And finally, the household study - exposure study, in that one, we expect based on previous experiences from Tamiflu and other antiviral drug that you're likely to get a good probability for even higher, hopefully a very high, antiviral effect. On DMD gene therapy, we're looking at ways to support this patient group that lack a part of the DMD protein, so they are not tolerant to their own protein and hence they generate an immune response to that part when they get the new gene.  I don't think that will happen in any individuals that are born with all components of the dystrophin, but maybe mutated to be not highly functional. So, our focus right now is to executing the majority of patients 85% and then developing supportive protocols, which we think are very feasible also for those that have less tolerance and are more prone direct when they're given the full normal dystrophin transgene. Absolutely. I think you outlined it very well. We are optimistic, enthusiastic, but as always, we're waiting for the data that we hope to come before year-end for the high-risk. The standard risk as you heard, we are only one running such a study for an oral drug. It's really unique opportunity, and it will be a growing need for those that do not get repeat vaccinations. And I think for the household study, a protease inhibitor, with its well-known safety is really intriguing.  As you know, protease inhibitor of this kind does not possess risk for the type of side effects [Indiscernible] that seen off sometimes with polymerase inhibitor and require longer follow-up before you know about the potential impact. That's why we think the protease inhibitor is really perfect shift for the pandemic moving over gradually, hopefully to an endemic. And we're just waiting eagerly to see it will help. Thank you. Yes. The oral GLP-1, I think it's a class with a lot of promise. I think [Indiscernible] is currently the most advanced true oral small molecule. It has not at all the same type of full defects in direction as been seen with oral delivered peptide. As you stated, we will have soon this year a readout with a slower titration for diabetes to optimize efficacy, convenience, and tolerability. This is well known for all introduced GLP-1 peptides.  We'll later next year have an obesity readout and you noted [Indiscernible] an oral has an opportunity to be possibly the most powerful within the oral segment, and are much more convenient form for the injectable, particularly for the new emerging segments of obese patients that need metabolic control. This is very attractive type of treatment to come. And we look forward to generate more data and understand these types of new emerging through oral, how to optimally position it. Thank you. Yes. Just wanted to echo what you said, Albert, we have 305 enrolling well, across all the oral PI and we have used this target date for the quite loss periods. So, we are on track. And all looks well, we'll just wait for the readouts. [Indiscernible] in obesity, we optimize obviously for the titration, as I discussed, because that's important in order to deliver this quite encouraging data that has recently been seen with GLP-1 class injectable. Some reports have shown much above 10% body weight with metabolic gains.  So that's really the purpose to get the right titration, stage titration. And this is a small molecule that we have developed manufacturing processes. So, pending data and dialogues with regulators. I think this is study that could progress quite fast to Phase III as the CMC is not complicated and the drug class is very well-known for regulators, just that this is an oral with an upside. Yeah. Now, that's a great question. We think there are several aspects of unique differentiation and that's obviously why we were keen to work on the Trillium product. Number 1. This is ligand trap with an effusion to provide longer half-life. So, it has a lower binding to CD47 than a typical antibody. And it has shown both the in pre-clinical studies and now in clinical studies that you do not get the problematic on target anemia that you see with antibodies. So that's an important unique thing, it matters a lot, particularly for blood cancer patients which already have a fragile bone marrow function, but also for potential solid cancers that are treated with various chemotherapy backbone.  Number 2 is this product is to the best of my knowledge the only one that have showed single agent activity in blood cancers and we have the most advanced dataset coming out in lymphoid malignancies, both related to B-cell malignancies, lymphomas and myelomas. And we see opportunities to combine it with several existing Pfizer assets to give us unique life cycle management. So, several unique aspects, we look forward to posts -- to see potential deal closure, and to work with the staff in Trillium to accelerate these exciting assets. We're very intrigued by the use of mRNA for flu as it can generate both an antibody response against hemagglutinin and a T-cell response that can be protective, particularly for more severe flu cases. The current flu vaccine, the protein-based are not very potent on T-cell responses, and generate more intermediate level of antibodies. Whether you can register products on those type of immune parameters is something we are, of course, considering and as we generate data, we'll have dialogues with regulators. But, of course, advantageous not just to get the approvals but to have a strong data set on an outcome such as vaccine efficacy. The program will include both outcomes.  As always, you do not need inferiority of antibodies and you may have additional immune parameters that do not exist very much with the traditional flu, but the entire program will, of course, look at vaccine efficacy to also take into account, is broader immune response. But we'll obviously always keep our regulatory dialogues open for opportunities to serve patients as quick as possible. On the protocol change to Hem A we saw that we had some patients that got very high levels of Hem A gene therapy, 150%. We didn't see actual -- we have not recorded any issues in the haemophilia patients with this.  We want to just have an abundance of caution, to have a protocol that would allow active management. And of course, if there are any patient with some risk's factors, they could easily use oral anti-coagulants, such as Eliquis. I want to just put this into context as we finalize the regulatory submission on this protocol update, that having high Factor VIII level has also some potential longer-term advantage on sustainability of gene therapy. The Factor VIII data that you've seen also from others in the field have shown some more attenuation over time for the Factor VIII molecules. We have reported so far very good efficacy with no need for transfusion and no bleeding.  But to be in the upper range, where we are, on average 60% to 70%, maybe something that allow much longer gene therapy benefit than if you were on the lower end of the spectrum, particularly for Factor VIII patients. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for your interest in the standard risk oral PI trials. As I said, no other oral drug, actually the monoclonal antibodies were not used either. So, it's really unique population, which we also recognized as we enrolled the trial, it's enrolling now very well in the trial. And yes, we have secondary endpoints that we'll look at the 2 different groups. And I do think if the vaccine efficacy is what we hope, [Indiscernible] treatment efficacies, what we hope, that should be within our reach to get the claims on both vaccinated breakthrough and all commerce that includes unvaccinated. And as I said, it will be to the best of my knowledge, the only trial on standard risk debt are not vaccinated, but it has this unique opportunity where antibodies are difficult to use in vaccinated, and there is no other way of running it.  This is a growing population and in countries that may be late with revaccinations, of course, this is a really interesting drug profile. Also, for new variant, please remember, I didn't emphasize it that much, our oral PI, to date has shown robust activity against all variants of -- from Delta to Alpha variants, all variants we have tested, we believe it's going to be active against many different coronaviruses. So, Angela spoke about stockpiling. It also has a stockpiling opportunity for new things coming up in the Corona family, even if they're quite remote from SARS-Cov-2. So, it's a real important drug before the world and fingers crossed as we look forward to readout. I'm happy to say a few words. So, you were all -- -- The different profiles of protease inhibitor and polymerase and how that could play out and the need for REMS. Well, as always, we -- pending positive data, we are extremely experienced in pharmacovigilance programs, and we'll discuss with regulators what they see as the appropriate. For the high-risk group we'll have a five-day study and there could be then options for a polymerase or a protease inhibitor. And it could be an upside to even look at combination between those in the future. For the standard risk, to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that will be completing that study in a relative near-term, and actually the only one running it.  And for the household exposure study, there you are treating potentially healthy uninfected individuals, and as a physician, I would just say that the protease inhibitor class has been and is known to be addressing unique viral product and not really affecting the human cells. So, I would think it would be a very much preferred [Indiscernible] class if the profile comes out as we hope, polymerase inhibitor, nucleoside base, you're always concerned in healthy individuals whether they could incorporate into the genome. Whether the germ line or the mitochondrial genome, so I would think that's something you need to keep in consideration. But that's why we were keen to be working on an oral PI because it is broad utility [Indiscernible] to future variants and future coronaviruses. Yes. Thank you for -- Carter -- for asking about TL1A, it's a noble member of the TNFs super family. It's actually had some genetic association with IBD Crohn's disease a more severe Crohn's disease. We're by far the most advanced with our biological. And so far, we have not seen any meaningful impact of [Indiscernible] on activity of the drug in patients. So, we think we will be able to manage that. Of course, we are waiting for the final readout of the study. We think it could be a drug given conveniently subcutaneously. We are reporting based on a biomarker, first to my knowledge, to have a biomarker for selecting of high responders that captured still broader patient group.  And if you look at the efficacy in the biomark group, it's really above where any other agents have reported so far. And that's what we want to report and reproduced in the extended study. And this Tl1A is highly applicable not only to issue colitis, but also to Crohn's, so that's another indication where we will aim to go, which is supported also by genetic study. So, thank you very much for your interest in it and look forward to keep you updated as we generate more data and move on with this exciting program. Sorry about the -- yes."

            "content": "Thanks, Mikael. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine, once again, had a significant positive impact on our quarterly results and Albert has already addressed the key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement, revenue increased to a 130% operationally in the Third Quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution from direct sales and Alliance revenues as Albert said earlier, we saw a continuation of solid performance from the businesses again this quarter, delivering 7% operational revenue growth despite a negative 5% impact from price.  Getting us to a robust volume growth of 12% for the business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution. The 12% volume growth is in spite of an approximately 2% negative impact to growth from Chantix recall and distribution pause. This supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly growth rate to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least 6% CAGR through 2025. There was no impact from the number of selling days in the quarter as compared to the year-ago period, like we saw on our First Quarter, where we had more selling days compared to the year-ago period.  I'd remind you that the offset to this imbalance will be seen in the Fourth Quarter results, where we will have fewer selling days as compared to the year-ago quarter. For the full year, this results in essentially the same number of selling days in 21 as 2020. I will come back to this in a little bit when I discuss the updated guidance. The adjusted cost of sales increased shown here, reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 22% percentage points compared to the Third Quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased primarily due to a level of promotional spend, sales force activity, or similar to pre-pandemic levels. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter, was primarily driven by increased investments in COVID-19 related programs, as well as other programs within our pipeline.  The growth rate for reported diluted EPS was 445%, while adjusted diluted EPS grew a 129% [Indiscernible]. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 4% benefit to revenue, as well as a 4% benefit or $0.02 to adjusted diluted EPS. Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance. We have again provided total Company guidance which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. And then we provided some additional sub ledger details on our assumptions on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and the business without the COVID-19 vaccine. Our revenue guidance has increased, and we now expect total Company revenue to be in a range of $81 to $82 billion, increasing by $2.5 billion at the midpoint.  With the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year now expected to be approximately $36 billion, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion compared to our prior guidance. The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total Company revenue at the midpoint has increased to 44% as compared to 42% at our previous ' 21 guidance. I'll come back to that in a minute. We also adjusted our cost and expense guidance, mostly to reflect actual performance to date. Let me give you some more detail here. Adjusted cost of sales to range has decreased to between 39.1% to 39.6%.  On adjusted SI&A, we have tightened the range and now expect $11.6 to $12.1 billion a decrease for a $150 million at the midpoint. In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $10.4 to $10.9 billion, an increase of $400 million at the endpoint to reflect anticipated incremental spending on COVID-19 and other mRNA -based projects. We are keeping our assumption for the effective tax rate for the year flat compared to prior guidance at approximately 16%. This yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $4.13 to $4.18, or 84% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.  Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. As discussed earlier, the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split. Pfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 3 billion doses in total by the end of 2021. The $2.5 billion increase in expected COVID revenues to 36 billion primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-July, which was the cut-off for our prior guidance.  This assumes deliveries of approximately 2.3 billion doses in fiscal year 2021 compared to prior guidance of deliveries of 2.1 billion doses and continues to assume that we will produce 3 billion doses during calendar year 2021. This difference of 700 million doses represents doses which will be delivered in fiscal year 2022. To refresh your memory, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses, and a payment to BioNtech representing the 50% gross profit split. We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue.  This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs and spending on the COVID-19 protease inhibitor antiviral programs. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly decreased to 2021 revenue range to$ 45 to $46 billion. So, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint. The decrease in guidance at the midpoint largely reflects the impact from the [Indiscernible] and pause in shipments. Terms of adjusted diluted EPS without the contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, we have increased the range to be between 260 to 265 for the year which represents approximately 12% operational growth at the midpoint.  These growth rates are all consistent on how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation. You may notice that the implied Q4 guidance suggests non-COVID-19 operational revenue to decline by 1%, especially as compared to the revenue growth that we've seen year-to-date of 8%. Let me walk through the drivers of this. The largest driver of the decline, is a difference in number of selling days, compared to the comparable quarter in 2020. You will remember my discussion as extra selling days in Q1 when we had 3 more selling days in the U.S. and 4 more selling days in the international markets.  And I talked then about how Q4 would largely offset that impact, leaving 2021 as a whole with approximately the same number of selling days, 2020. In Q4, we will now have four fewer selling days each in domestic and international, eight less in total as compared to Q4, 2020. This is expected to decrease sales by approximately $600 million, and have a negative impact of the growth rate of 6% for the Company, excluding COVID vaccine sales. We expect the Chantix sales to be zero in Q4 due to recall and pause in shipments, representing another 2% headwind to growth.  And while it is not on normal practice to discuss 2022 outlook during the Q3 conference call, I wanted to make a brief comment related to potential Comirnaty sales next year, and we've noticed some estimates of those sales would be very high. While we have the capacity to produce 4 billion doses in 2022 at this point, we expect to recognize revenues for 1.7 billion doses in 2022, representing COVID vaccine direct sales and Alliance revenues approximately $29 billion. We continue to engage with governments regarding potential future orders for 2022 including doses for which certain governments have the option to order and take deliveries in 2022. And going forward, we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide.  In summary, a strong quarter and first nine months of the year, based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. We have increased our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year, mainly driven by increased expectations for Comirnaty sales. Our pipeline continues to advance and we have invested to support that advance. We look forward to an expected closing of the Trillium acquisition as soon as this quarter or in the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start to start the Q&A session. Thanks, Albert. Hi, Vamil. So, Vamil, the way I would think about '22 is kind of a rhythm that's similar to '21. And what I mean is, we'll continue to update the numbers for '22, based on the contracts that we've signed and then obviously the deliveries that will be shipped in '22 that go with those contracts. So, think about this year, as we've updated our guidance each quarter, we've been able to increase our revenue guidance to the COVID vaccine because of incremental contracts signed from one quarter to the next. We're using that same approach for 2022. So right now, 1.7 billion, I call that kind of banked, if you will, in terms of the doses and the $29 million that goes with that. Obviously, we've got to ship those doses, but we have contracts in hand that support the 1.7 billion doses and the $29 billion revenue. So that'll be the rhythm of the numbers, the way to think about it going forward in '22. Beyond '22, obviously, we're working our way through those numbers. We continue to believe that the vaccine has durability and that there will continue to be significant revenues beyond '22, but in terms of specifics there, we're continuing to work on that. Albert, I can turn that over to Angela if you'd like. And the increase on the IBT is a percentage of revenue for the COVID vaccines. Remember that IBT as a percentage of revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution, applicable royalty expense, and then the gross profit split with BNT so that gets you to I'll call it gross margin. And then we also include in that IBT percentage all of the R&D associated with COVID-related programs for both prevention and treatment and other mRNA-related programs. When you put all of that together, we've guided this year to IBT as percentage of revenues in the high 20s. For next year, you should assume the same thing and then obviously we'll provide updated guidance on all of the P&L line items on our next earnings call when we close out Q4, provide guidance for 2022. So, Carter, 3 billion doses this year, 4 billion doses next year. Quite frankly, I think as demand requires, we can continue to expand on our capacity. Just as an example, give you some of the improvements we've made. When we first thought of making the other vaccine, it took us 110 days from [Indiscernible]. We've taken 110 days down to 31 days, so over 70% improvement in terms of the process. And quite frankly, I think we continue to make more improvement, so I don't think capacity is going to be a challenge for us. I think just the matter of our making sure we're meeting the demand that's being generated by patients. And obviously by the contracts we generate and the like. But I don't see capacity as some constraining factor for us."

            "content": "Thanks, Albert. Thanks, Geoffrey. We see business development frankly as a very important part of our strategy and we plan to be very active in deal-making. Specifically, we're going to be interested in compelling later-stage assets that can contribute positively to the top-line growth in the back half of the decade, and we're also going to be interested in accessing medical breakthroughs that are in earlier stages of development.  And we frankly see, focusing in these areas as being much more value-creating than synergy-driven deals that require lots of resource-intensive integrations that can take a long time to complete. Obviously, we don't speak in absolutes and we never say never, but right now our focus will be as I described. On compelling later-stage assets and earlier-stage medical breakthroughs in biopharma."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Sure. Thank you. And maybe just one more add to that, which is that, as you look into '22 and also the out-years, as Frank said, we will update you as the contracts get confirmed. But many of our contracts already have been confirmed and those are multi-year contracts. So, we already know that looking into '22 and the out years, that there are some that are going to continue to be government-driven. And then maybe the one other thing that will change over the next in the foreseeable future, is just the development of a private market. And most likely, we'll see that developing in the U.S. sooner than the others, because that's -- ex-U.S. is where the multiyear contracts have already been secured.  But I think that that will be something -- a new dynamic that we are absolutely ready to manage. And we're already transitioning our portfolio. And if you look at the presentations of the vaccine that we have into smaller pack sizes, this instead of stability, different storage enhancements that we're making all with the view of preparing to transition into vaccinations in the community setting, and preparing for a durable business. So, I would just add that to what Frank just mentioned. For the biosimilar for [Indiscernible], we will have interchangeability studies and we're finding that in December 2021. Mikael? Well, the market that we're looking at, we estimate to be about 150 -- up to 150 million people. When we look at the -- just vaccination rate, infection rates, and then the various risk groups that we talked about today; the high risk, the low risk, as well as those who just maybe in contact with those that are infected, this is the size of population that we're looking at. I think that this opportunity will allow -- is a very attractive one.  And I think that, again, the disease patterns will determine where we go with this, but certainly, it looks to be a durable opportunity as well. And also, not to forget that this is probably something that governments would likely -- would be interested in stockpiling, like the way -- like we saw in the flu. I think that that's an additional commercial opportunity to consider here. Thanks for the question Chris. No, we are not all done with the developed markets. Certainly, the contracts are in place and many of them are in place. But also, don't forget that many of these contracts have options attached to them, and those have not been realized. So, I think that there is still opportunity in 2022 for the developed world to acquire additional doses. Sure. As we think about the Prevnar adult revenues, I think we have to look at it at the different age ranges. For the 65 plus, the opportunity will be obviously those who are aging in the nearly 65 that are becoming every year, as well as the opportunity and we're actually waiting for the CDC and MMWR to give us guidance as to whether those who have been previously vaccinated with PCV 13 will be candidates for re-vaccination. That's how I think about revenue on the 65 plus. And then in addition to that one, what is completely new is the 18 to 64 efforts. This is a whole new population. It is a large population. And this will be the other opportunity that we'll be looking to for PCV 20 in '22 and beyond. Andrew, I think on the Abro one as we have learned and we've talked about this in the past as well, we're just in a really different place now. We have a tremendous number of contracts that we have in place, you see that in the gross-to-net when you look at Xeljanz and work with these -- with the various payers. And it's continuing as -- with all new products when you launch, access and getting access is always a critical issue.  And so, we'll continue to do that as we have with all of our products for Abro, not to forget that obviously the profile that we have, the value that we can bring to patients as well as organizations is a big part of what's going to help us to be able to get that access. So, I think that we'll do what we've always done, and that access will build through time. And we believe that we do have a competitive profile that will allow us to play a role in this very, very big market. On your other question, which was related to the protease inhibitor, Andrew would you mind just repeating that again? Sure. I think the way to think about it is that the 1.7 billion doses that we talked about for '22, are those that we have line of cycle contracts for. And as Frank said, as contracts continue to be confirmed and finalized, will add to that. The spillover that you mentioned, which is the end of fiscal year but really not the end of calendar year, and so there is some -- there were some doses that were contracted for in 2021, but the revenue will be collected in 2022, so somewhere between December and January. I think the way to think about it is just that we have to look at contracts as well as revenue recognition and those are two -- they're two slightly different things."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like turn the conference over to your host Patrick Malloy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Malloy: Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We hope you had a chance to review the press release we issued this afternoon announcing our Q2 2021 financial results and key program updates. Joining me on today's call are Amit Munshi, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Stelzer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Doug Manion, our Executive Vice President of Research and Development; and joining us for the Q&A session will be our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Rob Lisicki. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about our goals, expectations, plans, beliefs, timing of events or future results, including those risks and uncertainties related to our pipeline, financial projections and the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business. Forward-looking statements involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties some of which may be beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks could be found in our earnings press release and our latest SEC disclosure documents. All forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to Arena, and we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Amit Munshi. Amit?\nAmit Munshi: Thanks Pat, and thanks everyone for jumping on today's call. I presume everyone's had a chance to review the press release we issued this afternoon where we announced some very important updates. I'll provide some initial comments and then Doug will take you through the program updates in more detail, and the ADVISE open label data set, and then we'll hand off to Laurie to walk through the Q2 financial performance. Following the prepared comments, we'll spend the remaining time on Q&A. Before we begin, I'd like to formally introduce our newly appointed Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development Dr. Doug Manion. Doug comes to Arena with 25 years of executive leadership experience across clinical research and drug development, with companies such as DuPont, Merck GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol Myers Squibb. Most recently, he was CEO of Kleo Pharmaceuticals. Doug's extensive experience, including experience in immunology and in our therapeutic areas will be instrumental as we continue to transform into a sustainable global organization. Turning to Slide 3, if you've been following the Arena story over the course of the past year, you'll know that in early '21, we laid out three strategic principles critical to our long-term growth. First, we plan to selectively and prudently grow our pipeline to support our long-term vision for the business. Second, we will continue to put all the pieces in place to ensure commercial launch success. And third, we continue to advance the build out of our leadership team that will maintain and grow culture for success. As you can see, we're progressing forward on all three of these principles. Turning now to Slide 4, last week, we took an important first step to bolster our mid stage pipeline within our core therapeutic areas with the announcement of our collaboration and option agreements with Aristea Therapeutics. We have a high bar for in licensing and collaboration agreements and over the course of the past year, we evaluated over 200 potential deals. Very few of these opportunities presented to us met our essential criteria; first, small molecules that were well characterized with chemistry and pharmacology; second, alignment within our current therapeutic area focuses of GI, dermatology and in cardiology; and three, limited financial exposure prior to program de risking. The deal with Aristea checks all three of the boxes. RIST4721 is an oral small molecule GPCR CXCR2 antagonist that was originated by AstraZeneca with strong pedigree in chemistry in oncology. As you can see from the slide, RIST4721 enhances our early to mid-stage clinical development pipeline, with a Phase IIb ready asset in palmoplantar pustulosis or PPP, and an opportunity to explore RIST4721s potential in hidradenitis suppurativa or HS and IBD through a couple of small exploratory trials. What is important to note is that this is a fiscally sound deal structure that includes a nominal upfront investment that grants us the option to acquire Aristea and a library of CXCR2 molecules based on the outcome of the Phase IIb PPP study and other supporting trials. Turning to Slide 5, in addition, the pipeline progress we made through the Aristea acquisition, I'm happy to share some important program updates. As most of you are aware, we are studying etrasimod a selective S1P receptor modulator in two global Phase three studies of ulcerative colitis. As we announced in January of this year, we reached full enrollment in our 52 week study, ELEVATE 52 that's that he remains on track for top line data readout in Q1 of '22. Today, I'm extremely excited to announce that our etrasimod ELEVATE 12 or UC 12 has reached full enrollment ahead of expectations. And with that I'll hand it off to Doug to provide additional details on etrasimod and the ELEVATE trial as well as other programs. Doug?\nDoug Manion: Thank you, Amit. And hi, everybody. With regards to the UC 12 study, we anticipate the biologic naive to biologic expose participant ratio will be 60 to 40, which is consistent with the split we saw in the OASIS Phase II UC study. As many of you will do math on the timelines, you will note that the UC 12 data will complete ahead of UC 52. With that in mind, we have developed a plan with our CRO IQVIA to keep the database unlocked, sequestered and the data blinded until both databases can be locked, unblinded and analyzed concurrently, as specified in our statistical analysis plan. I would like to thank the study participants, the clinical investigators and the entire Arena team for their extraordinary efforts that resulted in this study enrolling faster than anticipated. As we said previously, we will read out UC 12 and UC 52 data sets contemporaneously during the first quarter of 2022. As many of you know, we're also investigating etrasimod in the ongoing Phase II/III cultivates study in Crohn's disease. While we previously guided for a readout of sub-study A by the end of this year, we've made the decision to increase the sample size from 50 to 70 participants in order to enhance the veracity of this trial and these data. We believe this additional data will provide a pool data set that will be commensurate with other open label trials conducted with competing products. Importantly, this enhanced data may allow us to make sub-study 1 into registrational study and reduce the overall timeline for this program. Additionally, today, we announced entry into a collaboration with Second Genome to identify micro biomarkers in the CULTIVATE program. Crohn's disease is marked by substantial heterogeneity. So the potential to identify biomarkers associated with clinical response may be important to the ongoing design of the CULTIVATE program. With our target enrollment, moving from 50 to 70 participants and the potential of impact from the COVID-19 Delta variants spreading across multiple countries in Europe. We are projecting that the top line data for sub-study A will read out in Q2 of 2022. Now turning our attention to the etrasimod dermatology programs, in 2020, we began a small Phase II exploratory study in alopecia areata, investigating 2 milligram of etrasimod in participants with moderate to severe disease. Today, we announced that we're broadening the participation, the participant population in the study to include a more moderate patient population and adding a 3 milligram treatment arm with the aim of detecting a dose response in study participants. We believe that by taking the opportunity to execute this amendment now, and should the data be positive, will put ourselves in position to move directly to Phase III. With this protocol amendment, we now expect to read our top line data in the second half of 2022. And finally, I am very excited to present a recent data cut from the open label extension of our Phase II ADVICE study investigating etrasimod in atopic dermatitis. Can we turn to Slide 6 please, the data I'll be walking you through in a moment provide us with even greater confidence in the promise of etrasimod for patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. The open label extension program followed the completion of the 12 week placebo controlled ADVICE study period and a four week washout period. At that point, all of the participants who opted into the OLE which was 85% of the ADVISE study participants who completed the 12 week study received 2 milligrams of etrasimod. When looking at the 16 week data, in the OLE, we were pleased to see a consistent clinical improvement across key efficacy measures with no new safety signals to date through 56 weeks of follow up. Let's move on to Slide 7. I'd like to point out that within each chart, you'll notice the dashed lines across the bottom, which represents placebo rates at week 12 of the ADVISE study. We have extended these placebo rates for the sake of taking a conservative view of the OLE data. Also, we've taken an additional conservative approach when estimating the Delta at the 16 week time point of the OLE as we've applied a non-responder imputation shown by the blue line. As you look across the vIGA, EASI-75 and Peak Pruritis NRS, you'll note the consistent clinical improvement across each efficacy measure at week 16. Further at week 16 of the OLE, we observed a vIGA improvement of 47%. As a reminder, vIGA is the FDA registrational endpoint for Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis. When looking at EASI-75, we observed an improvement of 72% and a Peak Pruritis change of 61%. As you will note and with the appropriate caveats of both cross study comparisons, the data is in the range of approved biologics in a day, as are the relative deltas with placebo rates extrapolated from the initial 12 week period. As you can imagine, we are very enthusiastic about these data. While we're still in discussions with regulatory authorities around the world to establish the final Phase III design and protocol based on the OLE the data presented today, along with the review of the full data set, we've made the decision to anchor our Phase III program to a 2 milligram dose. With regards to timing, we anticipate commencing Phase III study activities in Q4 of 2021. Now I'll turn it back to Amit to highlight our upcoming catalysts. Amit?\nAmit Munshi: Thanks Doug. If we go to Slide 8 please, with the updates we presented today, you can see the next 12 to 18 months will be both busy and exciting. And looking at Q1 '22, we'll have data from UC 12 and UC 52 contemporaneously, followed by the enhanced and expanded CULTIVATE sub-study A in Q2. In the back half of 2022, our plan is to submit our NDA for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis pending positive data. We continue to work diligently across the organization in support of our NDA including ongoing work in areas such as clinical pharmacology, CMC, quality and regulatory. Also in the second half of '22, we will turn over several important data readouts, including etrasimod and alopecia areata with two and 3 milligrams and the expanded patient population, eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE and data from APD418 and temanogrel in their respective cardiovascular indications. Now I'll hand the call over to Laurie who will take you through the Q2 financial performance. Laurie?\nLaurie Stelzer: Thank you, Amit. Turning to Slide 9 for key financial measures, research and development expenses for the second quarter totaled $112.5 million, compared to $64.9 million in the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by advancement of our clinical trial programs, as well as an increase in personnel expenses as we staffed to support our program growth. Selling general and administrative expenses for the second quarter totaled $31.9 million, compared to $22.9 million in the same period in 2020. Net loss for the second quarter was $146.1 million, compared to a net loss of $84.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the second quarter was $2.40 compared to basic and diluted net loss per share of $1.61 for the same period in 2020. Operating cash burn in the second quarter was $93.8 million, compared to $77.8 million in the same period in the prior year. And as of June 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $1.0 billion, compared to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2021. And now I'll turn the call back over to Amit who will make some concluding remarks before opening the call to the Q&A session.\nAmit Munshi: Thanks Laurie. We'll go to Slide 10, please. In looking at Q2 performance, you can see we make continuous - we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio. And that now we have a direct line of sight to our Phase III ELEVATE data readout. Overall for the portfolio, we continue to evaluate the market, competitive and regulatory environment and where necessary, adapt our approaches of our science the best chance of providing a clear clinical signal. On atopic dermatitis, we continue to make strong progress and the open label data extension that we presented today gives us confidence in entering our Phase III program. And of course, finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position. I like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Arena team for the hard work and dedication as we continue to build towards the future of the company. With that operator, let's move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress with enrollment. Just two for me, one, on the alopecia areata study, I just wondered if you saw anything in the 2 mg that kind of - is informing your decision to kind of move into the 3 mg, any color there would be helpful. And then as you think about the completion of the enrollment of the UC study, are there things in consideration such as staffs being kind of enrolling during COVID that you guys have proactively been doing especially in light of some of the learning maybe from atopic and just wanted to get some color on that? Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Sure, let me start now. If I miss anything Doug, please jump in. On the AA study we're blinded to the data, so it's not a reflection of 2 milligram? As you know, in atopic derm we did not get a chance to explore the 3 milligram in a Phase II study, so we thought this was the right place and time to take a look at 3 milligrams. Importantly - and just as important as the 2 to 3 milligrams of expanding the patient population in the study. And then the final point, which I'll echo what Doug said in his prepared remarks, is that by increasing the study and making it more robust, we're moving this study from a proof of concept study to a study that could potentially take us directly to Phase III. So the overall program timeline gets get potentially diminished by doing that. So that's really the purpose of - to change that study. In terms of enrollment on etrasimod in ulcerative colitis, as you know, we've maintained a very high degree of touch in the trial. We continue to evaluate every patient every day, every day to entry to ensure that we have the strongest possible integrity of the trial. As I pointed out previously, discontinuation rates, and other interruptions of dosing, et cetera, are well below our pre-planned statistical expectations for the UC study. So we continue to be very positive about where that trial is heading, both in terms of the timelines as well as in terms of data integrity.\nAlethia Young: That's great. Thank you very much.\nAmit Munshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Neena Bitritto Garg from Citibank. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Dina on for Neena. I just have a quick question about the ELEVATE UC 12 study. How long will it take for analysis from the ELEVATE UC 12? Will it take a full eight weeks post the last patient visit report that path line data? Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, so as Doug pointed out, as folks will do the math and the trial timing may look earlier than UC 52. The data are intended to be analyzed together. So the end of the study would expect the normal time period in terms of analysis, but it also important to remember that the last patient out is really dependent on whether patients enroll in the OLE or not. So we'll know more about exactly how tight the timing is between two studies as we get towards the end of the - end of patient exposure, and we get the last patient out on study. So stay tuned. We're excited about where we're at with this and really pleased that the teams were able to execute on UC 12 in the middle of a COVID pandemic. Thanks for your question.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Howerton from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nChris Howerton: Fantastic. Thanks so much for taking the questions and super excited for the UC data too. So I guess maybe the question for me primarily is around what is the design of the CULTIVATE study? I'm feeling a little confused around the sub-study A, what sub-study 1 is and kind of how you see that becoming potentially registrational? And if you're willing to take a follow up question for me, I'm also curious what the status is of the extended release formulation is for etrasimod is, you have more clinical programs going on and more dose selection work going on, how does that layer into your thinking? Thanks.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah. Thanks for the question. The design of the CULTIVATE study starts with sub-study A. As you know that's a study that does not have a placebo control. It's just 2 and 3 milligrams. By expanding that study to 70 patients, we're able to get a pool of data set that's comparable to competitive products. We've done open label studies and moved directly on to registrational trials. So it really gives us the same size data set, and the robustness. And on top of that, we've got this collaboration on the biomarker side, which will help inform the overall program in time. The sub-study 1 was designed as a dose finding study between 2 and 3 milligrams in a placebo control setting. And at this point, should the sub-study A readout in line with our expectations, we would be in a position to power sub-study 1 to be the first to pivotal trial. So previously, we've contemplated sub-study 1 being a dose finding study and then moving to two large Phase III trials. In this case, we'd be able to power out the sub-study 1, if that makes sense.\nChris Howerton: That does. Thanks Amit.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah. And then the second question on the ER formulation, we continue to make good progress across the extended release. As you know, we've done some initial work on liquid formulation, so really try to pinpoint the exact curve we wanted to generate. And now what we're doing is we're looking across 2 and 3 milligrams and looking at broad range of potential formulations to begin to mimic that initial curve. So that work is ongoing and it's an iterative process. And we look at multiple different formulation methods, and there's a concentric circle between - concentric circles between being able to really identify the right formulation and developing new intellectual property. So as we've said before, the role of extended release is to both extend and expand the role of etrasimod, extend the intellectual property life and being able to expand into new indications. And so that work is ongoing and consistent with what we've said before. We hope to bridge that into the dermatology programs over time.\nChris Howerton: Okay, that's cool. Thanks Amit.\nAmit Munshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jessica Fye from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJessica Fye: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, given what's become a bit of an extended timeline for sub-study A, can you comment on where enrollment stands in the study just to give us a kind of a little progress update? How close are you to the originally planned 50 patients?\nAmit Munshi: Sure. So we don't comment on details of any study's enrollment. We are spot on where we expect to be on that study. But with Doug's arrival and taking a look at the competitive set, evaluating our regulatory potential path forward, we've made this change so that we can begin to move the overall program faster forward, so that's really the objective here.\nJessica Fye: Okay, so with Doug's arrival that's the reason why it's just happening now that you're deciding to enroll 70 patients and this wasn't a call you were able to make earlier.\nAmit Munshi: No, we were working on this earlier and working through regulatory implications. As you know, working through regulatory implications isn't the fastest process in the world. So we were already working through this prior to Doug's arrival and Doug's judgment here is extremely important with his broad range of expertise, really gave us confidence that we were making the right decision here.\nJessica Fye: Great and just last one for me, do you see pool safety data from sub-study A on an ongoing basis, maybe on a blinded basis? And given that the 3 milligram is - would be part of that pool data, anything you can comment on safety so far?\nAmit Munshi: Sure. So the safety is evaluated in a blinded fashion by external parties and the SMBs. And we haven't seen anything that would make us question our decision to go from 2 to 3 milligrams at this point.\nJessica Fye: Great, thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Thanks Jessica.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one on the current CULTIVATE study. Could you help us a little bit understand the patient characteristics background in the way that you have helped us to understand the UC program? And to get a sense whether any of the modification and enrollment from 50 to 70 patients there is taking any features of patients' exposure to biologics into account?\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, Hey, Chris, thanks. Yeah, there's no real difference in the additional 20 or so patients who will be adding to study from the original 50. As you know, working moderate to severe Crohn's. There's some very clear defined guidelines in terms of the patients we want in that study. And it's consistent with what everyone else has studied. I think this is the challenge in Crohn's broadly, which is, it's a narrow subset. Crohn's, as you know, has a lot of heterogeneity as Doug pointed out, and these studies are all designed to evaluate a very narrow subset of patients consistent with what other competitive products have seen. So Doug, Rob, anything to add to that?\nDoug Manion: This is Doug. Only to say that, yeah, we've kept the inclusion criteria as it is. We've just expanded the sample size. So we have more veracity with the data set on which we're basing our decisions. But the hope would be that we can be bullish in terms of the next phase of human experimentation.\nChris Shibutani: Got it and then the follow up would be on advise atopic dermatitis. You gave us a snapshot of a work that you did in July. I think previously, you've said that you'd be doing a more fuller presentation of the data sometime in the back half of this year, should we still anticipate that and roughly when and that would be helpful to get insight.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, so the data that we presented today is a relatively fulsome set. We'll continue to evaluate the open label data over time. We expect to present this data in an upcoming medical conference and we're working through that now. So this will get presented in a forum. But as I think you can see from the data just gives us additional confidence that the outcomes that we're seeing here, even with the elevated placebo rates we saw in first 12 week are actually quite robust and in line with other agents. So again, consistent with the safety profile of the etrasimod being a once a day oral, not having the liabilities of JAK inhibitors and being able to deliver efficacy that's in the range of the approved biologics. We're incredibly excited about where this is heading and we think there's a substantial market opportunity in front of us.\nChris Shibutani: And just to be clear the word anchor on 2 milligrams, does that mean that 3 milligrams is not part of the go forward AD plan or is it predominant?\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, so it's not part of the Phase III plan. That's correct.\nChris Shibutani: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joseph Schwartz from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nJoseph Schwartz: Thanks very much. Maybe I'll ask about your new collaboration with Second Genome to analyze patient responses in CULTIVATE. What's the null hypothesis there? Is it that patients who are more dysbiotic have worse responses to etrasimod or need higher doses? And what do you do with the findings that you uncover? Will you report them along with the top line CULTIVATE data? Would you expect to enrich enrollment in Phase III, just talk a little bit more about your plans there?\nAmit Munshi: Sure. Joe, so let me start and I'll then hand it off to Doug. The reason to do this is really the heterogeneity that Doug pointed out and to the extent we can begin to really understand the impact of etrasimod. We've talked extensively before about etrasimod's role beyond just migration of T-lymphocytes. We've talked about activity on tight junction protein [ph]; we've talked about activity on the innate immune system. And so we're really excited to see where these biomarkers come out. Doug you want to lend some more color on it?\nDoug Manion: Yeah, just to say that we all know that dysbiosis is an important feature here. I think there is not a lot of literature on the quantification dysbiosis. So we're not going in with a priori notion of what that's going to turn up other than we'll do exploratory studies to see if there is a cut point in terms of response rates that might predispose us then to stratify or enrich and the Phase III program. And having done work in the Crohn's space a lot it is an extremely difficult population to homogenise. So if we can find any biomarkers that could help to predict who's going to respond better, I think it's going to significant chance to the likelihood of success in Phase III.\nJoseph Schwartz: Okay, thanks. And then can I just ask about your dose selection and how you're thinking about dose selection for Phase III in atopic derm? It sounds like you're settling on two mgs of the high dose, is that right? And can you give us some of your thoughts around, where - is two, does two really seem like the top end of the dose response curve? It seems like at first you thought that and then you were considering going higher. So if you can just give us an update on your latest thoughts there. That'd be great.\nAmit Munshi: Sure. So let me answer that question by handing off to Rob to talk about the data we presented today and how it stacks up competitively. And why we're excited to anchor the Phase III program on to 2 milligram. Rob can you shed a little bit of color on what these numbers look like relative to the competitive set.\nRob Lisicki: Yeah. Thanks Amit. I'll be happy to. Good afternoon, everyone. Pleasure to join you. When we looked at the open label extension data, we're able to compare that to all of the approved drugs and the drugs that are currently in Phase II, Phase III. When you look at that data, you see a response across all domains and all endpoints that is in line with what you would see with just success, right, cross trial comparisons, different time points, all those caveats. But when you look at the response, it's in line with what's actually being seen with JAK inhibitors. Given that the response is so robust and continues to improve over time and there's no safety signals that have been observed through 56 weeks of exposure. We're confident that 2 milligrams is sufficient dose for this particular TA based on the profile of the molecule and the responses that we see.\nJoseph Schwartz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Gerberry from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Sean for Jason. Thanks for taking up the questions. Maybe first one, just a quick follow up on the enrollment of the size for the sub-study A. Can you confirm whether the 20 additional patients, are they evenly split between the 2 milligram and the 3 milligram?\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, we'll continue to randomize 2 versus 3. Correct.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it and I guess I'm curious your thoughts as to exploring micro biomarker, a lot of that data so far on - at least on microbiome as a treatment modality is mainly on ulcerative colitis. Maybe can you talk about how - like of what those data sets are to exploring micro biomarkers for Crohn's disease? And if not can you compare and contrast micro biomarker versus microbiome as a treatment modality for IBD?\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, let me hand that off to Doug.\nDoug Manion: Sorry. Thank you for the question. So we're open minded. So we'll look first and foremost at the impact of our treatments on dysbiosis in the Crohn's disease setting, but also look to see what the baseline dysbiosis status was and to see whether or not there's indicators of individuals who actually have better improvement than others in terms of their Crohn's disease symptomatology.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah. I'd just add one more thing, which is we're not discussing treatments against the microbiome; we're just looking at biomarkers in the microbiome as it relates to SNP modulation. And we think, to Doug's point, if we can create more homogeneity in the patient population that combined with the larger data set will allow us to be far more expeditious, and fiscally prudent in designing the remainder of the program.\nUnidentified Analyst: And curious if you're able to find a plan in terms of what patients respond to your therapy? How response that you trust are better as an opportunity for you to decide a more robust file, perhaps with a smaller data set, because you're enriching certain population, they're more likely to respond, just curious thinking about maybe later stage trial design and timeline for market, that sort of question.\nAmit Munshi: Sure, yeah. We won't get into the timelines on this, but Doug, if you want to take the first part of that question.\nDoug Manion: Yeah, again, thank you for the question. The two edged sword with enrichment, of course is if you need some biomarker to stratify, then you would need to validate that biomarkers. So we're not hell bent on the idea that one must do that, we'd still prefer to take an all comers approach, although if there's a way for us to enrich for individuals who have a greater likelihood of benefiting from our drug, we'll certainly do so. And always, our goal here is to try to have the most efficient Phase III clinical trials as possible in terms of time and cost and the number of patients necessary to get to a result that could help us convince regulators to approve the drug for that indication. So we're doing everything that we can to try to expedite the medicinal value of the trails involved in that setting.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it and maybe just one last question from me on AD, thanks for the updates with the OLE data and appreciate the trending up of the EC score, and also the IGA score. So I'm just curious is that if any thoughts as to what is driving the increase in benefits over time, is it durational therapy? Is it because you no longer have those protocol compliance that may have - interfere with your ability to interpret the efficacy data in the placebo control part? Or do you have any sort of AD natural history cohort that sort of address whether there might be an evolution of placebo rate over time.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah. I think the most important striking finding that we had from the ADVICE double blind portion was that there was no plateau of effect. We made that point earlier in the year across and we've looked at as a patient by patient basis, we continue to see increase from eight weeks to 12 weeks, with no plateau of effect. So looking at 16 weeks was an important point for us. Recall that these patients were all washed out for four weeks before - we put back on 2 milligrams of etrasimod. So from that perspective it's cleaner ways, you can look at in open label study, to look at the effect size for etrasimod, and at 16 you can see - at 16 weeks you can see, again, a very robust response.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome, thanks so much for the color. Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Thanks to you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Stringer from Needham. Your line is open.\nJoseph Stringer: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. Going back to the alopecia trail, you're adding the higher remake dose here. Just curious if you can expand a little bit on sort of the expanded patient population subtype, is that - how should we think about that? Is that based on potentially disease severity and baseline SALT scores and is that expanding into additional subtypes here? That stratified are possible in 2 mg and 3 mg arms. Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, so yeah, we would stratify for 2 and 3 milligrams. The idea here is to give more alopecia areata patients as opposed to [indiscernible] patients, so we could address a broader subset. Recall also that we're treating for 24 weeks in this study, and we're talking about resident T-lymphocytes being cytotoxic at the hair follicle. So having sufficient time to be able to make an impact here has everything to do with being able to have that 24 week treatment period. So yes, we're looking at about 2 to 3 milligrams and expanding more to alopecia areata as opposed to [indiscernible] patients, so we'll get a broader subset of patients. And based on that, we think the expanded stuff here will allow us to make a more informed decision about how to move to Phase III.\nDoug Manion: And Amit, just to add, so we're going down to a SALT score at entry of 25 or more, 25 to 95, up from 15 to 95. And at the end of the day, with the added enrollment, we should have an even split between placebo 2 milligrams and 2 milligrams for approximately 26 or 27 patients per arm.\nJoseph Stringer: Great, thanks for taking our question.\nDoug Manion: Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nYatin Suneja: Hey, guys thank you for taking my question, just two for me. First on CULTIVATE sub-study did you take a look at - or were there any analysis of the data that led you to increase the sample size or you just increased based on - like without looking at the data? That's the first question.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, we're blinded to the data. So we made this decision based on having a data set that would allow us to really think about sub-study as a pivotal study. That was the driver. We're, again, we're blinded to the data.\nYatin Suneja: Okay. And then with regard to the UC 12, can you talk about how the patient mix might be looking between the biologic naive unexposed patient and how would that compare to 52?\nAmit Munshi: So 52, we announced 70-30 split. This is trimming closer to what we saw an OASIS, which is about a 60-40 split.\nYatin Suneja: Okay, got it and just to confirm, you will be analyzing these data sets together both UC 12, even though that one most likely will be sort of done before 52.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, Doug, do you want to just expand on that?\nDoug Manion: Yeah, so they'll be analyzed contemporaneously. So we will do at the same time. So the plan would be to actually keep the database unlocked for UC 12 until a time where approximate to when we're going to walk the database with UC 52. And then run the analyses on each of the studies at the same time and then subsequently do pooled analysis as will be needed for the ISS and the IC of the NDA submission to the US FDA.\nYatin Suneja: Okay, helpful. Just one final question, maybe on the expenses side, could you give an update on how the expenses are going to ramp up for the second half or for the rest of the year and maybe in 2022?\nAmit Munshi: So Laurie do you want to take that?\nLaurie Stelzer: Yeah, certainly, we haven't given guidance for '21 or '22 yet on cash burn. But what I can tell you is we did have a $214 million cash burn in the first half of '21. And then obviously, we have increasing patient enrollment in all of our studies and advancement in all of our studies, so we would expect somewhat.\nYatin Suneja: Got it, thank you so much.\nAmit Munshi: Thanks Yatin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Prakhar Agrawal from JonesTrading. Your line is open. Hi,\nPrakhar Agrawal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on ADERM Phase IIIa trail. Just wanted to clarify if there are any other changes in the Phase III trial that we should expect compared to ADVICE to minimize the high placebo effect that you saw in the Phase II? Secondary it's more on commercial in our conversations with KOLs suggests that Symposia. Bristol Myers, SNP that recently launched has been limited to treatment refractory UC patients. I know there's still a long way to go, but you just wondering if you had any thoughts on the implications of [indiscernible] and their pricing in UC to how you're thinking about your commercialization strategy. Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Sure. So let me - let's start with the commercialization question. Rob, do you want to take that please?\nRob Lisicki: Yeah. I'm happy to. Thanks. Amit. It's early. Their approval was May 27. So we're looking at just a few weeks of data where they've been in market, their relative access within the market is pretty limited. So right now for most payers are limited behind other agents. I think another consideration is the price stands out a bit in the UC market. It's 90,000 per year. That's much higher than competitive choices and other therapies. The other piece too is that there is - one of the key differences between the work that they did and the work that we're doing is to try to generate and demonstrate value for the molecule for payers prior to launch. That's the GLADIATOR study. So my assumption would be they're engaged with payers right now and they're negotiating. So their access is very limited to a small group of patients, which is why you're likely hearing that from OLs.\nAmit Munshi: I'm sorry. Can you repeat the first part of the question again?\nPrakhar Agrawal: Yeah, on the Phase III ADERM trial, any other trial design changes compared to ADVICE that we can expect?\nAmit Munshi: Yeah, so what we said in the Phase III program is, we have a substantial amount of moderate patients in the Phase II study, and we'll be looking for more of a contemporary split between moderate to severe atopic derm patients closer to 50-50. If you recall, we were thinking at 3%, moderate, at baseline, so we're looking for more moderate to severe patients, and so be a much more contemporary split in the modest of your population.\nPrakhar Agrawal: Thank you.\nAmit Munshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hoang from SMBC. Your line is open.\nDavid Hoang: Hey, thanks so much for the update and taking my question. So I just a couple. Can you talk a little bit about the GLADIATOR study in moderate patience? So what's the status of that, any relevant updates for that one? And are there - is there a timeline towards top line data?\nAmit Munshi: So for GLADIATOR that study is enrolling and we expect to have top line data to carry approval studies and we expect to have top line data shortly after approval, as Rob pointed out to really work with the payers on that with that data set to really drive greater payer access. So it's still ways down and the study is enrolling now.\nDavid Hoang: Okay, thanks. And then just quickly, I know you folks have commented on a few different ways, but I kind of wanted to ask the question in terms of atopic derm Phase III, it sounds like you're pretty confident in 2 milligram dose, but as you see more 3 milligram data from Crohn's and alopecia areata. Is it possible that kind of influences your thinking and you may be open to any type of protocol and then it's the 2 to 3 milligram arm or again is 2 milligram the dose that we all really should be looking at here?\nAmit Munshi: Yeah. So the Phase III program, its two milligrams we reserve the right to go back and look at 3 milligrams in a separate set of studies. But the 2 milligrams is what will go on the Phase III. And as you saw from the data that was presented, the 16 week data, the effect continues to increase, we're seeing a very safe product out to week 56. And we're seeing rates of EASI-75, IGA and the Peak Pruritis score that are in line with the market leader. So we're doing that with a once a day oral, so we feel very good about where that 2 milligram is coming out. And as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time with excellent advisors, staring at this open label data. And it's been very encouraging to hear from experts in the field about this data and how it validates 2 milligrams. As I pointed out on a previous question from the ADVICE portion, we saw that acceleration of effect from week eight to 12 and so continuing that lack of plateau really takes us out to 16. And, and so that delta feels very comfortable for us in terms of being able to think about Phase III program.\nDavid Hoang: Okay, understood. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nAmit Munshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from to line up Jason Butler from JMP securities. Your line is open.\nJason Butler: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two for me, first, do you have any data for etrasimod that looks specifically at a direct impact on microbiome? And I get that you're not trying to show that, but have you ruled out that you don't have a direct impact on the microbiome? And then secondly, looking past the UC study readouts, are there ancillary clinical studies, preclinical work or CMC work that could become rate limiting to an NDA submission? Thanks.\nAmit Munshi: Yeah. Doug, do you want to take the first part of that, and I'll take the second part.\nDoug Manion: Sorry, could you repeat the first part again?\nJason Butler: Have you ruled out that etrasimod has a direct impact on the microbiome? If you're looking at what the indirect impacts on the microbiome treatment would be, have you just ruled out that you don't have a baseline effects directly in the gut?\nDoug Manion: So we believe from our preclinical models that we do not, but that's one of the things that we'll be exploring more intensely in the human studies with the collaboration that we just announced with the Second Genome.\nAmit Munshi: Okay, and then the second part, looking past the UC studies, there's nothing rate limiting. We've been working for well over a year on making sure the clean form and quality systems necessary as well as the CMC are all in place toward the NDA. So there's nothing rate limiting beyond getting the studies completed.\nJason Butler: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKennen MacKay: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and great to hear about the UC 12 recruitment completion, big congrats there. Doug, maybe another question on that 2 milligram dose in AD just wondering what the drivers were behind that decision to move forward with that? Did that just converge versus 1 milligram over time or really sort of, again, what the driver was there? And separately, just thinking about the 3 milligram dose in alopecia areata, are there any disease ideologies or biology there that dictate that higher dose? Or is that sort of just a result of following the data? Thanks and looking forward to that UC data. Thank you.\nDoug Manion: Thanks. Thanks for the question. So yeah, we feel very comfortable with the 2 milligram dose in the larger populations in which we're currently testing and most importantly, all the work that we're doing in UC. We have margins we feel there's reason to probe 3 milligrams in more refractory diseases like Crohn's and alopecia areata. And we'll see what those results show both in terms of efficacy and safety and make the right decision in terms of dosing moving forward for those indications. And as Amit already stated you never say never. So if in fact we see that 3 milligrams in select indications is in safe and more effective. And we think that the ability for us to probe it in diseases like atopic dermatitis and by the way, the regulatory agencies have a lot to say about that then we'll proceed in consultation with that.\nOperator: I'm showing no further showing questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Amit Munshi.\nAmit Munshi: Great, thank you, everybody, for being on the call today. As you see, we continue to make significant progress across the portfolio Overall, we continue to evaluate market competitive and regulatory environments and as necessary adapter approaches to shorten the overall timelines for programs and get really our science the best chance of providing a clinical signal that's really important to us. And we think the changes we continue to make on these studies are all designed to really accelerate the overall programs. We're excited about anchoring on 2 milligrams for atopic derm, given the 16 week data we presented today. And I'd like to just conclude again by thanking the Arena team for their incredible hard work and dedication across the portfolio. But specifically call out the ELEVATE team at Arena for being able to really in the face of a lot of external and noise around the pandemic being able to execute these studies in a way that's ahead of schedule as well as maintaining strict data integrity. So thank you again, for everyone jumping on the call, and look forward to continued conversations.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks Amit. I'll be happy to. Good afternoon, everyone. Pleasure to join you. When we looked at the open label extension data, we're able to compare that to all of the approved drugs and the drugs that are currently in Phase II, Phase III. When you look at that data, you see a response across all domains and all endpoints that is in line with what you would see with just success, right, cross trial comparisons, different time points, all those caveats. But when you look at the response, it's in line with what's actually being seen with JAK inhibitors. Given that the response is so robust and continues to improve over time and there's no safety signals that have been observed through 56 weeks of exposure. We're confident that 2 milligrams is sufficient dose for this particular TA based on the profile of the molecule and the responses that we see. Yeah. I'm happy to. Thanks. Amit. It's early. Their approval was May 27. So we're looking at just a few weeks of data where they've been in market, their relative access within the market is pretty limited. So right now for most payers are limited behind other agents. I think another consideration is the price stands out a bit in the UC market. It's 90,000 per year. That's much higher than competitive choices and other therapies. The other piece too is that there is - one of the key differences between the work that they did and the work that we're doing is to try to generate and demonstrate value for the molecule for payers prior to launch. That's the GLADIATOR study. So my assumption would be they're engaged with payers right now and they're negotiating. So their access is very limited to a small group of patients, which is why you're likely hearing that from OLs."

            "name": "Doug Manion",
            "content": "Thank you, Amit. And hi, everybody. With regards to the UC 12 study, we anticipate the biologic naive to biologic expose participant ratio will be 60 to 40, which is consistent with the split we saw in the OASIS Phase II UC study. As many of you will do math on the timelines, you will note that the UC 12 data will complete ahead of UC 52. With that in mind, we have developed a plan with our CRO IQVIA to keep the database unlocked, sequestered and the data blinded until both databases can be locked, unblinded and analyzed concurrently, as specified in our statistical analysis plan. I would like to thank the study participants, the clinical investigators and the entire Arena team for their extraordinary efforts that resulted in this study enrolling faster than anticipated. As we said previously, we will read out UC 12 and UC 52 data sets contemporaneously during the first quarter of 2022. As many of you know, we're also investigating etrasimod in the ongoing Phase II/III cultivates study in Crohn's disease. While we previously guided for a readout of sub-study A by the end of this year, we've made the decision to increase the sample size from 50 to 70 participants in order to enhance the veracity of this trial and these data. We believe this additional data will provide a pool data set that will be commensurate with other open label trials conducted with competing products. Importantly, this enhanced data may allow us to make sub-study 1 into registrational study and reduce the overall timeline for this program. Additionally, today, we announced entry into a collaboration with Second Genome to identify micro biomarkers in the CULTIVATE program. Crohn's disease is marked by substantial heterogeneity. So the potential to identify biomarkers associated with clinical response may be important to the ongoing design of the CULTIVATE program. With our target enrollment, moving from 50 to 70 participants and the potential of impact from the COVID-19 Delta variants spreading across multiple countries in Europe. We are projecting that the top line data for sub-study A will read out in Q2 of 2022. Now turning our attention to the etrasimod dermatology programs, in 2020, we began a small Phase II exploratory study in alopecia areata, investigating 2 milligram of etrasimod in participants with moderate to severe disease. Today, we announced that we're broadening the participation, the participant population in the study to include a more moderate patient population and adding a 3 milligram treatment arm with the aim of detecting a dose response in study participants. We believe that by taking the opportunity to execute this amendment now, and should the data be positive, will put ourselves in position to move directly to Phase III. With this protocol amendment, we now expect to read our top line data in the second half of 2022. And finally, I am very excited to present a recent data cut from the open label extension of our Phase II ADVICE study investigating etrasimod in atopic dermatitis. Can we turn to Slide 6 please, the data I'll be walking you through in a moment provide us with even greater confidence in the promise of etrasimod for patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. The open label extension program followed the completion of the 12 week placebo controlled ADVICE study period and a four week washout period. At that point, all of the participants who opted into the OLE which was 85% of the ADVISE study participants who completed the 12 week study received 2 milligrams of etrasimod. When looking at the 16 week data, in the OLE, we were pleased to see a consistent clinical improvement across key efficacy measures with no new safety signals to date through 56 weeks of follow up. Let's move on to Slide 7. I'd like to point out that within each chart, you'll notice the dashed lines across the bottom, which represents placebo rates at week 12 of the ADVISE study. We have extended these placebo rates for the sake of taking a conservative view of the OLE data. Also, we've taken an additional conservative approach when estimating the Delta at the 16 week time point of the OLE as we've applied a non-responder imputation shown by the blue line. As you look across the vIGA, EASI-75 and Peak Pruritis NRS, you'll note the consistent clinical improvement across each efficacy measure at week 16. Further at week 16 of the OLE, we observed a vIGA improvement of 47%. As a reminder, vIGA is the FDA registrational endpoint for Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis. When looking at EASI-75, we observed an improvement of 72% and a Peak Pruritis change of 61%. As you will note and with the appropriate caveats of both cross study comparisons, the data is in the range of approved biologics in a day, as are the relative deltas with placebo rates extrapolated from the initial 12 week period. As you can imagine, we are very enthusiastic about these data. While we're still in discussions with regulatory authorities around the world to establish the final Phase III design and protocol based on the OLE the data presented today, along with the review of the full data set, we've made the decision to anchor our Phase III program to a 2 milligram dose. With regards to timing, we anticipate commencing Phase III study activities in Q4 of 2021. Now I'll turn it back to Amit to highlight our upcoming catalysts. Amit? This is Doug. Only to say that, yeah, we've kept the inclusion criteria as it is. We've just expanded the sample size. So we have more veracity with the data set on which we're basing our decisions. But the hope would be that we can be bullish in terms of the next phase of human experimentation. Yeah, just to say that we all know that dysbiosis is an important feature here. I think there is not a lot of literature on the quantification dysbiosis. So we're not going in with a priori notion of what that's going to turn up other than we'll do exploratory studies to see if there is a cut point in terms of response rates that might predispose us then to stratify or enrich and the Phase III program. And having done work in the Crohn's space a lot it is an extremely difficult population to homogenise. So if we can find any biomarkers that could help to predict who's going to respond better, I think it's going to significant chance to the likelihood of success in Phase III. Sorry. Thank you for the question. So we're open minded. So we'll look first and foremost at the impact of our treatments on dysbiosis in the Crohn's disease setting, but also look to see what the baseline dysbiosis status was and to see whether or not there's indicators of individuals who actually have better improvement than others in terms of their Crohn's disease symptomatology. Yeah, again, thank you for the question. The two edged sword with enrichment, of course is if you need some biomarker to stratify, then you would need to validate that biomarkers. So we're not hell bent on the idea that one must do that, we'd still prefer to take an all comers approach, although if there's a way for us to enrich for individuals who have a greater likelihood of benefiting from our drug, we'll certainly do so. And always, our goal here is to try to have the most efficient Phase III clinical trials as possible in terms of time and cost and the number of patients necessary to get to a result that could help us convince regulators to approve the drug for that indication. So we're doing everything that we can to try to expedite the medicinal value of the trails involved in that setting. And Amit, just to add, so we're going down to a SALT score at entry of 25 or more, 25 to 95, up from 15 to 95. And at the end of the day, with the added enrollment, we should have an even split between placebo 2 milligrams and 2 milligrams for approximately 26 or 27 patients per arm. Thank you. Yeah, so they'll be analyzed contemporaneously. So we will do at the same time. So the plan would be to actually keep the database unlocked for UC 12 until a time where approximate to when we're going to walk the database with UC 52. And then run the analyses on each of the studies at the same time and then subsequently do pooled analysis as will be needed for the ISS and the IC of the NDA submission to the US FDA. Sorry, could you repeat the first part again? So we believe from our preclinical models that we do not, but that's one of the things that we'll be exploring more intensely in the human studies with the collaboration that we just announced with the Second Genome. Thanks. Thanks for the question. So yeah, we feel very comfortable with the 2 milligram dose in the larger populations in which we're currently testing and most importantly, all the work that we're doing in UC. We have margins we feel there's reason to probe 3 milligrams in more refractory diseases like Crohn's and alopecia areata. And we'll see what those results show both in terms of efficacy and safety and make the right decision in terms of dosing moving forward for those indications. And as Amit already stated you never say never. So if in fact we see that 3 milligrams in select indications is in safe and more effective. And we think that the ability for us to probe it in diseases like atopic dermatitis and by the way, the regulatory agencies have a lot to say about that then we'll proceed in consultation with that."

            "name": "Amit Munshi",
            "content": "Thanks Pat, and thanks everyone for jumping on today's call. I presume everyone's had a chance to review the press release we issued this afternoon where we announced some very important updates. I'll provide some initial comments and then Doug will take you through the program updates in more detail, and the ADVISE open label data set, and then we'll hand off to Laurie to walk through the Q2 financial performance. Following the prepared comments, we'll spend the remaining time on Q&A. Before we begin, I'd like to formally introduce our newly appointed Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development Dr. Doug Manion. Doug comes to Arena with 25 years of executive leadership experience across clinical research and drug development, with companies such as DuPont, Merck GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol Myers Squibb. Most recently, he was CEO of Kleo Pharmaceuticals. Doug's extensive experience, including experience in immunology and in our therapeutic areas will be instrumental as we continue to transform into a sustainable global organization. Turning to Slide 3, if you've been following the Arena story over the course of the past year, you'll know that in early '21, we laid out three strategic principles critical to our long-term growth. First, we plan to selectively and prudently grow our pipeline to support our long-term vision for the business. Second, we will continue to put all the pieces in place to ensure commercial launch success. And third, we continue to advance the build out of our leadership team that will maintain and grow culture for success. As you can see, we're progressing forward on all three of these principles. Turning now to Slide 4, last week, we took an important first step to bolster our mid stage pipeline within our core therapeutic areas with the announcement of our collaboration and option agreements with Aristea Therapeutics. We have a high bar for in licensing and collaboration agreements and over the course of the past year, we evaluated over 200 potential deals. Very few of these opportunities presented to us met our essential criteria; first, small molecules that were well characterized with chemistry and pharmacology; second, alignment within our current therapeutic area focuses of GI, dermatology and in cardiology; and three, limited financial exposure prior to program de risking. The deal with Aristea checks all three of the boxes. RIST4721 is an oral small molecule GPCR CXCR2 antagonist that was originated by AstraZeneca with strong pedigree in chemistry in oncology. As you can see from the slide, RIST4721 enhances our early to mid-stage clinical development pipeline, with a Phase IIb ready asset in palmoplantar pustulosis or PPP, and an opportunity to explore RIST4721s potential in hidradenitis suppurativa or HS and IBD through a couple of small exploratory trials. What is important to note is that this is a fiscally sound deal structure that includes a nominal upfront investment that grants us the option to acquire Aristea and a library of CXCR2 molecules based on the outcome of the Phase IIb PPP study and other supporting trials. Turning to Slide 5, in addition, the pipeline progress we made through the Aristea acquisition, I'm happy to share some important program updates. As most of you are aware, we are studying etrasimod a selective S1P receptor modulator in two global Phase three studies of ulcerative colitis. As we announced in January of this year, we reached full enrollment in our 52 week study, ELEVATE 52 that's that he remains on track for top line data readout in Q1 of '22. Today, I'm extremely excited to announce that our etrasimod ELEVATE 12 or UC 12 has reached full enrollment ahead of expectations. And with that I'll hand it off to Doug to provide additional details on etrasimod and the ELEVATE trial as well as other programs. Doug? Thanks Doug. If we go to Slide 8 please, with the updates we presented today, you can see the next 12 to 18 months will be both busy and exciting. And looking at Q1 '22, we'll have data from UC 12 and UC 52 contemporaneously, followed by the enhanced and expanded CULTIVATE sub-study A in Q2. In the back half of 2022, our plan is to submit our NDA for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis pending positive data. We continue to work diligently across the organization in support of our NDA including ongoing work in areas such as clinical pharmacology, CMC, quality and regulatory. Also in the second half of '22, we will turn over several important data readouts, including etrasimod and alopecia areata with two and 3 milligrams and the expanded patient population, eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE and data from APD418 and temanogrel in their respective cardiovascular indications. Now I'll hand the call over to Laurie who will take you through the Q2 financial performance. Laurie? Thanks Laurie. We'll go to Slide 10, please. In looking at Q2 performance, you can see we make continuous - we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio. And that now we have a direct line of sight to our Phase III ELEVATE data readout. Overall for the portfolio, we continue to evaluate the market, competitive and regulatory environment and where necessary, adapt our approaches of our science the best chance of providing a clear clinical signal. On atopic dermatitis, we continue to make strong progress and the open label data extension that we presented today gives us confidence in entering our Phase III program. And of course, finally, we continue to maintain a strong cash position. I like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Arena team for the hard work and dedication as we continue to build towards the future of the company. With that operator, let's move to Q&A. Sure, let me start now. If I miss anything Doug, please jump in. On the AA study we're blinded to the data, so it's not a reflection of 2 milligram? As you know, in atopic derm we did not get a chance to explore the 3 milligram in a Phase II study, so we thought this was the right place and time to take a look at 3 milligrams. Importantly - and just as important as the 2 to 3 milligrams of expanding the patient population in the study. And then the final point, which I'll echo what Doug said in his prepared remarks, is that by increasing the study and making it more robust, we're moving this study from a proof of concept study to a study that could potentially take us directly to Phase III. So the overall program timeline gets get potentially diminished by doing that. So that's really the purpose of - to change that study. In terms of enrollment on etrasimod in ulcerative colitis, as you know, we've maintained a very high degree of touch in the trial. We continue to evaluate every patient every day, every day to entry to ensure that we have the strongest possible integrity of the trial. As I pointed out previously, discontinuation rates, and other interruptions of dosing, et cetera, are well below our pre-planned statistical expectations for the UC study. So we continue to be very positive about where that trial is heading, both in terms of the timelines as well as in terms of data integrity. Thank you. Yeah, so as Doug pointed out, as folks will do the math and the trial timing may look earlier than UC 52. The data are intended to be analyzed together. So the end of the study would expect the normal time period in terms of analysis, but it also important to remember that the last patient out is really dependent on whether patients enroll in the OLE or not. So we'll know more about exactly how tight the timing is between two studies as we get towards the end of the - end of patient exposure, and we get the last patient out on study. So stay tuned. We're excited about where we're at with this and really pleased that the teams were able to execute on UC 12 in the middle of a COVID pandemic. Thanks for your question. Yeah. Thanks for the question. The design of the CULTIVATE study starts with sub-study A. As you know that's a study that does not have a placebo control. It's just 2 and 3 milligrams. By expanding that study to 70 patients, we're able to get a pool of data set that's comparable to competitive products. We've done open label studies and moved directly on to registrational trials. So it really gives us the same size data set, and the robustness. And on top of that, we've got this collaboration on the biomarker side, which will help inform the overall program in time. The sub-study 1 was designed as a dose finding study between 2 and 3 milligrams in a placebo control setting. And at this point, should the sub-study A readout in line with our expectations, we would be in a position to power sub-study 1 to be the first to pivotal trial. So previously, we've contemplated sub-study 1 being a dose finding study and then moving to two large Phase III trials. In this case, we'd be able to power out the sub-study 1, if that makes sense. Yeah. And then the second question on the ER formulation, we continue to make good progress across the extended release. As you know, we've done some initial work on liquid formulation, so really try to pinpoint the exact curve we wanted to generate. And now what we're doing is we're looking across 2 and 3 milligrams and looking at broad range of potential formulations to begin to mimic that initial curve. So that work is ongoing and it's an iterative process. And we look at multiple different formulation methods, and there's a concentric circle between - concentric circles between being able to really identify the right formulation and developing new intellectual property. So as we've said before, the role of extended release is to both extend and expand the role of etrasimod, extend the intellectual property life and being able to expand into new indications. And so that work is ongoing and consistent with what we've said before. We hope to bridge that into the dermatology programs over time. Thank you. Sure. So we don't comment on details of any study's enrollment. We are spot on where we expect to be on that study. But with Doug's arrival and taking a look at the competitive set, evaluating our regulatory potential path forward, we've made this change so that we can begin to move the overall program faster forward, so that's really the objective here. No, we were working on this earlier and working through regulatory implications. As you know, working through regulatory implications isn't the fastest process in the world. So we were already working through this prior to Doug's arrival and Doug's judgment here is extremely important with his broad range of expertise, really gave us confidence that we were making the right decision here. Sure. So the safety is evaluated in a blinded fashion by external parties and the SMBs. And we haven't seen anything that would make us question our decision to go from 2 to 3 milligrams at this point. Thanks Jessica. Yeah, Hey, Chris, thanks. Yeah, there's no real difference in the additional 20 or so patients who will be adding to study from the original 50. As you know, working moderate to severe Crohn's. There's some very clear defined guidelines in terms of the patients we want in that study. And it's consistent with what everyone else has studied. I think this is the challenge in Crohn's broadly, which is, it's a narrow subset. Crohn's, as you know, has a lot of heterogeneity as Doug pointed out, and these studies are all designed to evaluate a very narrow subset of patients consistent with what other competitive products have seen. So Doug, Rob, anything to add to that? Yeah, so the data that we presented today is a relatively fulsome set. We'll continue to evaluate the open label data over time. We expect to present this data in an upcoming medical conference and we're working through that now. So this will get presented in a forum. But as I think you can see from the data just gives us additional confidence that the outcomes that we're seeing here, even with the elevated placebo rates we saw in first 12 week are actually quite robust and in line with other agents. So again, consistent with the safety profile of the etrasimod being a once a day oral, not having the liabilities of JAK inhibitors and being able to deliver efficacy that's in the range of the approved biologics. We're incredibly excited about where this is heading and we think there's a substantial market opportunity in front of us. Yeah, so it's not part of the Phase III plan. That's correct. Sure. Joe, so let me start and I'll then hand it off to Doug. The reason to do this is really the heterogeneity that Doug pointed out and to the extent we can begin to really understand the impact of etrasimod. We've talked extensively before about etrasimod's role beyond just migration of T-lymphocytes. We've talked about activity on tight junction protein [ph]; we've talked about activity on the innate immune system. And so we're really excited to see where these biomarkers come out. Doug you want to lend some more color on it? Sure. So let me answer that question by handing off to Rob to talk about the data we presented today and how it stacks up competitively. And why we're excited to anchor the Phase III program on to 2 milligram. Rob can you shed a little bit of color on what these numbers look like relative to the competitive set. Yeah, we'll continue to randomize 2 versus 3. Correct. Yeah, let me hand that off to Doug. Yeah. I'd just add one more thing, which is we're not discussing treatments against the microbiome; we're just looking at biomarkers in the microbiome as it relates to SNP modulation. And we think, to Doug's point, if we can create more homogeneity in the patient population that combined with the larger data set will allow us to be far more expeditious, and fiscally prudent in designing the remainder of the program. Sure, yeah. We won't get into the timelines on this, but Doug, if you want to take the first part of that question. Yeah. I think the most important striking finding that we had from the ADVICE double blind portion was that there was no plateau of effect. We made that point earlier in the year across and we've looked at as a patient by patient basis, we continue to see increase from eight weeks to 12 weeks, with no plateau of effect. So looking at 16 weeks was an important point for us. Recall that these patients were all washed out for four weeks before - we put back on 2 milligrams of etrasimod. So from that perspective it's cleaner ways, you can look at in open label study, to look at the effect size for etrasimod, and at 16 you can see - at 16 weeks you can see, again, a very robust response. Thanks to you. Appreciate it. Yeah, so yeah, we would stratify for 2 and 3 milligrams. The idea here is to give more alopecia areata patients as opposed to [indiscernible] patients, so we could address a broader subset. Recall also that we're treating for 24 weeks in this study, and we're talking about resident T-lymphocytes being cytotoxic at the hair follicle. So having sufficient time to be able to make an impact here has everything to do with being able to have that 24 week treatment period. So yes, we're looking at about 2 to 3 milligrams and expanding more to alopecia areata as opposed to [indiscernible] patients, so we'll get a broader subset of patients. And based on that, we think the expanded stuff here will allow us to make a more informed decision about how to move to Phase III. Thanks Joe. Yeah, we're blinded to the data. So we made this decision based on having a data set that would allow us to really think about sub-study as a pivotal study. That was the driver. We're, again, we're blinded to the data. So 52, we announced 70-30 split. This is trimming closer to what we saw an OASIS, which is about a 60-40 split. Yeah, Doug, do you want to just expand on that? So Laurie do you want to take that? Thanks Yatin. Sure. So let me - let's start with the commercialization question. Rob, do you want to take that please? I'm sorry. Can you repeat the first part of the question again? Yeah, so what we said in the Phase III program is, we have a substantial amount of moderate patients in the Phase II study, and we'll be looking for more of a contemporary split between moderate to severe atopic derm patients closer to 50-50. If you recall, we were thinking at 3%, moderate, at baseline, so we're looking for more moderate to severe patients, and so be a much more contemporary split in the modest of your population. Thank you. So for GLADIATOR that study is enrolling and we expect to have top line data to carry approval studies and we expect to have top line data shortly after approval, as Rob pointed out to really work with the payers on that with that data set to really drive greater payer access. So it's still ways down and the study is enrolling now. Yeah. So the Phase III program, its two milligrams we reserve the right to go back and look at 3 milligrams in a separate set of studies. But the 2 milligrams is what will go on the Phase III. And as you saw from the data that was presented, the 16 week data, the effect continues to increase, we're seeing a very safe product out to week 56. And we're seeing rates of EASI-75, IGA and the Peak Pruritis score that are in line with the market leader. So we're doing that with a once a day oral, so we feel very good about where that 2 milligram is coming out. And as you can imagine, we spent a lot of time with excellent advisors, staring at this open label data. And it's been very encouraging to hear from experts in the field about this data and how it validates 2 milligrams. As I pointed out on a previous question from the ADVICE portion, we saw that acceleration of effect from week eight to 12 and so continuing that lack of plateau really takes us out to 16. And, and so that delta feels very comfortable for us in terms of being able to think about Phase III program. Thank you. Yeah. Doug, do you want to take the first part of that, and I'll take the second part. Okay, and then the second part, looking past the UC studies, there's nothing rate limiting. We've been working for well over a year on making sure the clean form and quality systems necessary as well as the CMC are all in place toward the NDA. So there's nothing rate limiting beyond getting the studies completed. Great, thank you, everybody, for being on the call today. As you see, we continue to make significant progress across the portfolio Overall, we continue to evaluate market competitive and regulatory environments and as necessary adapter approaches to shorten the overall timelines for programs and get really our science the best chance of providing a clinical signal that's really important to us. And we think the changes we continue to make on these studies are all designed to really accelerate the overall programs. We're excited about anchoring on 2 milligrams for atopic derm, given the 16 week data we presented today. And I'd like to just conclude again by thanking the Arena team for their incredible hard work and dedication across the portfolio. But specifically call out the ELEVATE team at Arena for being able to really in the face of a lot of external and noise around the pandemic being able to execute these studies in a way that's ahead of schedule as well as maintaining strict data integrity. So thank you again, for everyone jumping on the call, and look forward to continued conversations."

Turning to Slide 9 for key financial measures, research and development expenses for the second quarter totaled $112.5 million, compared to $64.9 million in the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily driven by advancement of our clinical trial programs, as well as an increase in personnel expenses as we staffed to support our program growth. Selling general and administrative expenses for the second quarter totaled $31.9 million, compared to $22.9 million in the same period in 2020. Net loss for the second quarter was $146.1 million, compared to a net loss of $84.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the second quarter was $2.40 compared to basic and diluted net loss per share of $1.61 for the same period in 2020. Operating cash burn in the second quarter was $93.8 million, compared to $77.8 million in the same period in the prior year. And as of June 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately $1.0 billion, compared to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2021. And now I'll turn the call back over to Amit who will make some concluding remarks before opening the call to the Q&A session. Yeah, certainly, we haven't given guidance for '21 or '22 yet on cash burn. But what I can tell you is we did have a $214 million cash burn in the first half of '21. And then obviously, we have increasing patient enrollment in all of our studies and advancement in all of our studies, so we would expect somewhat."

Even excluding the revenue provided from our COVID-19 vaccine, our revenues grew 8% operationally, 10% reported, and this 8% growth includes a negative 5% impact from pricing. We continued to accelerate production and shipments to our COVID-19 vaccine, in many cases, exceeding our contractual obligations for delivery timelines. And we achieved several important clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones.  Let me start with commentary on some of our biggest growth drivers in this quarter. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contributed $3.5 billion in global revenues during the first quarter. As of May 3, 2021, Pfizer, along with its partner, BioNTech has shipped approximately 430 million doses of the vaccine to 91 countries and territories around the world. I will share some thoughts on the sustainability of this revenue stream later in my remarks.  Eliquis has continued to deliver a strong performance with revenues up 25% operationally to $1.6 billion in the first quarter. In the U.S., Eliquis sales growth was driven mainly by strong volume growth. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX generated revenues of $453 million, representing operational growth of 88%. Our disease education efforts in the U.S. continue to support appropriate diagnosis, increasing the estimated diagnosis rate to almost 24% at quarter end, up from 21% at the end of 2020. \nFrank D'Amelio: Thank you, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. Clearly, the COVID-19 vaccine has had a dramatic positive impact on our year-over-year results, and Albert has addressed the key points on the COVID-19 vaccine landscape.  Looking at the income statement. Revenue and adjusted cost of sales was significantly impacted by COVID-19 vaccine sales and the associated 50% gross profit split with BioNTech, which we recognize on the cost of sales line. Revenue increased 42% operationally in the first quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and solid performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced gross margin by 10 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2020, which primarily reflects the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine gross profit split, which accounted for approximately 8 percentage points and, to a much smaller extent, product mix.  Looking at the business excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, we saw a continuation of solid revenue growth for the business in the quarter, which nicely supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% through the end of 2025. As a reminder, this growth projection continues to exclude any contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine.  In addition, compared with the prior year quarter, first quarter 2021 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $400 million as a result of the first quarter 2021 having 3 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in international markets. This increase in selling days will be offset in fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in essentially the same number of selling days in full year '21 as compared to full year 2020.  However, the favorable impact on quarter-over-quarter comparisons in first quarter 2021 from selling days partially offset by the nonreoccurrence of favorable revenue impacts related to COVID-19 in first quarter 2020, including increased demand for certain products of approximately $150 million and additional wholesaler inventories of approximately $100 million. Given these factors, the net favorable impact on first quarter 2021 revenues is approximately $150 million or approximately 1.5 percentage points of operational growth, which in effect reduces a strong 8% operational growth rate to about 7%.  Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was up 44% compared to the year-ago quarter, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 47% for the quarter. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 3% positive benefit to revenue and a 1% benefit to adjusted diluted EPS.  Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance. We've again provided total company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine, and then we provided some additional sub-ledger detail on our assumptions regarding the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution, so you can also see our projection for the business without the COVID-19 vaccine.  To start, the adjustments we've made to our total company guidance are almost entirely due to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 vaccine and R&D spending on incremental COVID-19 programs and non-COVID-19 mRNA programs, along with a small increase in the revenue outlook for the business excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. For adjusted cost of sales, the ranges have increased to 38% to 39%, which incorporates the incremental anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which has a significantly higher cost of sales due to the gross margin split with BioNTech as compared to the rest of the business. The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total company revenue has increased to 36% as compared to 25% in our initial 2021 guidance.  On adjusted SI&A, we have maintained our initial guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion. In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion to incorporate anticipated spending on incremental COVID-19-related programs and other mRNA-based projects that are not part of the BioNTech partnership. Working this through with a projected 15% effective tax rate yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.55 to $3.65 or 59% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.  Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. As referenced earlier, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50-50 gross margin split. Pfizer will book the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, where we receive a profit share from BioNTech and we do not participate in China. We now expect that we can manufacture up to 2.5 billion doses in '21, subject to continuous process improvements, expansion at current facilities and adding new suppliers and contract manufacturers.  As of mid-April, we have contracted for approximately 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered in 2021 and still have contracts for potential additional doses under review. Based on the approximately 1.6 billion doses, we are now forecasting approximately $26 billion in COVID-19 vaccine revenue this year. We continue to have 3 pricing tiers for government contracts depending on the relative wealth of nations.  Our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue continues to include manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expense as well as a payment to BioNTech representing the 50% gross profit split. We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue. This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs. As I noted earlier, the COVID-19 vaccine is now projected to account for 36% of total revenue for 2021, up from 25% in our initial guidance for the year.  Let me add that if we contract for additional delivery of doses during the year, we will provide a guidance update in our subsequent earning releases. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly increased 2021 revenue range to be between $44.6 billion and $46.6 billion, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint.  In terms of adjusted diluted EPS, we continue to project a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents approximately 11% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent with how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation.  You likely saw our announcement that we have maintained our dividend payment for the second quarter at its current level despite Viatris announcing their expected dividend payment. For those continuing to own Viatris shares, this effectively represents an increase in the dividend income, and our Board felt that the strength of our business supported maintaining our dividend. For the foreseeable future, we expect our Board to continue to support annual dividend increases at approximately this year's level. Obviously, we have no say as to what Viatris does with its future dividend.  In summary, a tremendous start to 2021. The COVID-19 vaccine continues to benefit millions of people around the world, and the business is on track for anticipated solid top and bottom line growth. We remain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting in-market brands and looking to deploy capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can solidify our long-term revenue and earnings growth outlook. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.\nCharles Triano: Great. Thanks, Frank and Albert, for your prepared remarks. At this point, operator, let's move to our Q&A session, please.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Congratulations on the quarter. So first question I had for you. What are your thoughts on the slowing vaccination rates in the U.S.? Do you anticipate things to pick up again? And will we reach that level of herd immunity in the U.S. here? And then second question I had was on vaccine sales and how you think about it beyond 2021 and 2022. What gives you confidence that there's going to be a tail here? And how does that tail look relative to the $26 billion that you're going to potentially have this year? And then last question I had for you is just on how you're thinking about FDA concerns around JAK safety.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Louise. Let me make some comments on the slowing vaccinations and maybe a little bit on the '22/'23 revenues. I will ask Mikael Dolsten to add some comments over there. And then for also JAK, I will ask him to make some comments about the same. Look, I think the U.S. has done a tremendously good job and they have reached vaccination level that we didn't think that they will. The truth is that as we are vaccinating more and more people, the people that are reluctant to get a vaccine are enriching the remaining pool. So it's normal to expect that we will see a drop in the vaccination.  But I believe that the entering of additional pools like younger people, post the expected approval of our 11 to 15 years old. Vaccination also will provide an additional increase in the vaccination rates. All in all, I think U.S. is doing a very good job and their focus of all should be to convince those people that they have still fear about the vaccine, that they must do the right thing.  Now beyond '22 and '23, first of all, we believe, as we said multiple times, that there will be a need for boosters. And there is a need likely from now all the way to  and then believe that the likely annual vaccinations or, let's say, regular vaccinations would be required. Clearly, this belief is based on the totality of the evidence and not on studies that they have read out right now to convince that this is the case.  And the totality of the evidence are having to do with the fact that we still have very high efficacy of 90 -- above 90% in our 6 months but it is slower at 91% then 95% that we had in the beginning. So there are some indications that there is a drop in the efficacy over time. We now have been  studies of neutralizing antibodies that also is a drop on these antibodies, and that affects not only people that they are vaccinated but also naturally infected.  We also know that after 6 months, the increase of reinfections to people that they had previous infections is increasing. And we also know that we are, right now, our vaccine at least effective against all the variants that we have seen but there is a drop in neutralizing titers, so which means that  to maintain good efficacy against the variants, you need to increase the immunogenicity and this is why we are doing the with the boosters.  So the totality of the events are pointing out to this. And this is the reason why basically all governments of the world are now discussing with us about procurement agreements for '22, '23 and '24. But I will ask also Mikael Dolsten to make some comments on why we think that the boosters and repeating vaccinations is a likely scenario and also a comment on the JAK sale. Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you, Albert. I thought you outlined, in an excellent manner, that we have identified a handful of key points related to immunity was induced by convalescent after injection of vaccine that will, over time, as expected, show some decline. Antibodies will show some decline as their half-life are limited. Of course, protection contains other immune mechanism.  When you put all of this in context that SARS-CoV-2 is globally circulating to extent we have rarely seen or ever seen in our lifetime of a virus, and the inability to control across the globe will, of course, lead to numerous changes in the viral mutation rate. So it just punctuates what Albert said, we need continuously to keep up a very high immune pressure against the virus to stay ahead of the curve. And the best way to do that is with regular boosting.  And finally, herd immunity, while we would like to see it established, what you hear from a lot of public health and global health state emerging is that it will be really difficult on enlarged continent to establish such a high immunization rate across all ages and to ensure as you immunize one part of the continent that immunity is maintained at another part. So I think we would really need to rely on regular immunization and, of course, other public health measures rather than hoping that herd immunity across the globe can be established.  Finally, on the JAK safety, already in February 21, FDA made it public about our data in 11.33 related to increased risk of serious heart-related problems and certain cancer when compared to another type of medicines, the TNF inhibitors. So these data are clearly not new. FDA, EMA and other agencies work in dialogue with us to finalize the outcome of this review. On the other hand, I think the JAK class has shown to be an important contribution as an oral alternative for many patients, and you avoid other issues such as drug antibodies with the biologicals.  So we continue to wait for finalization of the outcome of the 11.33 trial. We think each JAK inhibitor is unique and needs to be assessed by itself. And we continue to believe that with proper labeling and given the tremendous experience of Xeljanz since 2012, it will continue to have a potential to be an important medicine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Thank you for all the work on the vaccine front. I just had a follow-up on the booster question. Do you think that will be uniform across different groups? Or will there be any differences by baseline characteristics such as age in terms of the timing or a need for a boost? And then would you expect FDA and CDC to issue a recommendation on the need for boosters sometime this year?  And then my second question for Albert or Frank is just would welcome your perspective on the potential impact of tax rate changes in the U.S. And any thoughts on how that might change your capital allocation strategy and/or views on inversions.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael, why don't you take the question for the boosters?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. I think we cannot, of course, predict what CDC and similar agencies will do. But what seems to be the general public dialogue and which, of course, builds on experience with other viral epidemics, and this is, of course, a pandemic, is that you would likely start with those that are most susceptible, older adults, those with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, obesity, COPD, asthma, many that are immune-impaired. And of course, that constitutes a very large population.  While you may start with those, if we are to really maintain control of the virus, it will be very reasonable to assume the importance of also vaccinating younger groups. Although severe COVID is less common in younger groups, some patients may suffer severely from such infection, and they are at risk also of acquiring Long COVID syndrome, which can caused significant impairment of participation in functional life for young individuals as well as old. So all in all, yes, regular boost of entire population is a clear possibility priorities to start, of course, with many vulnerable from age to chronic diseases, which is a large number of adult population.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And Frank, would you like to take the question about the tax?\nFrank D'Amelio: Sure. Thank you, Albert. So I think it's premature to comment on what impact the proposed tax reform would have in our -- how we view capital allocation and inversion simply because these kinds of proposals typically go through multiple iterations, multiple discussions, multiple negotiations. Obviously, we're staying very close to this, doing all the analytics that you would expect us to do.  But I think what's really important is how we think about taxes and tax policy. 2017 tax reform leveled the playing field for U.S. multinationals against foreign competitors. And that was an enabler, from my perspective, of much of what we've done with capital deployment, particularly in the U.S. We committed to $5 billion of CapEx investment between 2018 and 2022. We committed a few billion of that risk capital in order to develop the COVID vaccine. Funding of our U.S. qualified pension plan that we did last year to the tune of over $1 billion.  All of those, from my perspective, were enabled by the level-playing field that we now get to compete on against our foreign competitors. And so what we want from tax reform, when all is said and done, is we want that level-playing field to continue so that we have the ability to compete on a level-playing field. So that's my answer, Albert.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Congratulations on a remarkable quarter and really tremendous progress. Some quick questions. First on pricing, you mentioned the 5% headwind. Could you give us a sense of what that looks like for the rest of the year? Is that something that we should be expecting for the full year or is it just a Q1 phenomenon? And then related to that, Albert, you disclosed your view on the pricing policy and regulatory and legislative update. But is what you described a realistic case or is that the best case?  And then a couple of questions for Mikael. Mikael, I've asked you this before, but given what we're seeing in India and in other geographies, is it your view that COVID is going to be a case of convergent evolution or continuous evolution, i.e., are we seeing new mutations beyond E4 and E484K have additional resistance mechanisms to the first generation of vaccines and antibodies? And then just lastly, you mentioned mRNA. You have a maternal RSV vaccine. Are you planning to apply mRNA as a more efficient approach to getting the and infant coverage against mRNA -- against, RSV, sorry.\nAlbert Bourla: Geoff, a lot of questions, very important. Now let me speak a little bit about the policy of the prices, and then I will ask Frank to comment a little bit on the pricing. And the needs to add something, please feel free. And then on the 2 other areas, clearly, Mikael will speak about the resistance and the mRNA.  On the pricing reforms, these are our standard positions. But I will try to explain how I feel about the pricing reforms. And I have said it in multiple occasions. We don't think that status quo is good for anyone. I don't think it's good for the industry. I don't think it's good for the Americans because there is a problem with the current way of the current system. And this is a problem that basically every American is paying for their medicines, and this is unique to medicines, not to other medical interventions, is paying out of the pocket like if they don't have insurance, although they do have insurance.  And this is the fundamental thing that needs to change. Because the medicines contribution to the overall health care, it is 12%. So by definition, cannot be the big issue but it is becoming the big issue in the discussion because everybody has to pay this thing from out-of-pocket almost, unlike other intervention. So what this change could look like? And for us, a change could look -- take different forms. It could be consistent from different areas, may not be the rebate reform, which I think is one of the systemic issues that we are having with drug pricing, but it could be that out-of-pocket caps.  The fundamental thing it is that there will be a cost that the industry, I'm sure, will be willing to take our first  as long as all the savings, all the contributions that we are doing right now from this industry will go to the pockets of the American patients. And this is a fundamental difference with people that we're discussing right now because we are hearing a lot of suggestions that they want to tax the pharmaceutical companies or tax the insurance companies, but the proceeds will just fall in the black hole of the federal budget, which is not what we want.  If our contributions go to the patients, we are sitting down with all the parties trying to do a decent price reform in the way that the Americans are experiencing the cost when they go to their pharmacy to collect their medicines. So is it realistic or optimistic? I believe it is realistic. I believe that there is room for agreement both with the 2 sides of the aisle and with this administration. And we will continue working on finding this solution. But I repeat, make medicines affordable for the patients and not throw money to the black hole of the federal budget. Now Frank, if you can take the price increase and then Mikael.\nFrank D'Amelio: Okay. So you've heard Albert and me talk about pricing and that pricing has been a headwind, and we expect it to continue to be a headwind for the foreseeable future. And that's obviously what we saw this quarter, with pricing being a negative 5% on a global basis. I should also mention it was negative 5% in the U.S.  Now in terms of our guidance, which is what you asked, Geoffrey, our guidance assumed the pricing decrease, negative impact, I'll call it in the range of low to mid-single digits. So that 5% reduction that we saw this quarter is consistent with what we assumed in our annual guidance.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Frank. And by the way, I wanted to add that this minus 5% that it is the reality of the numbers. I'm sure that many Americans haven't experienced, during this quarter, a 5% reduction in their out of pocket because it's a system that works in a way that no matter what you do on the top, their price that they have to pay is derived from very different rules. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the resistant mechanism in the mRNA or RSV?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, thank you. I'll start with mRNA. As you discussed here, Geoffrey, of course, there is tremendous viral amounts across the globe fueled by the spread in large population areas like India. We do see several different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 established. They, however, seem to share the most critical mutations. Most of the variants have up to 10 mutations and they can combine on different ways.  So far, we believe that our B2, the current vaccine is very effective in controlling all known mutations. But as Albert alluded to, we believe it's very important to keep up very high neutralizing antibody levels in addition to the nice T cell immunity. And that's why a possible outcome of this tremendous spread, including India, is to have a regular boost.  As the pandemic continues, up to now, mutations have been selected mainly because the virus is trying to spread more quickly. The virus will now face vaccinated immunity in maybe '22, '23 increasingly. So we need to be prepared that there could be new unexpected mutations to come. And that's why Pfizer is leaving no stone untouched and also have variant vaccine developed and could be an alternative later if that scenario would emerge. But right now, it seems like the current vaccine is very effective against all these variants despite each having up to 10 different mutations.  On the RSV, well, we had very robust titers with our protein-based RSV vaccine in maternal vaccination, very good tolerability and antibodies passed efficiently through the cord blood. And we are enrolling now well in Phase III. We also have initiated a Phase II CHALLENGE study with RSV that will read out mid of the year, and that could possibly lead to progression swiftly into Phase III. So we are pretty advanced with the protein base, it looks very good. But of course, we have now an mRNA platform that we would like to use for multiple opportunities. We expect to put into the clinic, 2, first in humans, novel vaccines every year for the next 2 years. Certainly, RSV could, in the future, be 1 alternative, whether it could be a supplement to the protein base in order to add some T cell immunity. These are things we'll continue to explore and then prioritize among the many exciting opportunities for our mRNA platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nStephen Scala: I have two questions. Regarding the DMD gene therapy, is the potency assay issue related to concerns around correlation of biomarkers to motor function efficacy? Or is it simply a technical issue with no bearing on relevance of the end points?  And second question is a little bit more broad-based. But in the COVID vaccine, Pfizer has built the world's largest global pharmaceutical franchise in 6 months. I imagine that it is creating a substantial stress throughout the organization, similar to the disruption of a major acquisition. What metrics do you monitor to ensure that these stresses are not going to show up in 1 to 3 years or so as, say, subpar product performances, clinical trial failures that otherwise would have been successes and maybe missed M&A that would have otherwise made sense for Pfizer?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Steve. Mikael, would you like to take the DMD question? Is it a technical issue .\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. So the DMD trial, first of all, and I think Albert mentioned that in his introductory remark, is enrolling in many different countries. And in each of those, we had a matrix of assays that were cleared and -- by the regulatory authorities. The particular discussion with FDA is more of a technical issue on how to do a quantification in 1 supportive assay but not really as per our view in any of the main assays.  So we continue to work with them and aim to resolve it. I want to point out that to the best of my knowledge, we were first to start DMD Phase III, now enrolling well outside the U.S. late last year. And we are probably -- by now we're entering May, 6 months ahead of anyone using yield therapy as it as least public, it hasn't been disclosed any other having been cleared with FDA.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, yes. Thank you, Mikael. And Steve, it's true that in order to achieve what was achieved during the -- with this vaccine, the ingenuity of our people was a key component but also a lot of personal sacrifice had to be involved. So a lot of the people who worked day and night, a lot of these people, worked days and nights to make sure that this happens. And that clearly, it is taking a toll on them. And no matter how proud they feel because the passion that they have can keep them going forever, I am concerned that we need to find ways so that these people will not break them out.  But I need also to emphasize that Pfizer is run in the form of business units. Since 2016, when I was running the business that basically underlies running right now and to have organized the whole operations into 6 business units. And that involved the R&D, the commercial and the clinical development. So the work for COVID happened in 1 of the 6 business units and happened predominantly in the R&D domain of these clinical units. But at the same time, the oncology business unit and the disease business unit and the internal medicine business unit and all the other business units that we are having kept working on their normal, let's say, workload, let me put it that way.  They of course, also to overcome issues related with the COVID-19 that didn't make the work very easy. But again, they were being able to rise to the occasion because I believe everybody in Pfizer right now is so strong believer of a that patients come first. And this is not about that. So this sense of sacrifice that we see in the vaccines, we have seen it also in the other units. People are very passionate about what they do and they feel very proud.  So I'm giving the answer to say that there is a very intense, let's say, disruption that happened in part of the organization, not in the entire organization and -- but has been offset by an incredible sense of pride that those people are taking because of what has been achieved. So I can't control them in terms of how hard they are working right now on all the other vaccines, for example.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: Great. And said, thanks so much for all the efforts around COVID. So a couple of questions that I have. So one, I guess there's obviously some debate around the durability of your vaccine sales and cash flows. But you clearly have a lot more sales and a lot more free cash now to than you've probably envisioned a couple of years ago because of the vaccine. So I'm just thinking that you are obviously investing more behind the COVID vaccine and therapeutics. But can you just talk about your priorities from a capital allocation perspective? Now I don't think you mentioned you don't want to do share repurchases. But is there other priorities that you could maybe look to, whether it's bringing in external assets or maybe even doing larger deals, given the extra cash that you now will have?  And then maybe a second one, I guess, for Albert, maybe a little bit more of a personal angle here. But I appreciate your comments you made around the COVID crisis in India recently. I'm just wondering if you can provide some clarity on the status of getting your vaccine to the market there. I think you filed back in February and then there's some questions about maybe doing a trial in India, I think some questions around indemnification, around side effects. Can you just clarify where things stand there and what might be reasonable in terms of timing to get the vaccine available to patients there?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you very much. In terms of -- let me start with that. In terms of the vaccine in India, we applied months ago, as you know. And in -- we have -- and we applied exactly the same file that we gave to the entire world, the FDA, EMA, Japan, everybody in the world. India wanted to do additional studies in order to approve this vaccine over there, which clearly, we were not ready to allocate resources and something like that, whether when we were allocating all the resources to do things into the variants, the kids, pregnant women and I can go on things that who haven't done it before.  But the Indian governments are really very good in having discussions right now with us about all these issues that you have raised. So we are hopeful that they would change this policy about conducting some local trials, and we will find a path forward so that we can provide the vaccines. That being said, the key thing right now today in the next 1 or 2 months, it is that people are dying in hospitals in India, and vaccine will not change that in the next 1 or 2 months. I think that will be a reality that we have to live with right now.  And what is more important is to make sure that the Indian government has enough medicines to treat the people but they are going to be hospitals right now. And this is why I guess we announced that for 4 of our medicines, that they are in their governmental protocol because the authorities have developed a protocol of treating COVID patients. And there are 4 of our medicines involved in these protocols. We will provide enough of these medicines for every patient in every public hospital in the next 30 days.  And as we speak, we are ramping up production of these medicines in Europe, in the U.S., in Asia. And we are ramping up distribution channels so that we can ship, as quickly as possible, those medicines to India because the need is immediate.  Now on the capital allocation, I will ask also Frank to make some comments here, but very few things are changing because of that. Our strategy on capital allocation was not driven with how much capital we have, was driven with how much opportunity we have. So we never say never to anything. So we maintain the eye to see be flexible. But clearly, Frank spoke about it, a growing dividend, it is a part of our investment thesis so that will be maintained. And also, we said that our investment in research, our investment in manufacturing, our investments of our capital are all aiming to improve the longevity, how durable it is our growth in the second part of the decade.  So you should expect to see a lot of Phase II, Phase III business development deals that will allow us to bring in-house a lot of potential medicines that could become medicines in this time frame. Frank, anything to add?\nFrank D'Amelio: Yes, Vamil, you're absolutely right. Obviously, the COVID business is generating incremental free cash flow for us, but from my perspective, not material enough to have any major impact on our capital structure. And to Albert's point, the term I would use is we will stay the course in terms of how we deploy our capital. And then Albert obviously potential areas where we would deploy it, right? The dividend, investing in the business and you saw that with the R&D guidance increase this quarter and then M&A and M&A really focused on growth in the second half of the decade.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Frank, there was a comment you made back in March which got a lot of attention. And I thought perhaps you could elaborate a bit more on how you're thinking about the durability of COVID revenues and perhaps lay out the sort of the volume and the price element of it beyond 2022. And if you could also perhaps speak to the pricing seen in your Canadian contracts, whether it's consistent in 2023, '24 versus where it was in the '21 contract.  And then I had a quick R&D 1 as well, if I may. I know there's these additional FDA technical requests on the gene therapy assay for DMD. I recall you guys were using ITR in Phase I and then you switched to a transgene assay in Phase III because it was a little more low variability. Is FDA now thinking the variability is higher than they want in the transgene assay as well? I'm just trying to understand what the word \"matrix\" means. Is it still just the transgene assay with different methods or are there multiple assays at play now?\nAlbert Bourla: Frank?\nFrank D'Amelio: Thank you, Albert. So on pricing, Umer, I really want to not get into detail on pricing other than obviously, there are certain contracts where we disclosed with the prices. In terms of the way I think about this, what we're really focused on now is getting doses to the patients that need doses around the world so getting people vaccinated. That's been our focus. That's -- we're acutely focused on that.  You heard in our prepared remarks, we said we can make approximately 2.5 billion doses this year. We can take that up to 3 billion doses next year. And that's what we're really focused on, right, getting those made, getting them delivered and getting vaccines into patients' arms. So that's the focus.  On the Canada contract, we didn't discuss pricing on that contract. What we did say was up to 125 million doses in 2022 and 2023, with an option for more doses in 2024. And then in terms of the durability of the franchise, I'm going to try not to repeat what Albert said, but I thought Albert went into a lot of detail on why we believe the COVID revenue franchise has significant durability and why we think we see that as something that's going to take place for the foreseeable future. And Albert went through a lot of the details how we believe that is.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Frank. Mikael, about the technical question?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. The core assays that you alluded to related to AAV and transient effectiveness are all without any real comments by FDA so they're all fine. This is what I call a supportive assay, an adjunct assay that was more related to colocalization of the DMD protein and discussions on various technologies how to measure that. And as I said, in Europe, as this was an adjunct assay in other countries, we have cleared and enrolled efficiently and progressing towards the next step of the trial very well.  So it's a very technical issue how to do a detection but not related to the core potency assays. And obviously, we're working to resolve it. But what I understand currently, there is no other potential gene therapy in U.S. that have cleared yet to Phase III. And we obviously would like to be first, no just ex U.S. where we've been going for 6 months but within U.S. and work diligently to resolve this very technical question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTimothy Anderson: A couple of questions, please. On mRNA and your flu vaccine plans, how would a trial be constructed and really, what's the goal? Are you looking to show superiority on efficacy or just hoping to achieve parity with existing vaccines? And you talked about yours being quadrivalent, so presumably, if there is a comparator, that would be something like Sanofi's flu block. Also, what would be the likely development time line? I'm guessing it's not as fast as the COVID vaccine. It would take something longer, maybe a couple of years.  And then a separate question on your 5-year guidance. Just what -- just to make sure I understand your earlier comments on pricing. What does your 5-year guidance assume about drug pricing, especially in the context of there possibly being European drug pricing austerity measures due to COVID?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you, Tim. And Mikael, do you want to take the question about the flu?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. With the flu vaccine, given the strong immune response we have seen for our mRNA platform, we certainly hope to be able to show substantial differentiation versus current flu vaccine. This is, of course, the aspiration we have. Technically, there will be 2 components: one is to look at immune response on antibodies that have certain standards reported related to increase in titer. And we will be able to compare to the current protein-based flu vaccines. And then we're also planning to run a vaccine efficacy study, where we think it's not just what we hope to be a very potent antibody response but also the T cell response.  So I would certainly aspire to that we would have a vaccine that is to be substantially meaningful better than the current vaccine based on the platform by itself but also based on that we are able, so fast, to align the platform with the sequence of the emerging flu strains, while as you may know, many years, the protein base are misaligned, and that's why you get very modest vaccine efficacy on maybe just 50% and similar for immune responses. So given that we saw 95% efficacy against COVID, we think there is a large module for us to improve on the current flu vaccine.  On the timing, Albert said we are moving to start human trials in Q3. And we will obviously, early on, generate data on the immunogenicity. And if that continued to go as well as our aspiration, we think we can move very fast with this vaccine and also utilizing the type of approach where you establish a large number of sites in the regions to study in order to enroll very fast. And we will look at various ways to register this vaccine and also how that could coincide with the recommendation by  So while we don't give at this early time an exact date but it anticipated we will move very fast, may not be as fast as a pandemic development but much faster than the traditional flu development.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And then, Frank, I know you did answer the pricing, but do you want to say a little bit more about it?\nFrank D'Amelio: Sure, Albert. And this was more about the 5-year CAGR through 2025.\nAlbert Bourla: Correct.\nFrank D'Amelio: So I think, Tim, the way I think about it is we really look at pricing by geographic region. And we consider -- we continue to believe it's going to be a headwind by geographic region. What would be examples of that? The U.S. would be one, emerging markets would be one. Developed Europe would be one, just as an example. They all range in, I'll call it, negative pricing increases and the range is low single digits to high single digits. And obviously, we blend that all together into an overall global rate, and that's what we've assumed in our CAGR assumptions through 2025.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob: Just a couple on the mRNA vaccines that you're pushing forward. You had been working with BioNTech for your flu vaccine. I just want to confirm that you're using the Pfizer mRNA technology for the flu vaccine that you're moving forward with. And curious as to why you're going with that approach beyond just the economic benefit of using your own tech versus something that you're collaborating with on. Is there something different about your mRNA technology, whether it's in the non-COVID portions of the vaccine or the LMP?  And then secondly, again on the flu vaccine, what is your ability to formulate it with the COVID vaccine? I'm wondering why you're moving forward at a co-formulated Prevnar 20 plus 162b2 and not looking for the flu vaccine co-formulation.\nAlbert Bourla: As regards to flu vaccine, we had a elaboration with BioNTech that goes back to 2018. At the time, we had announced also publicly some of the terms of this agreement. And the developments are based on the work that has been done so far by both companies on the flu.  As regard to the question of co-formulated, we didn't announce a co-formulation with Prevnar right now. We announced co-administration with Prevnar. Clearly, we are looking at options to co-formulate the BioNTech-Pfizer mRNA vaccine against COVID with other, let's say, vaccines. But this is not what we spoke about today and we haven't made final decisions on co-formulate. And I think Chuck, we do not have time for another question, right?\nCharles Triano: That's right, Albert. Just your closing remarks.\nAlbert Bourla: Okay. I wanted to thank everyone for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer. I do think the pandemic has been the ultimate test for Pfizer's and, in truth, the entire pharmaceutical industry's capabilities and credibility. And in my view, we have, thus far, passed with flying colors.  The success of our COVID-19 vaccine has led to an important question. If we could do this for COVID-19, why not for other diseases? There are so many people suffering from other serious diseases and their needs aren't any less urgent. We now see an opportunity to take the lessons learned and new ways of thinking and apply them across our entire portfolio.  The speed with which we interact with regulators as well as the continued acceleration of digital solutions such as artificial intelligence, electronic diaries, advanced analytics and electronic health records are just some of the things we plan to bring to all of our clinical trials so we can continue to move at the speed of science.  And now before we end the call, I want to take a moment to extend my thanks and very best wishes to our colleague and good friend of mine, Chuck Triano, who will be retiring at the end of September. Chuck has been interacting with the global investment community for nearly 35 years, including the past 13 years here at Pfizer. And I think all of you would agree that during the time, he has elevated Pfizer's investor relations function to a best-in-class. That's because he values clarity, integrity and transparency in the way you communicate. And it is because he has a passion for our company and our industry that makes him an outstanding champion for both.  The good news is he will be around for at least 1 more earnings cycle and perhaps another as he has agreed to stay on us as advisor during this transition. Chuck, thank you for being a valued colleague and friend. Pfizer will miss you, but on behalf of all of us, I wish you all the best in the next part of your journey. Thank you, everyone, and have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chuck, and hello, everyone. I couldn't be prouder of the way Pfizer has started 2021. During the first quarter, we delivered strong financial results. Even excluding the revenue provided from our COVID-19 vaccine, our revenues grew 8% operationally, 10% reported, and this 8% growth includes a negative 5% impact from pricing. We continued to accelerate production and shipments to our COVID-19 vaccine, in many cases, exceeding our contractual obligations for delivery timelines. And we achieved several important clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones.  Let me start with commentary on some of our biggest growth drivers in this quarter. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine contributed $3.5 billion in global revenues during the first quarter. As of May 3, 2021, Pfizer, along with its partner, BioNTech has shipped approximately 430 million doses of the vaccine to 91 countries and territories around the world. I will share some thoughts on the sustainability of this revenue stream later in my remarks.  Eliquis has continued to deliver a strong performance with revenues up 25% operationally to $1.6 billion in the first quarter. In the U.S., Eliquis sales growth was driven mainly by strong volume growth. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX generated revenues of $453 million, representing operational growth of 88%. Our disease education efforts in the U.S. continue to support appropriate diagnosis, increasing the estimated diagnosis rate to almost 24% at quarter end, up from 21% at the end of 2020. Thank you very much, Louise. Let me make some comments on the slowing vaccinations and maybe a little bit on the '22/'23 revenues. I will ask Mikael Dolsten to add some comments over there. And then for also JAK, I will ask him to make some comments about the same. Look, I think the U.S. has done a tremendously good job and they have reached vaccination level that we didn't think that they will. The truth is that as we are vaccinating more and more people, the people that are reluctant to get a vaccine are enriching the remaining pool. So it's normal to expect that we will see a drop in the vaccination.  But I believe that the entering of additional pools like younger people, post the expected approval of our 11 to 15 years old. Vaccination also will provide an additional increase in the vaccination rates. All in all, I think U.S. is doing a very good job and their focus of all should be to convince those people that they have still fear about the vaccine, that they must do the right thing.  Now beyond '22 and '23, first of all, we believe, as we said multiple times, that there will be a need for boosters. And there is a need likely from now all the way to  and then believe that the likely annual vaccinations or, let's say, regular vaccinations would be required. Clearly, this belief is based on the totality of the evidence and not on studies that they have read out right now to convince that this is the case.  And the totality of the evidence are having to do with the fact that we still have very high efficacy of 90 -- above 90% in our 6 months but it is slower at 91% then 95% that we had in the beginning. So there are some indications that there is a drop in the efficacy over time. We now have been  studies of neutralizing antibodies that also is a drop on these antibodies, and that affects not only people that they are vaccinated but also naturally infected.  We also know that after 6 months, the increase of reinfections to people that they had previous infections is increasing. And we also know that we are, right now, our vaccine at least effective against all the variants that we have seen but there is a drop in neutralizing titers, so which means that  to maintain good efficacy against the variants, you need to increase the immunogenicity and this is why we are doing the with the boosters.  So the totality of the events are pointing out to this. And this is the reason why basically all governments of the world are now discussing with us about procurement agreements for '22, '23 and '24. But I will ask also Mikael Dolsten to make some comments on why we think that the boosters and repeating vaccinations is a likely scenario and also a comment on the JAK sale. Mikael? Mikael, why don't you take the question for the boosters? Thank you, Mikael. And Frank, would you like to take the question about the tax? Geoff, a lot of questions, very important. Now let me speak a little bit about the policy of the prices, and then I will ask Frank to comment a little bit on the pricing. And the needs to add something, please feel free. And then on the 2 other areas, clearly, Mikael will speak about the resistance and the mRNA.  On the pricing reforms, these are our standard positions. But I will try to explain how I feel about the pricing reforms. And I have said it in multiple occasions. We don't think that status quo is good for anyone. I don't think it's good for the industry. I don't think it's good for the Americans because there is a problem with the current way of the current system. And this is a problem that basically every American is paying for their medicines, and this is unique to medicines, not to other medical interventions, is paying out of the pocket like if they don't have insurance, although they do have insurance.  And this is the fundamental thing that needs to change. Because the medicines contribution to the overall health care, it is 12%. So by definition, cannot be the big issue but it is becoming the big issue in the discussion because everybody has to pay this thing from out-of-pocket almost, unlike other intervention. So what this change could look like? And for us, a change could look -- take different forms. It could be consistent from different areas, may not be the rebate reform, which I think is one of the systemic issues that we are having with drug pricing, but it could be that out-of-pocket caps.  The fundamental thing it is that there will be a cost that the industry, I'm sure, will be willing to take our first  as long as all the savings, all the contributions that we are doing right now from this industry will go to the pockets of the American patients. And this is a fundamental difference with people that we're discussing right now because we are hearing a lot of suggestions that they want to tax the pharmaceutical companies or tax the insurance companies, but the proceeds will just fall in the black hole of the federal budget, which is not what we want.  If our contributions go to the patients, we are sitting down with all the parties trying to do a decent price reform in the way that the Americans are experiencing the cost when they go to their pharmacy to collect their medicines. So is it realistic or optimistic? I believe it is realistic. I believe that there is room for agreement both with the 2 sides of the aisle and with this administration. And we will continue working on finding this solution. But I repeat, make medicines affordable for the patients and not throw money to the black hole of the federal budget. Now Frank, if you can take the price increase and then Mikael. Thank you, Frank. And by the way, I wanted to add that this minus 5% that it is the reality of the numbers. I'm sure that many Americans haven't experienced, during this quarter, a 5% reduction in their out of pocket because it's a system that works in a way that no matter what you do on the top, their price that they have to pay is derived from very different rules. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the resistant mechanism in the mRNA or RSV? Thank you very much, Steve. Mikael, would you like to take the DMD question? Is it a technical issue . Yes, yes. Thank you, Mikael. And Steve, it's true that in order to achieve what was achieved during the -- with this vaccine, the ingenuity of our people was a key component but also a lot of personal sacrifice had to be involved. So a lot of the people who worked day and night, a lot of these people, worked days and nights to make sure that this happens. And that clearly, it is taking a toll on them. And no matter how proud they feel because the passion that they have can keep them going forever, I am concerned that we need to find ways so that these people will not break them out.  But I need also to emphasize that Pfizer is run in the form of business units. Since 2016, when I was running the business that basically underlies running right now and to have organized the whole operations into 6 business units. And that involved the R&D, the commercial and the clinical development. So the work for COVID happened in 1 of the 6 business units and happened predominantly in the R&D domain of these clinical units. But at the same time, the oncology business unit and the disease business unit and the internal medicine business unit and all the other business units that we are having kept working on their normal, let's say, workload, let me put it that way.  They of course, also to overcome issues related with the COVID-19 that didn't make the work very easy. But again, they were being able to rise to the occasion because I believe everybody in Pfizer right now is so strong believer of a that patients come first. And this is not about that. So this sense of sacrifice that we see in the vaccines, we have seen it also in the other units. People are very passionate about what they do and they feel very proud.  So I'm giving the answer to say that there is a very intense, let's say, disruption that happened in part of the organization, not in the entire organization and -- but has been offset by an incredible sense of pride that those people are taking because of what has been achieved. So I can't control them in terms of how hard they are working right now on all the other vaccines, for example. Yes. Thank you very much. In terms of -- let me start with that. In terms of the vaccine in India, we applied months ago, as you know. And in -- we have -- and we applied exactly the same file that we gave to the entire world, the FDA, EMA, Japan, everybody in the world. India wanted to do additional studies in order to approve this vaccine over there, which clearly, we were not ready to allocate resources and something like that, whether when we were allocating all the resources to do things into the variants, the kids, pregnant women and I can go on things that who haven't done it before.  But the Indian governments are really very good in having discussions right now with us about all these issues that you have raised. So we are hopeful that they would change this policy about conducting some local trials, and we will find a path forward so that we can provide the vaccines. That being said, the key thing right now today in the next 1 or 2 months, it is that people are dying in hospitals in India, and vaccine will not change that in the next 1 or 2 months. I think that will be a reality that we have to live with right now.  And what is more important is to make sure that the Indian government has enough medicines to treat the people but they are going to be hospitals right now. And this is why I guess we announced that for 4 of our medicines, that they are in their governmental protocol because the authorities have developed a protocol of treating COVID patients. And there are 4 of our medicines involved in these protocols. We will provide enough of these medicines for every patient in every public hospital in the next 30 days.  And as we speak, we are ramping up production of these medicines in Europe, in the U.S., in Asia. And we are ramping up distribution channels so that we can ship, as quickly as possible, those medicines to India because the need is immediate.  Now on the capital allocation, I will ask also Frank to make some comments here, but very few things are changing because of that. Our strategy on capital allocation was not driven with how much capital we have, was driven with how much opportunity we have. So we never say never to anything. So we maintain the eye to see be flexible. But clearly, Frank spoke about it, a growing dividend, it is a part of our investment thesis so that will be maintained. And also, we said that our investment in research, our investment in manufacturing, our investments of our capital are all aiming to improve the longevity, how durable it is our growth in the second part of the decade.  So you should expect to see a lot of Phase II, Phase III business development deals that will allow us to bring in-house a lot of potential medicines that could become medicines in this time frame. Frank, anything to add? Frank? Thank you, Frank. Mikael, about the technical question? Yes. Thank you, Tim. And Mikael, do you want to take the question about the flu? Thank you, Mikael. And then, Frank, I know you did answer the pricing, but do you want to say a little bit more about it? Correct. As regards to flu vaccine, we had a elaboration with BioNTech that goes back to 2018. At the time, we had announced also publicly some of the terms of this agreement. And the developments are based on the work that has been done so far by both companies on the flu.  As regard to the question of co-formulated, we didn't announce a co-formulation with Prevnar right now. We announced co-administration with Prevnar. Clearly, we are looking at options to co-formulate the BioNTech-Pfizer mRNA vaccine against COVID with other, let's say, vaccines. But this is not what we spoke about today and we haven't made final decisions on co-formulate. And I think Chuck, we do not have time for another question, right? Okay. I wanted to thank everyone for joining us today and for your continued engagement with Pfizer.

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Albert. I thought you outlined, in an excellent manner, that we have identified a handful of key points related to immunity was induced by convalescent after injection of vaccine that will, over time, as expected, show some decline. Antibodies will show some decline as their half-life are limited. Of course, protection contains other immune mechanism.  When you put all of this in context that SARS-CoV-2 is globally circulating to extent we have rarely seen or ever seen in our lifetime of a virus, and the inability to control across the globe will, of course, lead to numerous changes in the viral mutation rate. So it just punctuates what Albert said, we need continuously to keep up a very high immune pressure against the virus to stay ahead of the curve. And the best way to do that is with regular boosting.  And finally, herd immunity, while we would like to see it established, what you hear from a lot of public health and global health state emerging is that it will be really difficult on enlarged continent to establish such a high immunization rate across all ages and to ensure as you immunize one part of the continent that immunity is maintained at another part. So I think we would really need to rely on regular immunization and, of course, other public health measures rather than hoping that herd immunity across the globe can be established.  Finally, on the JAK safety, already in February 21, FDA made it public about our data in 11.33 related to increased risk of serious heart-related problems and certain cancer when compared to another type of medicines, the TNF inhibitors. So these data are clearly not new. FDA, EMA and other agencies work in dialogue with us to finalize the outcome of this review. On the other hand, I think the JAK class has shown to be an important contribution as an oral alternative for many patients, and you avoid other issues such as drug antibodies with the biologicals.  So we continue to wait for finalization of the outcome of the 11.33 trial. We think each JAK inhibitor is unique and needs to be assessed by itself. And we continue to believe that with proper labeling and given the tremendous experience of Xeljanz since 2012, it will continue to have a potential to be an important medicine. Yes. I think we cannot, of course, predict what CDC and similar agencies will do. But what seems to be the general public dialogue and which, of course, builds on experience with other viral epidemics, and this is, of course, a pandemic, is that you would likely start with those that are most susceptible, older adults, those with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, obesity, COPD, asthma, many that are immune-impaired. And of course, that constitutes a very large population.  While you may start with those, if we are to really maintain control of the virus, it will be very reasonable to assume the importance of also vaccinating younger groups. Although severe COVID is less common in younger groups, some patients may suffer severely from such infection, and they are at risk also of acquiring Long COVID syndrome, which can caused significant impairment of participation in functional life for young individuals as well as old. So all in all, yes, regular boost of entire population is a clear possibility priorities to start, of course, with many vulnerable from age to chronic diseases, which is a large number of adult population. Yes, thank you. I'll start with mRNA. As you discussed here, Geoffrey, of course, there is tremendous viral amounts across the globe fueled by the spread in large population areas like India. We do see several different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 established. They, however, seem to share the most critical mutations. Most of the variants have up to 10 mutations and they can combine on different ways.  So far, we believe that our B2, the current vaccine is very effective in controlling all known mutations. But as Albert alluded to, we believe it's very important to keep up very high neutralizing antibody levels in addition to the nice T cell immunity. And that's why a possible outcome of this tremendous spread, including India, is to have a regular boost.  As the pandemic continues, up to now, mutations have been selected mainly because the virus is trying to spread more quickly. The virus will now face vaccinated immunity in maybe '22, '23 increasingly. So we need to be prepared that there could be new unexpected mutations to come. And that's why Pfizer is leaving no stone untouched and also have variant vaccine developed and could be an alternative later if that scenario would emerge. But right now, it seems like the current vaccine is very effective against all these variants despite each having up to 10 different mutations.  On the RSV, well, we had very robust titers with our protein-based RSV vaccine in maternal vaccination, very good tolerability and antibodies passed efficiently through the cord blood. And we are enrolling now well in Phase III. We also have initiated a Phase II CHALLENGE study with RSV that will read out mid of the year, and that could possibly lead to progression swiftly into Phase III. So we are pretty advanced with the protein base, it looks very good. But of course, we have now an mRNA platform that we would like to use for multiple opportunities. We expect to put into the clinic, 2, first in humans, novel vaccines every year for the next 2 years. Certainly, RSV could, in the future, be 1 alternative, whether it could be a supplement to the protein base in order to add some T cell immunity. These are things we'll continue to explore and then prioritize among the many exciting opportunities for our mRNA platform. Yes. So the DMD trial, first of all, and I think Albert mentioned that in his introductory remark, is enrolling in many different countries. And in each of those, we had a matrix of assays that were cleared and -- by the regulatory authorities. The particular discussion with FDA is more of a technical issue on how to do a quantification in 1 supportive assay but not really as per our view in any of the main assays.  So we continue to work with them and aim to resolve it. I want to point out that to the best of my knowledge, we were first to start DMD Phase III, now enrolling well outside the U.S. late last year. And we are probably -- by now we're entering May, 6 months ahead of anyone using yield therapy as it as least public, it hasn't been disclosed any other having been cleared with FDA. Yes. The core assays that you alluded to related to AAV and transient effectiveness are all without any real comments by FDA so they're all fine. This is what I call a supportive assay, an adjunct assay that was more related to colocalization of the DMD protein and discussions on various technologies how to measure that. And as I said, in Europe, as this was an adjunct assay in other countries, we have cleared and enrolled efficiently and progressing towards the next step of the trial very well.  So it's a very technical issue how to do a detection but not related to the core potency assays. And obviously, we're working to resolve it. But what I understand currently, there is no other potential gene therapy in U.S. that have cleared yet to Phase III. And we obviously would like to be first, no just ex U.S. where we've been going for 6 months but within U.S. and work diligently to resolve this very technical question. Yes. With the flu vaccine, given the strong immune response we have seen for our mRNA platform, we certainly hope to be able to show substantial differentiation versus current flu vaccine. This is, of course, the aspiration we have. Technically, there will be 2 components: one is to look at immune response on antibodies that have certain standards reported related to increase in titer. And we will be able to compare to the current protein-based flu vaccines. And then we're also planning to run a vaccine efficacy study, where we think it's not just what we hope to be a very potent antibody response but also the T cell response.  So I would certainly aspire to that we would have a vaccine that is to be substantially meaningful better than the current vaccine based on the platform by itself but also based on that we are able, so fast, to align the platform with the sequence of the emerging flu strains, while as you may know, many years, the protein base are misaligned, and that's why you get very modest vaccine efficacy on maybe just 50% and similar for immune responses. So given that we saw 95% efficacy against COVID, we think there is a large module for us to improve on the current flu vaccine.  On the timing, Albert said we are moving to start human trials in Q3. And we will obviously, early on, generate data on the immunogenicity. And if that continued to go as well as our aspiration, we think we can move very fast with this vaccine and also utilizing the type of approach where you establish a large number of sites in the regions to study in order to enroll very fast. And we will look at various ways to register this vaccine and also how that could coincide with the recommendation by  So while we don't give at this early time an exact date but it anticipated we will move very fast, may not be as fast as a pandemic development but much faster than the traditional flu development."

            "content": "Thank you, Albert. Good day, everyone. I know you've seen our release so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. Clearly, the COVID-19 vaccine has had a dramatic positive impact on our year-over-year results, and Albert has addressed the key points on the COVID-19 vaccine landscape.  Looking at the income statement. Revenue and adjusted cost of sales was significantly impacted by COVID-19 vaccine sales and the associated 50% gross profit split with BioNTech, which we recognize on the cost of sales line. Revenue increased 42% operationally in the first quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and solid performance from a number of our other key growth drivers. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced gross margin by 10 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2020, which primarily reflects the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine gross profit split, which accounted for approximately 8 percentage points and, to a much smaller extent, product mix.  Looking at the business excluding the COVID-19 vaccine contribution, we saw a continuation of solid revenue growth for the business in the quarter, which nicely supports our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% through the end of 2025. As a reminder, this growth projection continues to exclude any contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine.  In addition, compared with the prior year quarter, first quarter 2021 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $400 million as a result of the first quarter 2021 having 3 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in international markets. This increase in selling days will be offset in fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in essentially the same number of selling days in full year '21 as compared to full year 2020.  However, the favorable impact on quarter-over-quarter comparisons in first quarter 2021 from selling days partially offset by the nonreoccurrence of favorable revenue impacts related to COVID-19 in first quarter 2020, including increased demand for certain products of approximately $150 million and additional wholesaler inventories of approximately $100 million. Given these factors, the net favorable impact on first quarter 2021 revenues is approximately $150 million or approximately 1.5 percentage points of operational growth, which in effect reduces a strong 8% operational growth rate to about 7%.  Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was up 44% compared to the year-ago quarter, while adjusted diluted EPS grew 47% for the quarter. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a 3% positive benefit to revenue and a 1% benefit to adjusted diluted EPS.  Let's move to our revised 2021 guidance. We've again provided total company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine, and then we provided some additional sub-ledger detail on our assumptions regarding the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution, so you can also see our projection for the business without the COVID-19 vaccine.  To start, the adjustments we've made to our total company guidance are almost entirely due to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 vaccine and R&D spending on incremental COVID-19 programs and non-COVID-19 mRNA programs, along with a small increase in the revenue outlook for the business excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. For adjusted cost of sales, the ranges have increased to 38% to 39%, which incorporates the incremental anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which has a significantly higher cost of sales due to the gross margin split with BioNTech as compared to the rest of the business. The projected COVID-19 vaccine revenue as a percentage of total company revenue has increased to 36% as compared to 25% in our initial 2021 guidance.  On adjusted SI&A, we have maintained our initial guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion. In addition, we increased our adjusted R&D guidance range to $9.8 billion to $10.3 billion to incorporate anticipated spending on incremental COVID-19-related programs and other mRNA-based projects that are not part of the BioNTech partnership. Working this through with a projected 15% effective tax rate yields an increased adjusted diluted EPS range of $3.55 to $3.65 or 59% growth at the midpoint compared to 2020, including an expected 4% benefit from foreign exchange.  Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions in context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. As referenced earlier, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50-50 gross margin split. Pfizer will book the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, where we receive a profit share from BioNTech and we do not participate in China. We now expect that we can manufacture up to 2.5 billion doses in '21, subject to continuous process improvements, expansion at current facilities and adding new suppliers and contract manufacturers.  As of mid-April, we have contracted for approximately 1.6 billion vaccine doses to be delivered in 2021 and still have contracts for potential additional doses under review. Based on the approximately 1.6 billion doses, we are now forecasting approximately $26 billion in COVID-19 vaccine revenue this year. We continue to have 3 pricing tiers for government contracts depending on the relative wealth of nations.  Our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue continues to include manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expense as well as a payment to BioNTech representing the 50% gross profit split. We continue to expect that the adjusted income before tax for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to be in the high 20s as a percentage of revenue. This margin level also includes the anticipated spending on additional mRNA programs. As I noted earlier, the COVID-19 vaccine is now projected to account for 36% of total revenue for 2021, up from 25% in our initial guidance for the year.  Let me add that if we contract for additional delivery of doses during the year, we will provide a guidance update in our subsequent earning releases. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution from both periods, you will see that we slightly increased 2021 revenue range to be between $44.6 billion and $46.6 billion, representing approximately 6% operational revenue growth at the midpoint.  In terms of adjusted diluted EPS, we continue to project a range of $2.50 to $2.60, which represents approximately 11% operational growth at the midpoint. These growth rates are all consistent with how we've been publicly positioning the business post the Upjohn separation.  You likely saw our announcement that we have maintained our dividend payment for the second quarter at its current level despite Viatris announcing their expected dividend payment. For those continuing to own Viatris shares, this effectively represents an increase in the dividend income, and our Board felt that the strength of our business supported maintaining our dividend. For the foreseeable future, we expect our Board to continue to support annual dividend increases at approximately this year's level. Obviously, we have no say as to what Viatris does with its future dividend.  In summary, a tremendous start to 2021. The COVID-19 vaccine continues to benefit millions of people around the world, and the business is on track for anticipated solid top and bottom line growth. We remain focused on advancing our pipeline, supporting in-market brands and looking to deploy capital responsibly, with a focus on initiatives that can solidify our long-term revenue and earnings growth outlook. With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck. Sure. Thank you, Albert. So I think it's premature to comment on what impact the proposed tax reform would have in our -- how we view capital allocation and inversion simply because these kinds of proposals typically go through multiple iterations, multiple discussions, multiple negotiations. Obviously, we're staying very close to this, doing all the analytics that you would expect us to do.  But I think what's really important is how we think about taxes and tax policy. 2017 tax reform leveled the playing field for U.S. multinationals against foreign competitors. And that was an enabler, from my perspective, of much of what we've done with capital deployment, particularly in the U.S. We committed to $5 billion of CapEx investment between 2018 and 2022. We committed a few billion of that risk capital in order to develop the COVID vaccine. Funding of our U.S. qualified pension plan that we did last year to the tune of over $1 billion.  All of those, from my perspective, were enabled by the level-playing field that we now get to compete on against our foreign competitors. And so what we want from tax reform, when all is said and done, is we want that level-playing field to continue so that we have the ability to compete on a level-playing field. So that's my answer, Albert. Okay. So you've heard Albert and me talk about pricing and that pricing has been a headwind, and we expect it to continue to be a headwind for the foreseeable future. And that's obviously what we saw this quarter, with pricing being a negative 5% on a global basis. I should also mention it was negative 5% in the U.S.  Now in terms of our guidance, which is what you asked, Geoffrey, our guidance assumed the pricing decrease, negative impact, I'll call it in the range of low to mid-single digits. So that 5% reduction that we saw this quarter is consistent with what we assumed in our annual guidance. Yes, Vamil, you're absolutely right. Obviously, the COVID business is generating incremental free cash flow for us, but from my perspective, not material enough to have any major impact on our capital structure. And to Albert's point, the term I would use is we will stay the course in terms of how we deploy our capital. And then Albert obviously potential areas where we would deploy it, right? The dividend, investing in the business and you saw that with the R&D guidance increase this quarter and then M&A and M&A really focused on growth in the second half of the decade. Thank you, Albert. So on pricing, Umer, I really want to not get into detail on pricing other than obviously, there are certain contracts where we disclosed with the prices. In terms of the way I think about this, what we're really focused on now is getting doses to the patients that need doses around the world so getting people vaccinated. That's been our focus. That's -- we're acutely focused on that.  You heard in our prepared remarks, we said we can make approximately 2.5 billion doses this year. We can take that up to 3 billion doses next year. And that's what we're really focused on, right, getting those made, getting them delivered and getting vaccines into patients' arms. So that's the focus.  On the Canada contract, we didn't discuss pricing on that contract. What we did say was up to 125 million doses in 2022 and 2023, with an option for more doses in 2024. And then in terms of the durability of the franchise, I'm going to try not to repeat what Albert said, but I thought Albert went into a lot of detail on why we believe the COVID revenue franchise has significant durability and why we think we see that as something that's going to take place for the foreseeable future. And Albert went through a lot of the details how we believe that is. Sure, Albert. And this was more about the 5-year CAGR through 2025. So I think, Tim, the way I think about it is we really look at pricing by geographic region. And we consider -- we continue to believe it's going to be a headwind by geographic region. What would be examples of that? The U.S. would be one, emerging markets would be one. Developed Europe would be one, just as an example. They all range in, I'll call it, negative pricing increases and the range is low single digits to high single digits. And obviously, we blend that all together into an overall global rate, and that's what we've assumed in our CAGR assumptions through 2025."

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this morning\u2019s call, I will touch on some of our highlights from 2022, and share some thoughts regarding Pfizer\u2019s exciting near and long-term growth plans. 2022 was an outstanding year for Pfizer on multiple fronts. We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174-year history. We maintained our industry-leading clinical success rates and further improved our cycle times, which already were among the industry\u2019s best. We were named to 10 different \u201cbest employer\u201d lists, including those published by Forbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor and others. And most important, more than 1.3 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. A truly humbling achievement. Our key growth drivers for the full year 2022 included: global sales of Paxlovid, strong growth for Comirnaty in developed markets, the launch of Prevnar 20 for the adult population in the U.S., the continued strong growth of Eliquis globally, the strength of our Vyndaqel family globally, and the addition of newly acquired products Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta. Looking ahead, we foresee strong operational revenue growth of 7% to 9% in 2023, excluding revenues from our COVID-19 products and the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our potential new launches, newly acquired products and inline products will all contribute to this growth. These projections include our forecasts for several important potential product launches, including our RSV vaccine for older adults, potential Prevnar 20 pediatric indication, and products and candidates that came to us through recent business development activities, including etrasimod for ulcerative colitis, Nurtec and zavegepant for migraine, and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. We\u2019re in the midst of an 18-month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market. 15 of these 19 are from our internal pipeline, with the remaining 4 coming to Pfizer, as just explained, via the recent business development deals. Recognizing the importance of these potential launches, as well as those expected in 2024, to both Pfizer and the patients who rely on our innovations, we are increasing the support we are putting behind them by investing an incremental $1.3 billion in SI&A expenses in 2023. Dave will provide more details on these investments during the presentation. One example of a product that is already benefitting from this additional support is Cibinqo, which recently has seen an improving growth trajectory that we expect to continue through the course of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cibinqo\u2019s new-to-brand prescriptions grew 84% sequentially, the fastest growth rate in the class. We have started 2023 with 55% commercial formulary access, and we expect that access to continue to improve during the year, especially with the upcoming expected expansion of the U.S. indication to include adolescents, 12 to 18 year-olds, if approved. We also introduced a new direct-to-consumer campaign in November, which has increased patient awareness of Cibinqo and led to more patients asking their doctors about it. We look forward to the expected U.S. launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, if approved, as well as the expected launch of Abrilada, our biosimilar to Humira, to further expand our franchise in immunology this year. However, we recognize that investors are not only interested to hear this year\u2019s guidance, but also to understand the long-term growth prospects of the Company. Particular questions are focused on our plans to offset the expected $17 billion impact of the LOEs between 2025 and 2030, and our long-term projections for our COVID-19 products. We will try to address both, starting with this slide regarding our business, excluding COVID. As you can see in this chart, we expect the 15 of the 19 potential launches that are coming from our internal pipeline to generate 2030 revenues that will more than offset the expected LOE losses forecast for 2025 to 2030. The potential $20 billion in this chart is a risk-adjusted number. I would also point out that some of the potential launches are expected to be bigger contributors to our growth than others. And if all 15 were to achieve their full potential, this figure could go even higher. In addition, we believe we have the ability, if successful, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 topline expectations through business-development activity. As we have said previously, we believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion in expected 2030 revenues. I am very pleased to see that the analysts\u2019 consensus expectations for the same revenues have already reached $9.5 billion, closing materially the gap that previously existed between internal and external expectations. Four of these products have already launched or are expected to launch, subject to regulatory approval, in 2023. We also have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. And, of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the 2024 to 2030 timeframe, if successful in clinical trials and approved. Some of the most promising assets include: our oral GLP-1 candidate for diabetes and obesity, all of them are under this dotted box, XB; potential combo vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and RSV; our potential vaccines for Lyme disease and shingles; multiple new oncology product candidates, including ARV-471 and our CDK4 inhibitor for endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer; our gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, hemophilia B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our pan-hemophilia A&B antibody treatment; and many more. If approved, we expect each of these to be key incremental contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. Even without any of these additional potential products, we expect our 2025 to 2030 revenue CAGR to be approximately 6%. And if some of them are successful, the CAGR could exceed 10%. Now, let me turn my attention to our COVID-19 portfolio. At the JP Morgan Conference earlier this month, I spoke about expecting 2023 to be a transition year, representing a low point in our COVID-related revenues. Let me provide a little bit more color on that. I will start with Comirnaty in the U.S. as an example. In 2022, 31% of the population, or 104 million Americans, received on average 1.4 doses of COVID-19 vaccines for a total of 144 million doses. Comirnaty\u2019s share was 64%, or 92 of these 144 million doses, as you can see in the first column. In 2023, we expect about 24% of the population, or 79 million people, to receive vaccine doses for COVID during this year. This drop is due to expected fewer primary vaccinations and reduced compliance with recommendations. We expect they will receive about 1.3 doses per person on average in 2023. The drop is because fewer people are expected to receive their primary doses and, for the most part, only those who are older or at higher risk are expected to continue receiving more than one booster per year. This should result in about 102 million total vaccine doses administered in 2023. We believe Pfizer will maintain at least its 64% market share and therefore expect about 65 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be administered in 2023. In 2024, we expect the utilization rates and market share figures to stabilize and come in roughly the same as in 2023. Then starting in 2025, and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of a COVID/flu combination product. A successful introduction of a COVID/flu combo could over time bring the percentage of Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine closer to the portion of people getting flu shots, which is currently about 50%. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar with some variations from country to country. So, what does this mean for revenues? We expect 2023 to be a transition year in the U.S. In 2022, we sold at pandemic prices more doses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably the second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Comirnaty through commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the doses sold and doses used in a year will more closely align together and the commercial price to remain relatively stable with only inflation-like price increases. Now, let me briefly urn through Paxlovid. In 2022, we estimate that 110 million COVID-19 symptomatic infections were reported in the world, excluding China. Approximately 12% of them were treated with approximately 14 million oral therapy courses and Paxlovid had the lion\u2019s share of them with approximately 90% market share. Average was 86%, but in the second half of the year exceeded the 90%. Keep in mind that this reflects a full year of reported infections, but only a partial year of Paxlovid availability due to supply constraints in the first quarter of 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we expect infections to increase slightly at 2% annually, due to waning immune protection of the population resulting from reduced vaccination rates. Similarly, we expect treatment rates to increase as awareness, education and additional oral entries will grow the oral antiviral market. Finally, we expect Paxlovid to maintain very high share despite additional competitive entries, given its strong benefit-risk profile and brand recognition. So, what does this mean for revenue? As with Comirnaty, we expect 2023 to be a transition year for Paxlovid as well. In 2022, we sold at Pandemic prices more treatment courses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Paxlovid through the commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect in years 2024 and beyond that the courses sold and used will align closely together within every year. There has been a great deal of speculation regarding the new but uncertain market opportunity for Paxlovid in China, so let me share what we are seeing. We have an agreement with one company to import and distribute Paxlovid in China, local company, and we have a manufacturing agreement with another local Chinese company for local manufacturing. Pfizer shipped only tens of thousands of courses to China in fiscal year 2022. From December, which is the first month of our non-U.S. fiscal year, through March, we expect to ship millions of courses to meet local demand. We expect we will be able to sell effectively under government reimbursement through end of March. And despite China\u2019s recent decision not to include Paxlovid on the country\u2019s National Drug Reimbursement List, we expect to offer the product on the private market after April 1st unless, of course, a listing opportunity opens up before then. Lastly, I want to point out that while we are expecting increased utilization in all regions of the world as infections increase, we are not including any major new non-U.S. or non-China contracts in our 2023 forecasts. Let me close with a few thoughts regarding our scientific engine. R&D continues to be the lifeblood that fuels us as a company, which is why we plan to increase our R&D spend by at least 8.7% in 2023 to $12.4 billion and $13.4 billion range. In addition to the increased investments, we are taking steps not only to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times, but also to increase overall return on investment and R&D productivity. As you have seen in the last year, we continuously prioritize our pipeline to focus on the assets that represent potential breakthroughs and have the potential for generating higher returns, putting more capital behind larger opportunities like GLP-1, flu, elranatamab, and others. We are at an inflection point to act from a position of strength with our best-in-class R&D productivity, a robust pipeline of innovative assets and one of the highest R&D budgets in the industry. With that, I will turn it over to Dave to provide details on our fourth-quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Take it over, Dave.\nDave Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. Albert has already taken you through many of the key drivers of our full-year performance, so I will focus my opening remarks on some key highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 13% operationally, primarily driven by Comirnaty\u2019s strong growth in developed markets following the slowdown in deliveries that we discussed in the third quarter ahead of the rollout of the bivalent booster. We also saw very strong performances from Paxlovid outside the U.S. and the ongoing launch of Prevnar 20 for adults within the U.S. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to our COVID-19 products, Pfizer\u2019s revenues grew 5% operationally in the quarter, and if recently acquired products from Biohaven and GBT are also excluded, revenues were up approximately 3% in Q4. Reported diluted EPS this quarter grew by 48% to $0.87, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 69% on an operational basis in the quarter. Both EPS figures include a $0.32 benefit from lower acquired IPR&D expenses compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Once again in the quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing fourth quarter revenues by approximately $2.5 billion, or 11%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19, or 24%, compared to LY. On a full-year basis, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $5.5 billion, or 7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.36, or 9%. Turning now to 2023 and the financial outlook for the Company. Let me first point out that our approach to guidance in 2023 is fundamentally different than prior years. Given the expected transition to commercial markets for our COVID franchise, and away from an Advanced Purchase Agreement environment, our guidance reflects our best estimates for revenues and profits for these products for the full year, not just what has been contractually secured. On a total company basis, we expect revenues of between $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect that revenues from our business excluding COVID will grow between 7% and 9% on an operational basis in 2023. That growth is projected to be split between contributions from our new product launches, our recently acquired products, as well as our in-line portfolio. The total company revenue declines are entirely driven by our COVID products, which are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024 and beyond. While patient demand for our COVID products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected to be fulfilled by products that were delivered to governments in 2022 and recorded as revenues last year. I want to point out that our total company revenue guidance range is wider than what is implied by the 7% to 9% operational growth rate range for the business excluding COVID. The wider guidance range reflects the potential volatility that we see in our COVID product revenues, given that they can be significantly impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the infection rates and the severity of the virus, as well as the timing for transitioning to a traditional commercial model here in the U.S. Now, you can see on this slide our cost and expense guidance for 2023. As I mentioned in my remarks at our investor event in December, both SI&A and R&D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus 2022, despite the fact that our overall revenues are coming down. Higher investments in SI&A are significantly focused on the successful launches of the large number of potential new products that Albert highlighted, as well as recently acquired assets. Additionally, the expected commercial launch of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will require additional investments as we transition away from the government market. These investments are squarely focused on supporting the Company\u2019s 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. We also intend to invest significantly into our research efforts this year, with multiple exciting and potentially high-value programs receiving additional funding, including our oral GLP-1 programs, elranatamab, and respiratory combination vaccines. All of this spending to support our commercial and research activities, we believe, will not only yield an attractive return, but will also contribute toward setting us on a path to achieve our long-term growth goals. I\u2019ll point out that when you exclude revenues and expenses related to COVID products, our expected operating margin profile this year is largely consistent with the prior year. This reflects incremental investments in SI&A related to launch products and R&D, as well as lower acquired IPR&D. In 2023, we are investing in both R&D and SI&A in advance of revenue contributions from new products. Looking longer-term, we expect this spending will be maintained, with the P&L growing into this cost base as new product revenues begin to be fully realized, with margins improving as a result. Given that 2023 is both a year of investment and transition, I thought it would be helpful to outline many of our key assumptions built into our guidance. I don\u2019t intend to walk you through all the elements here, but both slides 19 and 20 outline many of the details. In summary, these assumptions include: strong revenue growth of 7 to 9% in our business excluding COVID products; additional investments in SI&A and R&D to support Pfizer\u2019s near- and longer-term growth plans; continued patient demand for our COVID-related products worldwide, with vaccination rates declining slightly and utilization of treatments slightly increasing; rephasing of the European Commission Comirnaty contract over multiple years versus full delivery in 2023; and, finally, U.S. commercialization of the COVID products in the second half of 2023. In summary, as we enter a new year, our business is extremely strong, with many in-line, acquired and expected launch products capable of driving strong growth with an attractive pipeline of potential products coming in the future. We believe 2023 will be an important year for Pfizer, and that is why we are deploying our resources into quality execution in order to fully realize the growth opportunities we see within our portfolio and pipeline, which have the potential to impact our growth outlook through 2030 and beyond. So, with that, let me turn it over to Mikael.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Thank you, Dave. Today, I want to set the stage for an anticipated catalyst-rich 18 months. As Albert mentioned, we are in a position of unprecedented strength in our history and I\u2019m excited to share a high-level overview of an evolved strategy for Pfizer R&D to focus our resources on transformative programs which could be most impactful for patients, drive improved return on R&D investment and create the most value. We will leverage and continue to innovate our powerhouse capabilities in medicine design, and continue to innovate light-speed drug development to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times. We have rethought our approach to rare disease and will move from having a standalone research unit to aligning key programs with other therapeutic areas. We plan to externally advance rare disease programs that do not fit into a core therapeutic area of focus. At the same time, we plan to tap into the expanding external innovation ecosystem by actively pursuing biotech innovation and emerging innovation that fits strategically and accessing external assets that are differentiated. Taken together we believe these actions will help position us to lead the industry in reaching more patients with the most impactful near-term blockbuster breakthroughs while driving forward the next wave of innovations. I\u2019m pleased to share some examples with you today. We are pursuing potentially transformative efficacy in our inflammation & immunology franchise, with the potential launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, which both have the potential to be blockbusters, and a planned Phase 3 study start of anti-interferon Beta in dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Our next wave of innovation includes two monoclonal antibody candidates for atopic dermatitis which exemplify our multispecific platform and in-house biomedicine design expertise. Two assets currently in Phase 1 clinical trials each target three cytokines in a single therapeutic, so we refer to them as trispecifics. On the right are Phase 1 pharmacokinetic profiles of the average plasma concentration. For both molecules, the profiles suggest that once-a-month, or even less frequent, subcutaneous dosing may be supported. There is potential for improved efficacy with more potent interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 neutralization plus an expanded breadth of efficacy by blocking Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin to potentially cover more endotypes, or by blocking interleukin 33 (sic) [interleukin 33] to potentially enhance itch reduction. The Phase 1 studies continue. We aim to bolster our 30-year experience in hematology with a strong pipeline that complements our in-line portfolio and collectively has blockbuster potential. I will talk more about elranatamab and GBT-601 in a moment, so will highlight here that we expect multiple data readouts for TTI-622 in hematological malignancies, two Phase 3 readouts for inclacumab in sickle cell disease in the second half of 2024 and a Phase 3 readout for marstacimab in patients with hemophilia A or B in the second quarter of 2023. Marstacimab has FDA Fast Track designation for both, hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. If successful, we project submitting for the non-inhibitor indication in both A and B hemophilia in the third quarter of 2023. We recently announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate and expect a pivotal readout for our hemophilia A gene therapy in the first half of 2024. We recently presented strong updated Phase 2 data on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, CD3-targeted bispecific antibody, for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in heavily pre-treated patients who had received at least three classes of prior therapies. This candidate, which has the potential to be a leader in the BCMA bi-specific class, demonstrated a high objective response rate of 61% in patients with no prior BCMA-targeted treatment, early and deep responses, and a manageable safety profile. Given factors currently limiting the availability of novel therapies in the triple-class exposed setting, elranatamab has the potential to reach a broader and greater number of patients as an off-the-shelf option with reduced dosing frequency that is administered subcutaneously, offering more convenience than intravenous administration. With FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted last year, elranatamab could potentially be approved this year. As there is blockbuster potential and patient value beyond the triple-class refractory population, our clinical strategy aims to move to earlier lines of therapy and combination approaches with the potential, if successful, for multiple approvals to expand eligibility and duration of therapy. Now, to our next generation oral, once-daily, hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor candidate that\u2019s in a unique class and has the potential to expand the prophylactic treatment of people with sickle cell disease. Standard-of-care treatment rates have typically been low due to side effects, poor efficacy, or both. While Oxbryta made substantial progress in preventing hemoglobin polymerization, or sickling, GBT-601 is a potentially best-in-class candidate which may improve both hemolysis and frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. The most recent data from our Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study showed improvements in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels over time, mean hemoglobin occupancy of more than 32% for the 100 milligram maintenance dose and more than 41% for the 150 milligram maintenance dose, and improvements in red blood cell health with the higher maintenance doses. The maintenance doses were well tolerated. We believe these results may be transformative for patients, with a potential to achieve 35% to 45% hemoglobin occupancy, which is considered optimal for both hemoglobin oxygen affinity and preventing sickling, and approaches levels seen with gene therapies. This asset is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 study with a seamless Phase 2/3 design. We plan to start the Phase 3 part in the second half of 2023. Next, we aim to expand our leadership in breast cancer with a pipeline of complementary next-wave candidates. Our CDK4 inhibitor targets improving on CDK4/6 inhibition standard of care by maximizing CDK4 coverage. We are studying it in Phase 1 in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer as a single agent and in combination with endocrine therapy. The majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia that requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition, and that complete CDK4 inhibition by CDK4/6 inhibitors is challenging due to dose-limiting hematological adverse events. In the Phase 1 combination study, the confirmed objective response rate in combination with fulvestrant or letrozole reached nearly 30% and the clinical benefit rate was approximately 50% in 21 patients with measurable disease. The median progression-free survival was more than 24 weeks in 26 patients including 5 without measurable disease. All participants were heavily pre-treated with a median of four lines of prior treatment. All patients received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment and 67% received prior fulvestrant. The asset was well tolerated with CDK4 drug showing only 15% Grade 3 neutropenia and no Grade 4. Here, we show a scan of a patient who achieved partial response and was on treatment for 47 weeks. She had received six lines of prior treatment, including CDK4/6 inhibition and fulvestrant. We are currently engaged in dose optimization, enrolling CDK4/6-na\u00efve cohorts, and planning to start a randomized study in second-line treatment of estrogen receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer this year. Additional data readouts from our next wave of breast cancer candidates are anticipated in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we anticipate multiple milestones over the next 18 months. We expect a pivotal IBRANCE readout in hormone receptor positive/HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, a pivotal study start for ARV-471 and a Phase 2 readout for our KAT6 inhibitor. We have achieved incredible advancement in our vaccines portfolio, including candidates that harness our leadership in mRNA, with an unprecedented number of milestones expected. In addition to the expected launches shown here, we expect a Phase 3 data readout from our modRNA flu candidate vaccine, and a potential respiratory combination vaccine study start. A Phase 1/2 study of our shingles candidate, the first mRNA-based shingles vaccine program, began last week. In inflammation & immunology as well as internal medicine, key catalysts include potential launches of potential blockbusters, a planned pivotal study start with anti-interferon Beta and data readouts in metabolic disease. We\u2019re also making good progress in our anti-infectives portfolio, including anticipating full approval for Paxlovid, and planned study starts for both our second-generation COVID-19 antiviral candidate, which may have no or limited drug-drug interactions, and our RSV antiviral candidate. In closing, we are very optimistic about the many transformative catalysts emerging from the pipeline. Pfizer scientists are working with urgency and commitment to help the most patients as quickly as we can. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Mikael. Chelsea, why don\u2019t you poll for questions, please? We\u2019ll take as many questions as time permits and Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any detailed questions that we\u2019re not able to address on the call itself.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So first question I have for you is due expect your COVID/flu combo to be on an mRNA platform? And then, I wanted to ask you on this RSV vaccine, there\u2019s a few players in the space. And just wondering if you think anybody could potentially get a preferential recommendation from ACIP or is that really hard to achieve? And the last question is on your trispecific monoclonal antibodies. Is atopic dermatitis still a key focus for you? And if so, are you moving the focus to this monoclonal antibody, or are you still focused on etrasimod for atopic dermatitis and also you had an oral PD -- sorry, a topical PDE4 that was in development? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Louise. Clearly, for the ACIP, will depend on the data and it\u2019s difficult now to say if preferential could be achieved or not. But for both questions, COVID/flu is mRNA, RSV is not, Mikael, and then also what about the trispecific antibodies?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: So, as Albert spoke about Cibinqo\u2019s expansion, we think there\u2019s room for many opportunities in atopic dermatitis. We wanted to highlight this as a really novel pioneering approach to go beyond the current antibodies in atopic dermatitis with potentially many other allergic diseases. But there is room for several products in our pipeline in both oral and topical segment, as you mentioned. So, this is an area, I think, we will excel in.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And what about COVID/flu that is mRNA and RSV that it is not mRNA? How do you think about it?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Well, I think it actually offers an opportunity when you have the breadth to have a pipeline with different platforms. We think that the COVID/flu, which contains six components, and we have made a real good progress in enrolling the study in which start to share data in the near future has, by itself, of course, a Fast Track forward pending data. But for the use of a potential triple vaccine, rather than adding up more and more mRNA with the current technology that we have seen can lead to ritlecitinib limitation and less tolerability, we think this flexibility to add on a protein may give you the perfect balance between efficacy and tolerability.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And also to -- as you know, we are mastering multiple technologies in vaccine. So, we are using fit for purpose here. Every time we feel that the technology is appropriate for the problem we\u2019re trying to solve, we apply this technology. Flu and COVID, they are -- speed is of essence because there are variants that are coming. So mRNA is ideal position to address this challenge. With RSV, the virus is not changing that often. So, a protein approach that has a brilliant tolerability profile, almost like -- when we saw the data, the responses of the vaccine arm compared to the placebo arm were very difficult to separate, with very, very high efficacy in our case. I think it\u2019s the best way to move forward. That\u2019s the benefit having multiple approaches and multiple technologies. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two-part for me. I was just wondering if you can provide any more details on European vaccine -- the European vaccine contracts that were extended. Just wondering if you were able to secure a higher average price, given some of the headlines in the press earlier this week. And then, latest thinking on Paxlovid commercial pricing in the U.S. as well, was wondering if you could weigh in on that. And then the second question relates to economics with BioNTech on a combo vaccine. Just wondering how that will work in the event that you do go forward with a combined COVID and seasonal flu messenger RNA vaccine. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: I\u2019ll take the last one and then Angela will answer the European vaccine and the Paxlovid. As you know, the flu vaccine that we are developing, BioNTech also have an economic position into it. And of course, the COVID vaccine, it is a vaccine that we are sharing with them. So, we are not ready to make any comments regarding the economics about the potential COVID and flu vaccine. Angela, what about the European situation and Paxlovid pricing?\nAngela Hwang: So, for Comirnaty in Europe, as you know, this was a multiyear contract that we entered into with the Commission and the member states. And so I think the pricing there is what it is for the contract. And we\u2019re in discussions with the European Commission regarding \u201823 and what the deliveries will look like. Specifically for Pax, I think that was your next question, that is going commercial only later in this year. So, we are now preparing what those pricing scenarios could look like, and we\u2019ll share more at the right time.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. And also to repeat, I think David has mentioned it already that in our guidance for this year, we factor only a portion of the European contract. So, we spread the volumes into multiple years, although no agreement has been reached yet. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: So just to drill down a little bit on Paxlovid. It looks like a IQVIA numbers are implying about 9.3 million versus say the 12 million that you mentioned for 2022. So, I was wondering if you think about the split going forward ex U.S., could it be somewhat similar? Do you think it\u2019ll be more skewed, be more even to the U.S. and ex U.S.? And then my second question is, it also could imply that about half of your 20 million contracts were used in 2022. So, how do you think about -- could it be very minimal revenue as you draw down that Paxlovid and will that go into a stockpile? Thanks.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Well, let\u2019s start with the U.S. Paxlovid. So, in 2022, when we launched Paxlovid, we -- the first quarter of Paxlovid, the first quarter post launch, we did not really have sufficient supply because we were still ramping up. So, the total number of doses that were used in the U.S. for Paxlovid is actually less than the demand. So, that\u2019s why you see -- we used about 8.6 million, 8.9 million doses in the U.S. when actually demand was much more than that. Then you asked a question about IQVIA, the difference. As you know, IQVIA doesn\u2019t capture all the channels, so you\u2019re not going to see an exact match. But I think that in general for 2023, the number of doses that you will see for the U.S. and for ex U.S. is just going to be a function of the contracts that were made, the deliveries that we have to make in each of the countries and also the timing of the commercialization. And it just looks different in every single country.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. And also to emphasize that the 12 million, calculation is a global number, not a U.S. number. It\u2019s a global number. So, I believe the 9 million of IQVIA is approximately in the U.S. And -- but I don\u2019t know if they have also estimations for outside the U.S. So, next question, please. I\u2019m sorry for the -- it\u2019s a global number, excluding China, well that I mentioned. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Just have two. The first one is on COVID. When you look at the 2023 demand and beyond really for both products, I guess, I\u2019m trying to better understand the volume side of the equation. Are you guys baking in the emergence of, say, a new variant or maybe a change in behavior towards boosters? That\u2019s the first question. The second one is, from a BD perspective, Albert, you have a lot of cash to deploy. If your COVID assumptions don\u2019t quite play out, does that inform the number of deals or the size of deals? I guess, I\u2019m trying to get a view about where BD fits in your strategic priorities. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Of course. First, what is the assumption about the disease because that\u2019s a fundamental assumption behind all these projections that we are doing. It is that the disease will continue in the foreseeable future, manifesting clinically the same way that it has the last 6 to 9 months. So there will be mutations and there will be infections over there. And -- but the vaccination rates will be coming down because of lack of compliance but will stabilize to a certain degree of people, but they believe in vaccinations and they feel they are at high risk and they want to make their vaccines. At the same time, the infections were slightly going up because when you have waning immune protection for the population, then you will see more infections are actually more severe infections. So, these are the assumptions that we are using. We are not using assumptions that all the variants will have -- will escape in the protection of the vaccine. But we are using the assumptions that people will be getting 1.3 in the beginning and then going down 1.1, 1.2 doses per year as a normal booster. What was the second question? On the BD, yes, clearly, business development is, by far, one of our biggest priorities, something that I personally take care of and something that we have a very big team screening all the opportunities. I would like to ask Aamir, who is responsible for that area, to make some comments about our priorities.\nAamir Malik: So, Geoff, specifically to your question, you heard Albert described, we set this aspiration goal of $25 billion in 2030 from BD. We\u2019re over 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion of that number through the deals that we\u2019ve done. And we feel very confident that we\u2019ve got the financial flexibility on the balance sheet and the firepower to complete what we need to, to achieve that goal. And we\u2019re going to continue to be disciplined about how we pursue that.\nDr. Albert Bourla: I think we can move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Scala with Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I have a couple of questions. On page 4 of the release, Pfizer reiterated that non-COVID revenue growth in 2023 will be 7% to 9% and anticipates it will be split between launch, acquired and in-line products. That implies about $3.5 billion in incremental revenue growth. But in 2022, Prevnar alone grew $1 billion, and Eliquis and Vyndaqel together added another $1 billion. So with the launch in acquired products growing well, what does this guidance imply for the base business in 2023? It seems like a substantial slowdown is implied in the base business in the current year. Second question, has Pfizer learned anything from the Zeposia performance to date that would either increase or decrease its confidence in etrasimod? Thank you very much.\nDr. Albert Bourla: I would say, Dave, do you want to say how is allocated the growth between in-line, new products and acquired products?\nDave Denton: Yes, a really good question. I think if you look at each one -- each of those 3 buckets, we see growth from acquired products, we see acquired from new products and importantly, we see growth in our in-line portfolio as well. We do not anticipate nor do we see a slowdown in that perspective.\nDr. Albert Bourla: It\u2019s approximately 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And Angela, what about etrasimod?\nAngela Hwang: I think we\u2019re really excited about etrasimod as a new entry you see. It\u2019s a market that has been heavily dominated by biologics and then followed by of these JAKs after the biologics. But really, in the earlier treatment positions, there really hasn\u2019t been much innovation, and that\u2019s where we see etrasimod fitting in. I think the safety profile of etrasimod and its efficacy allows it to be used very well as an agent prior to the use of biologics. And that\u2019s where we see the ability to tap into a new segment and to grow.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And because I\u2019m very excited about the product, William, would you like also to add something about it?\nDr. William Pao: Yes. I would just say we\u2019re excited about the best-in-class profile with the study that we did, had a treat-through design. We hope and anticipate that we\u2019ll have no black-box warning. We don\u2019t anticipate any required for titration, the once-oral dosing, 100% of our patients were in complete remission after a year and that we\u2019re in complete remission after one year with steroid-free. And we also have quick lymphocyte recovery after discontinuation. So, we feel all of these features potentially make etrasimod a best-in-class profile.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Sure. That\u2019s exactly the point. Best-in-class in an area that it is poorly served right now with current solutions, so we see a lot of opportunity. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS.\nColin Bristow: I guess, first question on COVID and to sort of piggyback on what Geoff was asking. Some of your slides and comments, you\u2019re clearly expecting a sort of stable vaccine utilization rate, when in the last 12 months we\u2019ve seen this number decline on a backdrop of a virus that is evolving to less clinically severe variants. And so, what underpins your confidence in these longer-term assumptions? And then also in terms of your COVID \u201823 guidance, you mentioned you\u2019d guided to a sufficient range of variations in infection rates, et cetera. I was just wondering how much an allowance you\u2019ve made for the potential timing or reduction in contractual orders that is the current situation with the Brussels negotiation? And then, maybe just a quick one on the pipeline DMD, this feels noticeably in the background versus other assets at the similar stage. Just, could you update us on your level of enthusiasm and commitment to this program, especially in light of the potential competitor approval in May of this year? Thanks so much.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. DMD, Mikael?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: We continue to be enthusiastic about gene therapy in DMD. I think we have actually published the strongest data on the two drugs with efficacy as well as a lot of biomarkers from our Phase 1 across a much broader age group than anyone else. And I can\u2019t comment when possibly someone else will get it registered. But, we expect data readouts within possibly less than a year. And we think that this could be a very important drug. And we will have randomized data, which is not the case for any other application currently to have at that size and scope.\nDr. Albert Bourla: As regards the assumptions of our COVID protection vaccines, for example, we are dropping the numbers. So for example, 31% of people receiving a vaccine, that was the actual in \u201822. We are going to \u201824. Then you are reaching a level of really people that they are really committed to the idea of getting vaccinations and they are looked by physicians that don\u2019t really believe in the vaccination, the value of vaccinations. We are also dropping the number of doses there. So, we\u2019ll go to 1.3. And then eventually, as the years progress, the number of doses that people will receive is small. Keep in mind that to get numbers like 1.2, you need a very, very small percent of population 2 doses, so that you can achieve something like that. Maybe 5% of the population to get a second dose, and then you will go to these numbers, as you will see, if you include also primary doses and children. So, we believe the assumptions are very reasonable with the expectations that COVID will remain as it is right now, so nothing more severe and nothing that will make it less disappearing and we take into consideration that the compliance with the recommendation of the health authorities also because of the fact, will be less. Clearly, pivotal moment will be the introduction of combination vaccines because the convenience of something like that and the fact that people are presenting themselves to receive flu vaccines, given that a combo vaccine would be in the same injection and will cost zero co-pay, likely will become the choice of many to get this full coverage. So, we have quite confidence on these assumptions. And of course, there are only assumptions. We need to wait and see. The other thing, it is -- on the Europe, you asked a few questions. I know that there are rumors, but I don\u2019t think that it is appropriate for us to make any comments while we are in negotiation with our partners in Commission and with the member states. So, we only said that we factor on part of the deliveries in this year instead of all the deliveries because we are in the middle of negotiations, but we can\u2019t make other comments. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse.\nTrung Huynh: Hi, guys. Good morning. It\u2019s Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. I have a quick clarification on COVID and then my question. So just on the clarification in those long-term COVID vaccine and Pax slides. Do you expect any U.S. government sales in \u201824 and \u201826? It just looks like commercial sales on your slides. So, does that mean Medicaid, Medicare populations are bought at a commercial price? And can you comment on the margin change for the vaccine and Pax as you step up to that commercial price? And secondly, just following on from the base business question from Steve, we saw lower revenues ex U.S. for some important base business drugs. So, Eliquis was down 19% ex U.S., IBRANCE minus 22% ex U.S., Prevnar, there was also a decline there. You\u2019ve noted some product-product related issues. But are you seeing anything more broadly in the U.S., which is making it for a more difficult environment? And going forward, should we expect more normal levels ex U.S. for these products?\nDr. Albert Bourla: A quick one because that\u2019s easy, we do not expect \u201824 and \u201825 and beyond to have governmental sales in the U.S. In fact, we think that not even this year, other than some small deliveries that we have still pending with the U.S. government from the -- before, we will not see any U.S. purchases. That\u2019s our assumption right now that we will move into a commercial model that will cover all channels as with all other vaccines and products. Margin changes, we haven\u2019t said anything yet about Paxlovid. So, I can\u2019t comment, if you can calculate. We set there is price, you can calculate the net and then you can make your assumptions on margins. We don\u2019t give margins on specific products. Now, a little bit on the lower revenues -- about the revenues ex U.S. Angela, do you want to make any comment on that?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. As you said, there were some specific reasons for why we saw what we saw for Eliquis, IBRANCE, PCV. I mean, Eliquis specifically was the loss of exclusivity and our patent challenges that led to some generic increase at risk in both the U.K. and Netherlands. I mean, IBRANCE is a mature product. And so, it goes through sort of the reimbursement and the sort of the pricing regulation that it typically goes through in Europe. And I think PCV in general, what we\u2019re seeing is that, at least on the kid side, not on the adult side, but on the kid side, vaccinations are still -- are not back up to where they are where it was prior to the pandemic. So, I think in all three cases, there were very specific reasons for what you saw. And we don\u2019t anticipate anything extraordinary or different in 2023. I think it\u2019s sort of business as usual.\nOperator: Next question will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. I think one of the challenges for analysts modeling Pfizer is to try to understand what the flow-through to profitability is from Paxlovid and Comirnaty. So, I\u2019m hoping directionally, you can tell us how that looks going forward once you get past this transitional year of \u201823. So, in \u201824 and beyond, is the profitability of that combined franchise likely to be higher, less or the same as what it was in 2021 and 2022? And then, a second question is on SG&A. How much of that increase was driven by inflation in 2023? And just any quick comments on your European austerity measures on pricing.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Dave?\nDave Denton: Yes. So on -- maybe on the COVID franchise, obviously, we don\u2019t give profitability for each product. But you can imagine, as we stated before, on the vaccine, we split our gross margin with BioNTech. So therefore, that would obviously carry a lower profitability mix compared to a typical product. And Paxlovid is probably the opposite in the sense that we share that -- the economics of that fully. So, that\u2019s probably a bit on the larger -- higher margin side in general.\nDr. Albert Bourla: You can predict that, for example, in the first years, \u201821, \u201822 had very high R&D expenses also. We maintain our R&D expense to COVID. Very big part of our expenses in \u201823 is for COVID because we are investing. But you expect over time, those unless if we bring new products that will not be as high as. On the contrary, prices are going up, but margins could improve but also SI&A, promotion expenses are going up, right? So, without wanting to give direction from what it used to be \u201821, \u201822, we expect going forward to be higher, the margins. But all of these equations will be in play. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe one question, if I can ask. So regarding the expenses for COVID business, Dave, you mentioned that you will be essentially relaunching these products with the commercial scale and everything. So is there -- so how much cost, given that your COVID business is declining significantly this year? Are you modeling any kind of cost cuts in that business or should more -- or dollar basis are still the same? And is there any synergies you can achieve, especially for vaccine with your existing Prevnar business because the channels are similar or not? And last part is, do you think you can do more share buybacks, given the stock price at this point? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Let me take the first two quickly. Of course, as you saw, the business is going down because of COVID, the average is growing. Expenses are going up because we are promoting new launches, including COVID. So right now, moving into Comirnaty in commercial and Paxlovid with commercial channels, now we treat them like normal promotional products, very sensitive in promotions at the beginning of their launch. So, we are going very hard with promotions, TV, field forces and all the other educational measures that we are taking when we do this type of launch. So there is -- clearly this speaks. What about, David, are we going to buy back?\nDave Denton: I think as we look at capital allocation at this point in time, we actually see a lot of opportunities to invest back into our business, both from a research perspective and importantly, getting behind our launches to make sure that we\u2019re doing all that we can to ensure that our growth trajectory in \u201825 and \u201830 and those goals and aspirations become reality. So, I think our best and highest use of capital right now is investing in our business, both internally as well as from a BD perspective. I would say never say never to an incremental share repurchase, but that\u2019s not high on the priority list at this point.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And Mohit also, you asked also about the synergies. Clearly, there are a lot of synergies right now both. In the Paxlovid -- Paxlovid is covered by a lot of physicians, and we have very, very strong primary care field force and we have very strong also vaccines field force that is covering all these physicians that we have, either vaccinate or prescribing Paxlovid. So, clearly, a lot of synergies in retail and in the medical profession also. Let\u2019s go to the next call, please.\nOperator: From Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just building on some of the OpEx discussion here. I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding the OpEx dynamic is properly over time. So, I guess, should we think about 2023 as more of a onetime step-up in OpEx and then much slower growth in \u201824 and beyond? Or should we be thinking about this a couple of year process as you really get the pipeline and new products ramped, and then it\u2019s maybe more second half of the decade before we think even about margin -- bigger margin expansion or is that OpEx slowing? I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding those dynamics properly. And then the second one was on the COVID/flu combination. I guess, is your expectation that the tolerability of that will be similar to what we see with Comirnaty, or is there some trade-off of we could see maybe slightly higher kind of side effects for the six components you mentioned but that\u2019s offset by the convenience? I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand what your expectations are for that program. Thanks so much.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, Chris. To this scientific question to Mikael, first.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. We think that the tolerability will be well on par with vaccines used in the target population and be perceived as tolerable and convenient. As you described, the combination will attract the high volume of flu people to also be able in shot to renew the COVID coverage, particularly with more and more variants coming. So we\u2019re very positive and think we\u2019re right in the balance of those and opportunity there.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. And, of course, Dave will say, but right now, this is the profile that we are targeting. And we think it\u2019s easy to do it with two viruses, so to load enough so that we have very good efficacy and good tolerability profile. We believe it will be more challenging, but of course, needs to be seen. And that\u2019s why we believe that our RSV -- protein and having such a good tolerability profile offers better combination of a triplet than triplet all with mRNA. Dave, also there was this question that I think you touched upon it earlier in your script about how we see going forward, the expenses of SI&A.\nDave Denton: Yes. So importantly, 2023, we\u2019re seeing a step-up in SI&A and it\u2019s really, again, investments around the launches and the products that have been acquired, which we think are really important to really drive growth in the back half of the decade. So, we\u2019re already focused on that. We do think \u201823 is probably the big year of step-up from expenses. And then post \u201823, those expenses will grow more moderately after that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. Thanks for all of the additional details that you\u2019re providing. So, it seems like the 2023 guidance is conservative, which is encouraging. But looking to Paxlovid longer term on slide 11, I guess I\u2019m surprised that the percentage of symptomatic patients that you expect to be treated with an oral therapy would almost double from 12% to 22% between \u201822 and \u201826, even though the pandemic is being viewed as being over. So, I\u2019m hoping that you could talk a little bit about those assumptions and what the denominator is. So, when you say symptomatic patients, is that high-risk/elderly that you\u2019re calculating the 12% on going to \u201822, et cetera? And then, in terms of the Paxlovid share, it was approaching 91% at the year-end of \u201822, according to this slide but only declining to 80% in \u201826 when there are several companies, both large and small, ranging from Gilead to smaller companies that are planning to develop agents to compete aggressively and that could have implications for both, volume and pricing longer term. So wanted to understand that.\nDr. Albert Bourla: David, very good questions. Let me try to explain a little bit. First of all, it\u2019s not 12% going to 22%. It\u2019s really 17% going to 22%, right? The 12% which is in \u201822,it is a partial year, so it didn\u2019t include the full year. The real demand, it is, let\u2019s say, \u201823 full year, it is 17%. And it\u2019s going up because of two factors: one, it is a small increase in infections. And as I explained, the assumption is that COVID will not disappear, will be there. But vaccine rates, vaccinations are going down. So that will create -- will wane the protection -- the protection of the population. And that will manifest with a small increase, which you factor, 2% based on our modeling, a small increase of both the infections and eventually also the severity. So, that\u2019s one. So, the second is that the more introductions of new entries rightly will not happen before \u201825 -- \u201824, \u201825 in the U.S. at least. Will depend if EUA will still be available, which will depend if we will be in a state of emergency or not for EUA. But if we will not be in a state of emergency, which could be like a scenario, there will be no EUAs, we don\u2019t see, in \u201824, any introduction, actually we see in \u201825 the introductions. The introductions though, also, as always, are increasing the overall cost. So, fact, it\u2019s what also is driving. We are dropping markets share but we are increasing the volume. The last is are we dropping the market share aggressively enough or are we, let\u2019s say, very optimistic in dropping. The assumption here it is that we are the only one, we have right now for years presence in the market with a label that is extremely strong with 86% clinical efficacy against hospitalization and against deaths -- high action against deaths. So, it\u2019s very difficult for anyone to reproduce this data right now, The studies will run forever likely and will be very large. So, very, very difficult to reproduce something like that. So as a result, given that for years, we will be among -- we will be basically the lion market share, plus the excellent profile, the loyalty that will be developed. All of that are telling us that it is very reasonable with -- to maintain very high market share, you can see that in first-in-class and it\u2019s in every treatment, from cancer to that compared to the second and third, it\u2019s easy to maintain 60%, 70% of the relevant conditions. Now that we have all these advantages, we think maintaining at 70%, 75%, I think, is reasonable. Of course, we\u2019ll have to see. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Two questions, one on Paxlovid cross-currents there between China in terms of the million doses that you described for your first fiscal quarter and a potential transition into a private market in China, and then, U.S. where a similar transition will occur to the commercial. Can you help at all frame what you think the relative contributions could look like in \u201823 and how that could progress? And then in particular for the COVID franchise products, can you share any early color on the discussions or engagement that you\u2019re having with payers? What kind of dynamics? Any color there would be helpful, particularly in the broader context of a global pharmaceutical opportunity with many different therapeutics that will be on their list of budget items, obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s, et cetera. So, any color on the discussions with payers would be helpful.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Angela?\nAngela Hwang: So I think for Paxlovid, again, the time period, the way to think about it is in two time periods from now until April, which is a reimbursed market, which gives us access to both public as well as private channels, and then after April, private channels only. As you heard, we have included in sour guidance what we believe we can do in the first three months of this year. But given the fact that the back half of the year, we will -- it\u2019s going to be highly uncertain. It will be a very dynamic market. We\u2019ll continue to make sure that we have supply, but we\u2019ll have to just wait and see what happens there. On the side of U.S., similarly, we will be transitioning this year. We will have a year where some of the revenue will be made through the completion of contracts that we made with the U.S. government in 2022. And then part of the year, the revenues will come from the commercialization of Paxlovid. So, you\u2019re going to see that play through -- both of those dynamics play through. And then I think you had one more question.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes, the payers -- what is the reaction with the vaccine or...\nAngela Hwang: Yes. So it\u2019s still early days, especially in the U.S., right, because that\u2019s only happening middle of the year. But what I can say is that we have had some early discussions already with agencies and reimbursement agencies outside of the U.S. who have given us, I guess, earlier feedback. And even if you take a country like the U.K., we actually had very favorable feedback on the pricing that we provided, and they agreed with the cost effectiveness of our Paxlovid. So I think we\u2019ll -- obviously, that\u2019s good feedback, and we\u2019ll be taking those learnings and those value arguments to multiple countries around the world.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Thanks for taking the questions. And David, thank you for all the transparency on the underlying assumptions. I guess, two for me. First off, just in terms of the upcoming, I guess, messaging around the end of the public health emergency. Can you talk about the potential impact you see on your EUAs, access as well, specifically thinking about Paxlovid populations in this period before we switch to a commercial market where you\u2019re still -- the government is still, I guess, working through the inventory they have in hand? And then, going to the COVID/flu combination, just trying to better understand some of your assumptions here. Because I guess when we think about that \u201826 40% adoption number, -- it\u2019s some -- I guess, either the incremental bump from \u201824, 15% or the 40% absolute, just kind of what that implies about how you think the underlying flu market will change. I guess, that complies 30% to 80% share within two years, but just wanted to understand kind of the underlying drivers there and how you think about that market evolving.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Maybe I try myself quickly because we\u2019re running out of time. If there is an end of emergency, we don\u2019t think that will have any impact on current in U.S., will have an impact on issuing new in U.S. I don\u2019t think that anything changes in the way that -- emergency or not, whether the inventories will be managed or the access that patients will have in any of these treatments. Now, as regards of COVID/flu, if the introduction of combination for products would change the flu market, I think, yes -- well, would say it\u2019s a major flu market was always a single market until now. And suddenly, there is a chance that other respiratory cases like COVID or RSV will come. So I think that would change. But now, the step-up, it is clear we expect that around 24%, 25%, it is a population in the U.S., that believes needs protection and is diligent enough -- not believes, more belief, but they are diligent enough to follow the recommendation and go and get their annual booster for COVID. When they will present themselves -- excuse me, when the flu people will present themselves and they will be asked that question, if you want flu single or flu with a combo, and they will be given the information that will protect them in a single injection at the same time, zero co-pay, for COVID as well, we believe it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the 25% stable will become 30%, so we\u2019ll add another 5% of the population. And that over time, that will move closer to the 50%, we project 40 over there. So, those are the assumptions that we\u2019re using. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: A couple of questions on vaccines please. Firstly, on RSV, can you confirm you\u2019re on track to provide that second season of data ahead of approval and reimbursement discussions in May-June for the older adult vaccine? And can you confirm whether you\u2019ve now filed your maternal RSV vaccine with the regulator? If not, are you waiting for the approval in the older adult setting first? And then just on the flu/COVID combo, if we assume you have positive flu Phase 3 data in the second half of the year, positive Phase 1 combo data in the first half, would you expect to move the combo into Phase 3, or is that the possibility you will not need a full Phase 3 combo study to proceed to filing an approval? Thanks.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Mikael?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. I mean, we always follow multi-seasonal vaccines and we\u2019ll share the second season data as soon as it\u2019s available. Of course, there are many ways this can play out with combination vaccines and which could lead to more regular vaccination rather than protracted. And on -- you also asked about the, let\u2019s say, the flu/COVID combo here.\nChris Stevo: Will we need a full Phase 3 trial or\u2026\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: So if we need a full Phase 3, if we have both flu and COVID? We expect that you need a Phase 3 that is based on immunogenicity and safety and not a large trial based on events. So, we think we can complete that fast. And if anyone can do it first, it\u2019s we. So, that\u2019s very high on our list currently pending data to move with light speed in.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Right. And there was a question on reinvestment of RSV question I think.\nDave Denton: Yes. I think, Kerry, you asked the second season durability data, how that will impact reimbursement discussions\u2026\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. I think it will impact ACIP recommendation in vaccines. Once you have ACIP recommendation or not, you\u2019re getting automatic actions with all formularies without co-pay. So, that, I think it will be the key what ACIP will say. And let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citigroup\nAndrew Baum: On Paxlovid, following commercial approval and the withdrawal of the EUA, will pharmacist prescribing remain intact? And then a couple for Mikael. Could you just explain the reasons for the out-licensing of the TL1A inhibitor to Roivant? I apologize if I missed it. And then second, in relation to your multispecific antibodies, your trispecifics, this has been tried previously, I think AbbVie and J&J previously tried in RA, and I think in psoriasis with TNF IL-17s but they ran into an issue with binding affinity and they didn\u2019t have efficacy. Do you think you\u2019ve managed to solve the issue here?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Andrew, the first one is simple, I don\u2019t know if the pharmacist will. It\u2019s very unlikely, I think. But I don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t have it in our assumptions right now. And let\u2019s go to Mikael.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: I\u2019ll start with, Andrew, great question. You touched my heart today. We have cracked it. These antibodies that I shared today have, first of all, pharmacokinetics like an excellent single antibody but 3-in-1 product and have very high potency, which you asked about, actually exceeding the marketed product substantially. So, we think it\u2019s really something that we will move very quickly as we learn more of it. And you asked about TL1A. We think we have a very good partnership with Roivant that helps us to do more things within our pipeline. And you\u2019ve heard Aamir Malik earlier alluded to that we have commercialization rights ex U.S., Japan. We have about half of the value of this product. And we have a follow-on bispecific TL1A p40 that\u2019s active mechanism of STELARA. So, we think we have such a richness in this space and really enjoy to build the ecosystem with others and maximize what we bring to patients.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Aamir, you want to add something here?\nAamir Malik: The only quick thing I will add, Andrew, is if you look at how prolific our R&D engine has been, the total funding demand from all of the R&D programs that were generated would significantly exceed what we guided to as our R&D spending in \u201822 and \u201823. So, in that context, we are going to be very thoughtful about how we prioritize. We have a robust process for that. And consequently, from time to time, you\u2019re going to see programs like the TL1A that have very clear scientific merit, but we think we\u2019re sharing the cost, the risk and capabilities with the partner is the best way to create value. And that\u2019s what we did in that situation. And we\u2019ve had a long history of doing that in a number of other situations as well.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Now, let\u2019s move to the last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO.\nEvan Seigerman: Thank you for squeezing me in. And I\u2019m not going to ask a COVID question because I think they were all asked. So, just looking at business development, when you hit Biohaven, what were some of the characteristics of the deal that you want to bring forward in kind of your go-forward approach for BD? How should we think about potential holes in your pipeline that you could fill with external deals? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Aamir, why don\u2019t you take this one?\nAamir Malik: Sure. The Biohaven deal for us represented an excellent opportunity to leverage our capabilities. And specifically, where were capabilities in terms of our global commercial footprint, that Biohaven as a company alone could not maximize but where application of those capabilities could take Nurtec and the follow-on product to places and reach us for patients that they couldn\u2019t have gotten to alone. And also the way in which we structured that transaction, began with an ex U.S. partnership, which we then expanded to take on the full global CGRP franchise and also excluded some assets that were less relevant to us strategically that created a newco. And I think what you can take away from that is that we\u2019re going to continue to look for things that are scientific breakthroughs where we can add capabilities and we\u2019re also going to be creative and disciplined about how we structure our deals. And we think that\u2019s going to serve us well as we complete our ambition against our $25 billion goal.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Aamir. So, thank you, operator. In summary, let me close by saying, first of all, I feel extremely proud for the team at Pfizer that was able to deliver -- break all records in 2022, the highest-ever revenue, the highest-ever profits, the highest, more importantly ever number of patients, that we protected or treated with our medicines. The best-ever reputation for our company, the most productive wave of R&D with 18 -- 19 products launching in the next 18 months, the best R&D machine in terms of multiple measures, all of that were able to achieve in 2022. Clearly though, I believe that the best years of Pfizer are ahead because we are building on a significant capital position that we know how to deploy to create growth. We are building on an R&D engine that it is more productive than ever in the history of this company, a manufacturing engine that it is the envy of the industry, commercial envy -- commercial engine that it is around again and again and again as the best commercial engine in the industry. And, of course, a mindset in Pfizer that is characterized but nothing is impossible. We can make everything possible. So with that in mind, I think that we are moving ahead, hopefully, to an even more successful 2023. Thank you very much for your attention, your interest in us and your support as shareholders. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Pfizer\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call.

            "name": "Dr. Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this morning's call, I will touch on some of our highlights from 2022, and share some thoughts regarding Pfizer's exciting near and long-term growth plans. 2022 was an outstanding year for Pfizer on multiple fronts. We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174-year history. We maintained our industry-leading clinical success rates and further improved our cycle times, which already were among the industry's best. We were named to 10 different \u201cbest employer\u201d lists, including those published by Forbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor and others. And most important, more than 1.3 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. A truly humbling achievement. Our key growth drivers for the full year 2022 included: global sales of Paxlovid, strong growth for Comirnaty in developed markets, the launch of Prevnar 20 for the adult population in the U.S., the continued strong growth of Eliquis globally, the strength of our Vyndaqel family globally, and the addition of newly acquired products Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta. Looking ahead, we foresee strong operational revenue growth of 7% to 9% in 2023, excluding revenues from our COVID-19 products and the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our potential new launches, newly acquired products and inline products will all contribute to this growth. These projections include our forecasts for several important potential product launches, including our RSV vaccine for older adults, potential Prevnar 20 pediatric indication, and products and candidates that came to us through recent business development activities, including etrasimod for ulcerative colitis, Nurtec and zavegepant for migraine, and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. We're in the midst of an 18-month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market. 15 of these 19 are from our internal pipeline, with the remaining 4 coming to Pfizer, as just explained, via the recent business development deals. Recognizing the importance of these potential launches, as well as those expected in 2024, to both Pfizer and the patients who rely on our innovations, we are increasing the support we are putting behind them by investing an incremental $1.3 billion in SI&A expenses in 2023. Dave will provide more details on these investments during the presentation. One example of a product that is already benefitting from this additional support is Cibinqo, which recently has seen an improving growth trajectory that we expect to continue through the course of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cibinqo's new-to-brand prescriptions grew 84% sequentially, the fastest growth rate in the class. We have started 2023 with 55% commercial formulary access, and we expect that access to continue to improve during the year, especially with the upcoming expected expansion of the U.S. indication to include adolescents, 12 to 18 year-olds, if approved. We also introduced a new direct-to-consumer campaign in November, which has increased patient awareness of Cibinqo and led to more patients asking their doctors about it. We look forward to the expected U.S. launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, if approved, as well as the expected launch of Abrilada, our biosimilar to Humira, to further expand our franchise in immunology this year. However, we recognize that investors are not only interested to hear this year's guidance, but also to understand the long-term growth prospects of the Company. Particular questions are focused on our plans to offset the expected $17 billion impact of the LOEs between 2025 and 2030, and our long-term projections for our COVID-19 products. We will try to address both, starting with this slide regarding our business, excluding COVID. As you can see in this chart, we expect the 15 of the 19 potential launches that are coming from our internal pipeline to generate 2030 revenues that will more than offset the expected LOE losses forecast for 2025 to 2030. The potential $20 billion in this chart is a risk-adjusted number. I would also point out that some of the potential launches are expected to be bigger contributors to our growth than others. And if all 15 were to achieve their full potential, this figure could go even higher. In addition, we believe we have the ability, if successful, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 topline expectations through business-development activity. As we have said previously, we believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion in expected 2030 revenues. I am very pleased to see that the analysts' consensus expectations for the same revenues have already reached $9.5 billion, closing materially the gap that previously existed between internal and external expectations. Four of these products have already launched or are expected to launch, subject to regulatory approval, in 2023. We also have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. And, of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the 2024 to 2030 timeframe, if successful in clinical trials and approved. Some of the most promising assets include: our oral GLP-1 candidate for diabetes and obesity, all of them are under this dotted box, XB; potential combo vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and RSV; our potential vaccines for Lyme disease and shingles; multiple new oncology product candidates, including ARV-471 and our CDK4 inhibitor for endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer; our gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, hemophilia B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our pan-hemophilia A&B antibody treatment; and many more. If approved, we expect each of these to be key incremental contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. Even without any of these additional potential products, we expect our 2025 to 2030 revenue CAGR to be approximately 6%. And if some of them are successful, the CAGR could exceed 10%. Now, let me turn my attention to our COVID-19 portfolio. At the JP Morgan Conference earlier this month, I spoke about expecting 2023 to be a transition year, representing a low point in our COVID-related revenues. Let me provide a little bit more color on that. I will start with Comirnaty in the U.S. as an example. In 2022, 31% of the population, or 104 million Americans, received on average 1.4 doses of COVID-19 vaccines for a total of 144 million doses. Comirnaty's share was 64%, or 92 of these 144 million doses, as you can see in the first column. In 2023, we expect about 24% of the population, or 79 million people, to receive vaccine doses for COVID during this year. This drop is due to expected fewer primary vaccinations and reduced compliance with recommendations. We expect they will receive about 1.3 doses per person on average in 2023. The drop is because fewer people are expected to receive their primary doses and, for the most part, only those who are older or at higher risk are expected to continue receiving more than one booster per year. This should result in about 102 million total vaccine doses administered in 2023. We believe Pfizer will maintain at least its 64% market share and therefore expect about 65 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be administered in 2023. In 2024, we expect the utilization rates and market share figures to stabilize and come in roughly the same as in 2023. Then starting in 2025, and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of a COVID/flu combination product. A successful introduction of a COVID/flu combo could over time bring the percentage of Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine closer to the portion of people getting flu shots, which is currently about 50%. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar with some variations from country to country. So, what does this mean for revenues? We expect 2023 to be a transition year in the U.S. In 2022, we sold at pandemic prices more doses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably the second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Comirnaty through commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the doses sold and doses used in a year will more closely align together and the commercial price to remain relatively stable with only inflation-like price increases. Now, let me briefly urn through Paxlovid. In 2022, we estimate that 110 million COVID-19 symptomatic infections were reported in the world, excluding China. Approximately 12% of them were treated with approximately 14 million oral therapy courses and Paxlovid had the lion's share of them with approximately 90% market share. Average was 86%, but in the second half of the year exceeded the 90%. Keep in mind that this reflects a full year of reported infections, but only a partial year of Paxlovid availability due to supply constraints in the first quarter of 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we expect infections to increase slightly at 2% annually, due to waning immune protection of the population resulting from reduced vaccination rates. Similarly, we expect treatment rates to increase as awareness, education and additional oral entries will grow the oral antiviral market. Finally, we expect Paxlovid to maintain very high share despite additional competitive entries, given its strong benefit-risk profile and brand recognition. So, what does this mean for revenue? As with Comirnaty, we expect 2023 to be a transition year for Paxlovid as well. In 2022, we sold at Pandemic prices more treatment courses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed some time in 2023, probably second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling Paxlovid through the commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect in years 2024 and beyond that the courses sold and used will align closely together within every year. There has been a great deal of speculation regarding the new but uncertain market opportunity for Paxlovid in China, so let me share what we are seeing. We have an agreement with one company to import and distribute Paxlovid in China, local company, and we have a manufacturing agreement with another local Chinese company for local manufacturing. Pfizer shipped only tens of thousands of courses to China in fiscal year 2022. From December, which is the first month of our non-U.S. fiscal year, through March, we expect to ship millions of courses to meet local demand. We expect we will be able to sell effectively under government reimbursement through end of March. And despite China's recent decision not to include Paxlovid on the country's National Drug Reimbursement List, we expect to offer the product on the private market after April 1st unless, of course, a listing opportunity opens up before then. Lastly, I want to point out that while we are expecting increased utilization in all regions of the world as infections increase, we are not including any major new non-U.S. or non-China contracts in our 2023 forecasts. Let me close with a few thoughts regarding our scientific engine. R&D continues to be the lifeblood that fuels us as a company, which is why we plan to increase our R&D spend by at least 8.7% in 2023 to $12.4 billion and $13.4 billion range. In addition to the increased investments, we are taking steps not only to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times, but also to increase overall return on investment and R&D productivity. As you have seen in the last year, we continuously prioritize our pipeline to focus on the assets that represent potential breakthroughs and have the potential for generating higher returns, putting more capital behind larger opportunities like GLP-1, flu, elranatamab, and others. We are at an inflection point to act from a position of strength with our best-in-class R&D productivity, a robust pipeline of innovative assets and one of the highest R&D budgets in the industry. With that, I will turn it over to Dave to provide details on our fourth-quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Take it over, Dave. Thank you, Louise. Clearly, for the ACIP, will depend on the data and it's difficult now to say if preferential could be achieved or not. But for both questions, COVID/flu is mRNA, RSV is not, Mikael, and then also what about the trispecific antibodies? And what about COVID/flu that is mRNA and RSV that it is not mRNA? How do you think about it? Thank you, Mikael. And also to -- as you know, we are mastering multiple technologies in vaccine. So, we are using fit for purpose here. Every time we feel that the technology is appropriate for the problem we're trying to solve, we apply this technology. Flu and COVID, they are -- speed is of essence because there are variants that are coming. So mRNA is ideal position to address this challenge. With RSV, the virus is not changing that often. So, a protein approach that has a brilliant tolerability profile, almost like -- when we saw the data, the responses of the vaccine arm compared to the placebo arm were very difficult to separate, with very, very high efficacy in our case. I think it's the best way to move forward. That's the benefit having multiple approaches and multiple technologies. Next question, please. I'll take the last one and then Angela will answer the European vaccine and the Paxlovid. As you know, the flu vaccine that we are developing, BioNTech also have an economic position into it. And of course, the COVID vaccine, it is a vaccine that we are sharing with them. So, we are not ready to make any comments regarding the economics about the potential COVID and flu vaccine. Angela, what about the European situation and Paxlovid pricing? Thank you, Angela. And also to repeat, I think David has mentioned it already that in our guidance for this year, we factor only a portion of the European contract. So, we spread the volumes into multiple years, although no agreement has been reached yet. Next question, please. Angela? Thank you, Angela. And also to emphasize that the 12 million, calculation is a global number, not a U.S. number. It's a global number. So, I believe the 9 million of IQVIA is approximately in the U.S. And -- but I don't know if they have also estimations for outside the U.S. So, next question, please. I'm sorry for the -- it's a global number, excluding China, well that I mentioned. Next question, please. Of course. First, what is the assumption about the disease because that's a fundamental assumption behind all these projections that we are doing. It is that the disease will continue in the foreseeable future, manifesting clinically the same way that it has the last 6 to 9 months. So there will be mutations and there will be infections over there. And -- but the vaccination rates will be coming down because of lack of compliance but will stabilize to a certain degree of people, but they believe in vaccinations and they feel they are at high risk and they want to make their vaccines. At the same time, the infections were slightly going up because when you have waning immune protection for the population, then you will see more infections are actually more severe infections. So, these are the assumptions that we are using. We are not using assumptions that all the variants will have -- will escape in the protection of the vaccine. But we are using the assumptions that people will be getting 1.3 in the beginning and then going down 1.1, 1.2 doses per year as a normal booster. What was the second question? On the BD, yes, clearly, business development is, by far, one of our biggest priorities, something that I personally take care of and something that we have a very big team screening all the opportunities. I would like to ask Aamir, who is responsible for that area, to make some comments about our priorities. I think we can move to the next question. I would say, Dave, do you want to say how is allocated the growth between in-line, new products and acquired products? It's approximately 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And Angela, what about etrasimod? And because I'm very excited about the product, William, would you like also to add something about it? Sure. That's exactly the point. Best-in-class in an area that it is poorly served right now with current solutions, so we see a lot of opportunity. Let's go to the next question, please. Thank you. DMD, Mikael? As regards the assumptions of our COVID protection vaccines, for example, we are dropping the numbers. So for example, 31% of people receiving a vaccine, that was the actual in \u201822. We are going to \u201824. Then you are reaching a level of really people that they are really committed to the idea of getting vaccinations and they are looked by physicians that don't really believe in the vaccination, the value of vaccinations. We are also dropping the number of doses there. So, we'll go to 1.3. And then eventually, as the years progress, the number of doses that people will receive is small. Keep in mind that to get numbers like 1.2, you need a very, very small percent of population 2 doses, so that you can achieve something like that. Maybe 5% of the population to get a second dose, and then you will go to these numbers, as you will see, if you include also primary doses and children. So, we believe the assumptions are very reasonable with the expectations that COVID will remain as it is right now, so nothing more severe and nothing that will make it less disappearing and we take into consideration that the compliance with the recommendation of the health authorities also because of the fact, will be less. Clearly, pivotal moment will be the introduction of combination vaccines because the convenience of something like that and the fact that people are presenting themselves to receive flu vaccines, given that a combo vaccine would be in the same injection and will cost zero co-pay, likely will become the choice of many to get this full coverage. So, we have quite confidence on these assumptions. And of course, there are only assumptions. We need to wait and see. The other thing, it is -- on the Europe, you asked a few questions. I know that there are rumors, but I don't think that it is appropriate for us to make any comments while we are in negotiation with our partners in Commission and with the member states. So, we only said that we factor on part of the deliveries in this year instead of all the deliveries because we are in the middle of negotiations, but we can't make other comments. Next question, please. A quick one because that's easy, we do not expect \u201824 and \u201825 and beyond to have governmental sales in the U.S. In fact, we think that not even this year, other than some small deliveries that we have still pending with the U.S. government from the -- before, we will not see any U.S. purchases. That's our assumption right now that we will move into a commercial model that will cover all channels as with all other vaccines and products. Margin changes, we haven't said anything yet about Paxlovid. So, I can't comment, if you can calculate. We set there is price, you can calculate the net and then you can make your assumptions on margins. We don't give margins on specific products. Now, a little bit on the lower revenues -- about the revenues ex U.S. Angela, do you want to make any comment on that? Dave? You can predict that, for example, in the first years, \u201821, \u201822 had very high R&D expenses also. We maintain our R&D expense to COVID. Very big part of our expenses in \u201823 is for COVID because we are investing. But you expect over time, those unless if we bring new products that will not be as high as. On the contrary, prices are going up, but margins could improve but also SI&A, promotion expenses are going up, right? So, without wanting to give direction from what it used to be \u201821, \u201822, we expect going forward to be higher, the margins. But all of these equations will be in play. Next question, please. Let me take the first two quickly. Of course, as you saw, the business is going down because of COVID, the average is growing. Expenses are going up because we are promoting new launches, including COVID. So right now, moving into Comirnaty in commercial and Paxlovid with commercial channels, now we treat them like normal promotional products, very sensitive in promotions at the beginning of their launch. So, we are going very hard with promotions, TV, field forces and all the other educational measures that we are taking when we do this type of launch. So there is -- clearly this speaks. What about, David, are we going to buy back? And Mohit also, you asked also about the synergies. Clearly, there are a lot of synergies right now both. In the Paxlovid -- Paxlovid is covered by a lot of physicians, and we have very, very strong primary care field force and we have very strong also vaccines field force that is covering all these physicians that we have, either vaccinate or prescribing Paxlovid. So, clearly, a lot of synergies in retail and in the medical profession also. Let's go to the next call, please. Thank you very much, Chris. To this scientific question to Mikael, first. Thank you. And, of course, Dave will say, but right now, this is the profile that we are targeting. And we think it's easy to do it with two viruses, so to load enough so that we have very good efficacy and good tolerability profile. We believe it will be more challenging, but of course, needs to be seen. And that's why we believe that our RSV -- protein and having such a good tolerability profile offers better combination of a triplet than triplet all with mRNA. Dave, also there was this question that I think you touched upon it earlier in your script about how we see going forward, the expenses of SI&A. David, very good questions. Let me try to explain a little bit. First of all, it's not 12% going to 22%. It's really 17% going to 22%, right? The 12% which is in \u201822,it is a partial year, so it didn't include the full year. The real demand, it is, let's say, \u201823 full year, it is 17%. And it's going up because of two factors: one, it is a small increase in infections. And as I explained, the assumption is that COVID will not disappear, will be there. But vaccine rates, vaccinations are going down. So that will create -- will wane the protection -- the protection of the population. And that will manifest with a small increase, which you factor, 2% based on our modeling, a small increase of both the infections and eventually also the severity. So, that's one. So, the second is that the more introductions of new entries rightly will not happen before \u201825 -- \u201824, \u201825 in the U.S. at least. Will depend if EUA will still be available, which will depend if we will be in a state of emergency or not for EUA. But if we will not be in a state of emergency, which could be like a scenario, there will be no EUAs, we don't see, in \u201824, any introduction, actually we see in \u201825 the introductions. The introductions though, also, as always, are increasing the overall cost. So, fact, it's what also is driving. We are dropping markets share but we are increasing the volume. The last is are we dropping the market share aggressively enough or are we, let's say, very optimistic in dropping. The assumption here it is that we are the only one, we have right now for years presence in the market with a label that is extremely strong with 86% clinical efficacy against hospitalization and against deaths -- high action against deaths. So, it's very difficult for anyone to reproduce this data right now, The studies will run forever likely and will be very large. So, very, very difficult to reproduce something like that. So as a result, given that for years, we will be among -- we will be basically the lion market share, plus the excellent profile, the loyalty that will be developed. All of that are telling us that it is very reasonable with -- to maintain very high market share, you can see that in first-in-class and it's in every treatment, from cancer to that compared to the second and third, it's easy to maintain 60%, 70% of the relevant conditions. Now that we have all these advantages, we think maintaining at 70%, 75%, I think, is reasonable. Of course, we'll have to see. Next question, please. Thank you. Angela? Yes, the payers -- what is the reaction with the vaccine or... Thank you. Maybe I try myself quickly because we're running out of time. If there is an end of emergency, we don't think that will have any impact on current in U.S., will have an impact on issuing new in U.S. I don't think that anything changes in the way that -- emergency or not, whether the inventories will be managed or the access that patients will have in any of these treatments. Now, as regards of COVID/flu, if the introduction of combination for products would change the flu market, I think, yes -- well, would say it's a major flu market was always a single market until now. And suddenly, there is a chance that other respiratory cases like COVID or RSV will come. So I think that would change. But now, the step-up, it is clear we expect that around 24%, 25%, it is a population in the U.S., that believes needs protection and is diligent enough -- not believes, more belief, but they are diligent enough to follow the recommendation and go and get their annual booster for COVID. When they will present themselves -- excuse me, when the flu people will present themselves and they will be asked that question, if you want flu single or flu with a combo, and they will be given the information that will protect them in a single injection at the same time, zero co-pay, for COVID as well, we believe it's reasonable to expect that the 25% stable will become 30%, so we'll add another 5% of the population. And that over time, that will move closer to the 50%, we project 40 over there. So, those are the assumptions that we're using. Next question, please. Mikael? Right. And there was a question on reinvestment of RSV question I think. Yes. I think it will impact ACIP recommendation in vaccines. Once you have ACIP recommendation or not, you're getting automatic actions with all formularies without co-pay. So, that, I think it will be the key what ACIP will say. And let's go to the next question, please. Andrew, the first one is simple, I don't know if the pharmacist will. It's very unlikely, I think. But I don't know, we don't have it in our assumptions right now. And let's go to Mikael. Aamir, you want to add something here? Thank you. Now, let's move to the last question. Aamir, why don't you take this one? Thank you, Aamir. So, thank you, operator. In summary, let me close by saying, first of all, I feel extremely proud for the team at Pfizer that was able to deliver -- break all records in 2022, the highest-ever revenue, the highest-ever profits, the highest, more importantly ever number of patients, that we protected or treated with our medicines. The best-ever reputation for our company, the most productive wave of R&D with 18 -- 19 products launching in the next 18 months, the best R&D machine in terms of multiple measures, all of that were able to achieve in 2022. Clearly though, I believe that the best years of Pfizer are ahead because we are building on a significant capital position that we know how to deploy to create growth. We are building on an R&D engine that it is more productive than ever in the history of this company, a manufacturing engine that it is the envy of the industry, commercial envy -- commercial engine that it is around again and again and again as the best commercial engine in the industry. And, of course, a mindset in Pfizer that is characterized but nothing is impossible. We can make everything possible. So with that in mind, I think that we are moving ahead, hopefully, to an even more successful 2023. Thank you very much for your attention, your interest in us and your support as shareholders. Thank you."

            "name": "Dave Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. Albert has already taken you through many of the key drivers of our full-year performance, so I will focus my opening remarks on some key highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 13% operationally, primarily driven by Comirnaty's strong growth in developed markets following the slowdown in deliveries that we discussed in the third quarter ahead of the rollout of the bivalent booster. We also saw very strong performances from Paxlovid outside the U.S. and the ongoing launch of Prevnar 20 for adults within the U.S. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to our COVID-19 products, Pfizer's revenues grew 5% operationally in the quarter, and if recently acquired products from Biohaven and GBT are also excluded, revenues were up approximately 3% in Q4. Reported diluted EPS this quarter grew by 48% to $0.87, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 69% on an operational basis in the quarter. Both EPS figures include a $0.32 benefit from lower acquired IPR&D expenses compared to last year's fourth quarter. Once again in the quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing fourth quarter revenues by approximately $2.5 billion, or 11%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19, or 24%, compared to LY. On a full-year basis, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $5.5 billion, or 7%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.36, or 9%. Turning now to 2023 and the financial outlook for the Company. Let me first point out that our approach to guidance in 2023 is fundamentally different than prior years. Given the expected transition to commercial markets for our COVID franchise, and away from an Advanced Purchase Agreement environment, our guidance reflects our best estimates for revenues and profits for these products for the full year, not just what has been contractually secured. On a total company basis, we expect revenues of between $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect that revenues from our business excluding COVID will grow between 7% and 9% on an operational basis in 2023. That growth is projected to be split between contributions from our new product launches, our recently acquired products, as well as our in-line portfolio. The total company revenue declines are entirely driven by our COVID products, which are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially returning to growth in 2024 and beyond. While patient demand for our COVID products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected to be fulfilled by products that were delivered to governments in 2022 and recorded as revenues last year. I want to point out that our total company revenue guidance range is wider than what is implied by the 7% to 9% operational growth rate range for the business excluding COVID. The wider guidance range reflects the potential volatility that we see in our COVID product revenues, given that they can be significantly impacted by factors outside of our control, such as the infection rates and the severity of the virus, as well as the timing for transitioning to a traditional commercial model here in the U.S. Now, you can see on this slide our cost and expense guidance for 2023. As I mentioned in my remarks at our investor event in December, both SI&A and R&D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus 2022, despite the fact that our overall revenues are coming down. Higher investments in SI&A are significantly focused on the successful launches of the large number of potential new products that Albert highlighted, as well as recently acquired assets. Additionally, the expected commercial launch of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will require additional investments as we transition away from the government market. These investments are squarely focused on supporting the Company's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. We also intend to invest significantly into our research efforts this year, with multiple exciting and potentially high-value programs receiving additional funding, including our oral GLP-1 programs, elranatamab, and respiratory combination vaccines. All of this spending to support our commercial and research activities, we believe, will not only yield an attractive return, but will also contribute toward setting us on a path to achieve our long-term growth goals. I'll point out that when you exclude revenues and expenses related to COVID products, our expected operating margin profile this year is largely consistent with the prior year. This reflects incremental investments in SI&A related to launch products and R&D, as well as lower acquired IPR&D. In 2023, we are investing in both R&D and SI&A in advance of revenue contributions from new products. Looking longer-term, we expect this spending will be maintained, with the P&L growing into this cost base as new product revenues begin to be fully realized, with margins improving as a result. Given that 2023 is both a year of investment and transition, I thought it would be helpful to outline many of our key assumptions built into our guidance. I don't intend to walk you through all the elements here, but both slides 19 and 20 outline many of the details. In summary, these assumptions include: strong revenue growth of 7 to 9% in our business excluding COVID products; additional investments in SI&A and R&D to support Pfizer's near- and longer-term growth plans; continued patient demand for our COVID-related products worldwide, with vaccination rates declining slightly and utilization of treatments slightly increasing; rephasing of the European Commission Comirnaty contract over multiple years versus full delivery in 2023; and, finally, U.S. commercialization of the COVID products in the second half of 2023. In summary, as we enter a new year, our business is extremely strong, with many in-line, acquired and expected launch products capable of driving strong growth with an attractive pipeline of potential products coming in the future. We believe 2023 will be an important year for Pfizer, and that is why we are deploying our resources into quality execution in order to fully realize the growth opportunities we see within our portfolio and pipeline, which have the potential to impact our growth outlook through 2030 and beyond. So, with that, let me turn it over to Mikael. Yes, a really good question. I think if you look at each one -- each of those 3 buckets, we see growth from acquired products, we see acquired from new products and importantly, we see growth in our in-line portfolio as well. We do not anticipate nor do we see a slowdown in that perspective. Yes. So on -- maybe on the COVID franchise, obviously, we don't give profitability for each product. But you can imagine, as we stated before, on the vaccine, we split our gross margin with BioNTech. So therefore, that would obviously carry a lower profitability mix compared to a typical product. And Paxlovid is probably the opposite in the sense that we share that -- the economics of that fully. So, that's probably a bit on the larger -- higher margin side in general. I think as we look at capital allocation at this point in time, we actually see a lot of opportunities to invest back into our business, both from a research perspective and importantly, getting behind our launches to make sure that we're doing all that we can to ensure that our growth trajectory in \u201825 and \u201830 and those goals and aspirations become reality. So, I think our best and highest use of capital right now is investing in our business, both internally as well as from a BD perspective. I would say never say never to an incremental share repurchase, but that's not high on the priority list at this point. Yes. So importantly, 2023, we're seeing a step-up in SI&A and it's really, again, investments around the launches and the products that have been acquired, which we think are really important to really drive growth in the back half of the decade. So, we're already focused on that. We do think \u201823 is probably the big year of step-up from expenses. And then post \u201823, those expenses will grow more moderately after that. Yes. I think, Kerry, you asked the second season durability data, how that will impact reimbursement discussions..."

            "name": "Aamir Malik",
            "content": "So, Geoff, specifically to your question, you heard Albert described, we set this aspiration goal of $25 billion in 2030 from BD. We're over 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion of that number through the deals that we've done. And we feel very confident that we've got the financial flexibility on the balance sheet and the firepower to complete what we need to, to achieve that goal. And we're going to continue to be disciplined about how we pursue that. The only quick thing I will add, Andrew, is if you look at how prolific our R&D engine has been, the total funding demand from all of the R&D programs that were generated would significantly exceed what we guided to as our R&D spending in \u201822 and \u201823. So, in that context, we are going to be very thoughtful about how we prioritize. We have a robust process for that. And consequently, from time to time, you're going to see programs like the TL1A that have very clear scientific merit, but we think we're sharing the cost, the risk and capabilities with the partner is the best way to create value. And that's what we did in that situation. And we've had a long history of doing that in a number of other situations as well. Sure. The Biohaven deal for us represented an excellent opportunity to leverage our capabilities. And specifically, where were capabilities in terms of our global commercial footprint, that Biohaven as a company alone could not maximize but where application of those capabilities could take Nurtec and the follow-on product to places and reach us for patients that they couldn't have gotten to alone. And also the way in which we structured that transaction, began with an ex U.S. partnership, which we then expanded to take on the full global CGRP franchise and also excluded some assets that were less relevant to us strategically that created a newco. And I think what you can take away from that is that we're going to continue to look for things that are scientific breakthroughs where we can add capabilities and we're also going to be creative and disciplined about how we structure our deals. And we think that's going to serve us well as we complete our ambition against our $25 billion goal."

            "name": "Dr. Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Today, I want to set the stage for an anticipated catalyst-rich 18 months. As Albert mentioned, we are in a position of unprecedented strength in our history and I'm excited to share a high-level overview of an evolved strategy for Pfizer R&D to focus our resources on transformative programs which could be most impactful for patients, drive improved return on R&D investment and create the most value. We will leverage and continue to innovate our powerhouse capabilities in medicine design, and continue to innovate light-speed drug development to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times. We have rethought our approach to rare disease and will move from having a standalone research unit to aligning key programs with other therapeutic areas. We plan to externally advance rare disease programs that do not fit into a core therapeutic area of focus. At the same time, we plan to tap into the expanding external innovation ecosystem by actively pursuing biotech innovation and emerging innovation that fits strategically and accessing external assets that are differentiated. Taken together we believe these actions will help position us to lead the industry in reaching more patients with the most impactful near-term blockbuster breakthroughs while driving forward the next wave of innovations. I'm pleased to share some examples with you today. We are pursuing potentially transformative efficacy in our inflammation & immunology franchise, with the potential launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, which both have the potential to be blockbusters, and a planned Phase 3 study start of anti-interferon Beta in dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Our next wave of innovation includes two monoclonal antibody candidates for atopic dermatitis which exemplify our multispecific platform and in-house biomedicine design expertise. Two assets currently in Phase 1 clinical trials each target three cytokines in a single therapeutic, so we refer to them as trispecifics. On the right are Phase 1 pharmacokinetic profiles of the average plasma concentration. For both molecules, the profiles suggest that once-a-month, or even less frequent, subcutaneous dosing may be supported. There is potential for improved efficacy with more potent interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 neutralization plus an expanded breadth of efficacy by blocking Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin to potentially cover more endotypes, or by blocking interleukin 33 (sic) [interleukin 33] to potentially enhance itch reduction. The Phase 1 studies continue. We aim to bolster our 30-year experience in hematology with a strong pipeline that complements our in-line portfolio and collectively has blockbuster potential. I will talk more about elranatamab and GBT-601 in a moment, so will highlight here that we expect multiple data readouts for TTI-622 in hematological malignancies, two Phase 3 readouts for inclacumab in sickle cell disease in the second half of 2024 and a Phase 3 readout for marstacimab in patients with hemophilia A or B in the second quarter of 2023. Marstacimab has FDA Fast Track designation for both, hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. If successful, we project submitting for the non-inhibitor indication in both A and B hemophilia in the third quarter of 2023. We recently announced positive top-line results from a Phase 3 study of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate and expect a pivotal readout for our hemophilia A gene therapy in the first half of 2024. We recently presented strong updated Phase 2 data on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, CD3-targeted bispecific antibody, for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in heavily pre-treated patients who had received at least three classes of prior therapies. This candidate, which has the potential to be a leader in the BCMA bi-specific class, demonstrated a high objective response rate of 61% in patients with no prior BCMA-targeted treatment, early and deep responses, and a manageable safety profile. Given factors currently limiting the availability of novel therapies in the triple-class exposed setting, elranatamab has the potential to reach a broader and greater number of patients as an off-the-shelf option with reduced dosing frequency that is administered subcutaneously, offering more convenience than intravenous administration. With FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted last year, elranatamab could potentially be approved this year. As there is blockbuster potential and patient value beyond the triple-class refractory population, our clinical strategy aims to move to earlier lines of therapy and combination approaches with the potential, if successful, for multiple approvals to expand eligibility and duration of therapy. Now, to our next generation oral, once-daily, hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor candidate that's in a unique class and has the potential to expand the prophylactic treatment of people with sickle cell disease. Standard-of-care treatment rates have typically been low due to side effects, poor efficacy, or both. While Oxbryta made substantial progress in preventing hemoglobin polymerization, or sickling, GBT-601 is a potentially best-in-class candidate which may improve both hemolysis and frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. The most recent data from our Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study showed improvements in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels over time, mean hemoglobin occupancy of more than 32% for the 100 milligram maintenance dose and more than 41% for the 150 milligram maintenance dose, and improvements in red blood cell health with the higher maintenance doses. The maintenance doses were well tolerated. We believe these results may be transformative for patients, with a potential to achieve 35% to 45% hemoglobin occupancy, which is considered optimal for both hemoglobin oxygen affinity and preventing sickling, and approaches levels seen with gene therapies. This asset is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 study with a seamless Phase 2/3 design. We plan to start the Phase 3 part in the second half of 2023. Next, we aim to expand our leadership in breast cancer with a pipeline of complementary next-wave candidates. Our CDK4 inhibitor targets improving on CDK4/6 inhibition standard of care by maximizing CDK4 coverage. We are studying it in Phase 1 in hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer as a single agent and in combination with endocrine therapy. The majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia that requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition, and that complete CDK4 inhibition by CDK4/6 inhibitors is challenging due to dose-limiting hematological adverse events. In the Phase 1 combination study, the confirmed objective response rate in combination with fulvestrant or letrozole reached nearly 30% and the clinical benefit rate was approximately 50% in 21 patients with measurable disease. The median progression-free survival was more than 24 weeks in 26 patients including 5 without measurable disease. All participants were heavily pre-treated with a median of four lines of prior treatment. All patients received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment and 67% received prior fulvestrant. The asset was well tolerated with CDK4 drug showing only 15% Grade 3 neutropenia and no Grade 4. Here, we show a scan of a patient who achieved partial response and was on treatment for 47 weeks. She had received six lines of prior treatment, including CDK4/6 inhibition and fulvestrant. We are currently engaged in dose optimization, enrolling CDK4/6-nai\u0308ve cohorts, and planning to start a randomized study in second-line treatment of estrogen receptor positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer this year. Additional data readouts from our next wave of breast cancer candidates are anticipated in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we anticipate multiple milestones over the next 18 months. We expect a pivotal IBRANCE readout in hormone receptor positive/HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, a pivotal study start for ARV-471 and a Phase 2 readout for our KAT6 inhibitor. We have achieved incredible advancement in our vaccines portfolio, including candidates that harness our leadership in mRNA, with an unprecedented number of milestones expected. In addition to the expected launches shown here, we expect a Phase 3 data readout from our modRNA flu candidate vaccine, and a potential respiratory combination vaccine study start. A Phase 1/2 study of our shingles candidate, the first mRNA-based shingles vaccine program, began last week. In inflammation & immunology as well as internal medicine, key catalysts include potential launches of potential blockbusters, a planned pivotal study start with anti-interferon Beta and data readouts in metabolic disease. We're also making good progress in our anti-infectives portfolio, including anticipating full approval for Paxlovid, and planned study starts for both our second-generation COVID-19 antiviral candidate, which may have no or limited drug-drug interactions, and our RSV antiviral candidate. In closing, we are very optimistic about the many transformative catalysts emerging from the pipeline. Pfizer scientists are working with urgency and commitment to help the most patients as quickly as we can. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. So, as Albert spoke about Cibinqo's expansion, we think there's room for many opportunities in atopic dermatitis. We wanted to highlight this as a really novel pioneering approach to go beyond the current antibodies in atopic dermatitis with potentially many other allergic diseases. But there is room for several products in our pipeline in both oral and topical segment, as you mentioned. So, this is an area, I think, we will excel in. Well, I think it actually offers an opportunity when you have the breadth to have a pipeline with different platforms. We think that the COVID/flu, which contains six components, and we have made a real good progress in enrolling the study in which start to share data in the near future has, by itself, of course, a Fast Track forward pending data. But for the use of a potential triple vaccine, rather than adding up more and more mRNA with the current technology that we have seen can lead to ritlecitinib limitation and less tolerability, we think this flexibility to add on a protein may give you the perfect balance between efficacy and tolerability. We continue to be enthusiastic about gene therapy in DMD. I think we have actually published the strongest data on the two drugs with efficacy as well as a lot of biomarkers from our Phase 1 across a much broader age group than anyone else. And I can't comment when possibly someone else will get it registered. But, we expect data readouts within possibly less than a year. And we think that this could be a very important drug. And we will have randomized data, which is not the case for any other application currently to have at that size and scope. Yes. We think that the tolerability will be well on par with vaccines used in the target population and be perceived as tolerable and convenient. As you described, the combination will attract the high volume of flu people to also be able in shot to renew the COVID coverage, particularly with more and more variants coming. So we're very positive and think we're right in the balance of those and opportunity there. Yes. I mean, we always follow multi-seasonal vaccines and we'll share the second season data as soon as it's available. Of course, there are many ways this can play out with combination vaccines and which could lead to more regular vaccination rather than protracted. And on -- you also asked about the, let's say, the flu/COVID combo here. So if we need a full Phase 3, if we have both flu and COVID? We expect that you need a Phase 3 that is based on immunogenicity and safety and not a large trial based on events. So, we think we can complete that fast. And if anyone can do it first, it's we. So, that's very high on our list currently pending data to move with light speed in. I'll start with, Andrew, great question. You touched my heart today. We have cracked it. These antibodies that I shared today have, first of all, pharmacokinetics like an excellent single antibody but 3-in-1 product and have very high potency, which you asked about, actually exceeding the marketed product substantially. So, we think it's really something that we will move very quickly as we learn more of it. And you asked about TL1A. We think we have a very good partnership with Roivant that helps us to do more things within our pipeline. And you've heard Aamir Malik earlier alluded to that we have commercialization rights ex U.S., Japan. We have about half of the value of this product. And we have a follow-on bispecific TL1A p40 that's active mechanism of STELARA. So, we think we have such a richness in this space and really enjoy to build the ecosystem with others and maximize what we bring to patients."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "So, for Comirnaty in Europe, as you know, this was a multiyear contract that we entered into with the Commission and the member states. And so I think the pricing there is what it is for the contract. And we're in discussions with the European Commission regarding \u201823 and what the deliveries will look like. Specifically for Pax, I think that was your next question, that is going commercial only later in this year. So, we are now preparing what those pricing scenarios could look like, and we'll share more at the right time. Well, let's start with the U.S. Paxlovid. So, in 2022, when we launched Paxlovid, we -- the first quarter of Paxlovid, the first quarter post launch, we did not really have sufficient supply because we were still ramping up. So, the total number of doses that were used in the U.S. for Paxlovid is actually less than the demand. So, that's why you see -- we used about 8.6 million, 8.9 million doses in the U.S. when actually demand was much more than that. Then you asked a question about IQVIA, the difference. As you know, IQVIA doesn't capture all the channels, so you're not going to see an exact match. But I think that in general for 2023, the number of doses that you will see for the U.S. and for ex U.S. is just going to be a function of the contracts that were made, the deliveries that we have to make in each of the countries and also the timing of the commercialization. And it just looks different in every single country. I think we're really excited about etrasimod as a new entry you see. It's a market that has been heavily dominated by biologics and then followed by of these JAKs after the biologics. But really, in the earlier treatment positions, there really hasn't been much innovation, and that's where we see etrasimod fitting in. I think the safety profile of etrasimod and its efficacy allows it to be used very well as an agent prior to the use of biologics. And that's where we see the ability to tap into a new segment and to grow. Sure. As you said, there were some specific reasons for why we saw what we saw for Eliquis, IBRANCE, PCV. I mean, Eliquis specifically was the loss of exclusivity and our patent challenges that led to some generic increase at risk in both the U.K. and Netherlands. I mean, IBRANCE is a mature product. And so, it goes through sort of the reimbursement and the sort of the pricing regulation that it typically goes through in Europe. And I think PCV in general, what we're seeing is that, at least on the kid side, not on the adult side, but on the kid side, vaccinations are still -- are not back up to where they are where it was prior to the pandemic. So, I think in all three cases, there were very specific reasons for what you saw. And we don't anticipate anything extraordinary or different in 2023. I think it's sort of business as usual. So I think for Paxlovid, again, the time period, the way to think about it is in two time periods from now until April, which is a reimbursed market, which gives us access to both public as well as private channels, and then after April, private channels only. As you heard, we have included in sour guidance what we believe we can do in the first three months of this year. But given the fact that the back half of the year, we will -- it's going to be highly uncertain. It will be a very dynamic market. We'll continue to make sure that we have supply, but we'll have to just wait and see what happens there. On the side of U.S., similarly, we will be transitioning this year. We will have a year where some of the revenue will be made through the completion of contracts that we made with the U.S. government in 2022. And then part of the year, the revenues will come from the commercialization of Paxlovid. So, you're going to see that play through -- both of those dynamics play through. And then I think you had one more question. Yes. So it's still early days, especially in the U.S., right, because that's only happening middle of the year. But what I can say is that we have had some early discussions already with agencies and reimbursement agencies outside of the U.S. who have given us, I guess, earlier feedback. And even if you take a country like the U.K., we actually had very favorable feedback on the pricing that we provided, and they agreed with the cost effectiveness of our Paxlovid. So I think we'll -- obviously, that's good feedback, and we'll be taking those learnings and those value arguments to multiple countries around the world."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChristopher Stevo: Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's third quarter earnings call. We anticipate that this call will last 60 minutes. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.  Before we begin the call, I'm also happy to announce that we will host an Analyst Day in New York City on the afternoon of December 12. Members of our executive team and other leaders of Pfizer will share information on our rich slate of potential near-term product launches and the R&D readouts which will drive the next wave of product launches after that, both of which will support our 2030 revenues and beyond. In-person attendance will be by invitation, but we will also be webcasting the event. While we're not going to talk more about the agenda today, we look forward to providing more details as we get closer to December 12.  Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 4. And additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.  With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will briefly touch on some recent highlights. I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve.  In addition to generating a stellar financial performance, since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination of treatment of TALZENNA and XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate for adolescents and young adults, as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity.  Just this morning, we announced positive top line data from the Phase III clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth.  We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on 3 broad therapeutic areas: primary care, specialty care and oncology. We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several potential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years.  We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a Phase III study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a Phase I study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one shot.  We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively.  Less than 6 months ago after launching An Accord for a Healthier World, a breakthrough initiative designed to close the health equity gap for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products have arrived to these countries, and we are working with governments on health system improvements that can help make sure these products reach those in need.  And of course, we continue to lead the fight against COVID-19. Most notably, our Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency and several other regulatory bodies. And as part of Pfizer's commitment to providing equitable access to COVID-19 oral treatments, we agreed to supply at a not-for-profit price up to 6 million PAXLOVID treatment courses to the Global Fund for low and lower middle income countries.  An exciting quarter, for sure. But in our company and our industry, it's all about what's next. The next breakthrough medicine or vaccine, the next game-changing, the next solution to an unmet patient need. This continued pursuit of what's next is embedded in Pfizer's DNA and the foundational driver of our purpose: breakthroughs that change patients' lives. It's also why we have confidence that Pfizer's story is a story of growth.  We recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer-term growth projects, particularly in the '25 to '30 time frame. That's understandable given that we currently expect a negative impact of approximately $17 billion in revenues from losses of exclusivity during that period based on our internal calculations. We believe we not only can overcome these expected declines, but also can potentially generate strong growth through the end of the decade.  Let's take a closer look on how we expect to accomplish this. Our strong capital position has given us the ability to pursue business development opportunities with the potential, if successful, of course, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top line expectations.  We believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 1/3 of the way there and that we have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target.  Perhaps even more exciting is the wave of potential growth drivers emerging from our R&D pipeline in the near term. Over the next 18 months, we expect to have up to 19 new products or indications in the market, including the 5 for which we have already begun co-promotions or commercialization earlier this year. We can find -- you can find the list of these launches in the appendix of the presentation we posted today for this earnings call.  If successful, these 19 launches, of which more than 2/3 have the potential to be blockbusters, will be the most ever in Pfizer's history. The 15 in-house-developed projects alone could potentially represent approximately $20 billion in 2030 sales, which would more than offset the expected LOE impact.  Many of these programs are already largely de-risked from a clinical perspective. The majority of them were discovered in-house and nearly all of them would be for indications outside of COVID-19. If approved, we expect each of these to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.  And of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the '24 to '30 time line. These include gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our oral GLP-1 for diabetes and obesity; a potential combo vaccine that would cover flu and COVID in one shot and many, many more.  With regard to our COVID-19 products, while their sales may fall from our expected 2022 levels of approximately combined $55 billion, we believe our COVID-19 franchises will remain multibillion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future which should serve as a buffer for any unforeseen challenges with other products in our portfolio.  Our confidence to execute this plan stems from the depth of our financial resources and the firepower it gives us to pursue business development opportunities, the powerful brand equity we have built up over the past 170 years and further enhanced in the past 2 years. According to a recent survey, our brand awareness now stands at an impressive 82% and our favorability stands at 61% compared with 42% for the industry as a whole, results that were obtained just a couple of months ago. And of course, the strength of the 3 foundational pillars of our company, our world-class scientific, our world-class commercial and our world-class manufacturing engines, and you will see on this slide some highlights of each one of them.  Let me now briefly highlight 3 potential blockbusters that we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. RSV is an area of significant unmet need, particularly in older adults and infants. Each year, it is estimated more than 177,000 older adults are hospitalized and 14,000 of them die in the U.S. alone due to RSV that is confirmed by a diagnostic test. We believe we have the potential to be a leader in this space and have a real impact on public health.  On March 24 of this year, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our RSV vaccine candidate for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. We are excited to report positive top line data from the Phase III RENOIR trial in late August, with the recent presentation of detailed results at IDWeek 22.  A preplanned interim analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 67% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, defined by 2 or more symptoms. And vaccine efficacy of 85.7% was observed in participants with more severe disease, presenting 3 or more RSV-associated symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness.  We are also excited about the potential for our maternal RSV vaccine candidate. Globally, each year, RSV sickens more than 6.5 million infants under 6 months old and kills approximately 45,000. As announced this morning, our maternal RSV study met the success criterion for 1 of the 2 primary endpoints. Vaccine efficacy of 81.8% was observed against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life. And high efficacy of 69.4% was demonstrated through the first 6 months of life.  So there is the potential that, subject to regulatory approval, by late 2023, early 2024, we could have the only RSV maternal vaccine in the market, along with an RSV vaccine for older adults, that has high efficacy, and it is well tolerated with no safety concerns.  Combined, the 2 indications represent a potential multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity if approved, especially with our highly respected primary care sales force executing these launches. Including the RSV antiviral investigational candidates we acquired with ReViral, we aim to have end-to-end solutions with both preventative vaccines and therapeutics to treat those infected with RSV.  Ulcerative colitis or UC is a chronic and often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that affects an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Many patients living with this disease never achieve or maintain remission, and physicians are seeking effective, proven oral therapies with a favorable benefit/risk profile that can be an attractive first-line advanced therapy option. As a result, we expect the market opportunity to grow by about 50% over the next 5 years.  The positive Phase III data from the ELEVATE UC 12 and 52 trials reinforce our belief that etrasimod has a differentiated clinical profile and can be an important treatment option if approved. We believe that etrasimod can be a multibillion-dollar blockbuster product. We expect to launch the product in the U.S. as soon as the second half of 2023, pending regulatory approval, through our specialty care sales force, which already has strong relationships in the UC market, thanks to its work with Xeljanz, biosimilars, et cetera.  Lastly, let's look at migraine. Following our acquisition of Biohaven in early October, we are now aiming to build the world's leading global migraine franchise with the potential to impact 1 billion patients around the world. Migraine is a debilitating disease and has 11.6% prevalence worldwide. In the U.S. alone, there are 40 million patients with migraine, and 1 out of 5 women are migraine sufferers right now. The economic burden is significant at $36 billion per year. We believe our portfolio, including NURTEC ODT, VYDURA and zavegepant, could meet a range of needs in the market, allowing physicians and patients to decide how to appropriately manage migraine treatment and prevention. As a result, we see the potential to reach more than $6 billion in peak revenues altogether.  In the U.S., NURTEC is growing very well, including the impact of Pfizer's co-promoting, which began in August pre-close. NURTEC has further strengthened its #1 market share position in the oral CGRP market, and we expect even stronger growth as we deliver on our promise to further enhance our commercial efforts behind this program.  Outside the U.S., it has been approved in the EU, U.K., Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and we have filed for registration in an additional 10 markets. While this is not a new product launch, we believe this is a great example of how we can take this portfolio to new heights by leveraging the full strength of Pfizer's global commercial engine, including in primary care physicians.  Moving over to zavegepant. We recently expect to launch zavegepant intranasal in the U.S. next year, pending FDA approval, and we plan to globally commercialize. Lastly, the oral prevention Phase III trial is ongoing with a data readout expected in the third quarter.  So with that, I turn it over to Dave to update you on the results and outlook for the financials. After Dave, Mikael will speak about the progression of our pipeline.\nDavid Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns. As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities has expanded significantly over the past several years and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever.  During the first 9 months of 2022, the company has deployed and committed capital in 3 main areas: first, we've invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D as we continue to support our growing pipeline of innovative medicines. These investments are squarely focused on driving revenue growth through 2030.  Secondly, in the first 3 quarters of this year, we have invested approximately $8 billion in completed business transactions. Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, the company completed investments of more than $18 billion in transactions, including both Biohaven and GBT, which brings us to approximately $26 billion in capital deployed for business development transactions thus far in 2022 alone. These transactions illustrate our progress towards the goal of adding $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenues through BD.  And finally, we have returned nearly $9 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of both dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital allocation will continue to be a major focus for Pfizer. So with that, let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I'll limit my remarks largely to adjusted and operating growth figures.  Third quarter revenues demonstrated strength across many areas of the business, but much of that strength was somewhat obscured by our incredibly strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Given the strength in the prior year, revenues this quarter decreased 2% operationally. However, looking at it on a 2-year basis, revenues this quarter were up more than 120% compared to the third quarter of 2020. The slight decrease compared to last year was in line with our expectations given the phasing of scheduled deliveries of COMIRNATY, which we discussed in our earnings call last quarter. Also underlying our results this quarter was the strong performance of PAXLOVID as well as continued strength from a number of our other key products.  Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to the COVID products, Pfizer's revenues grew 2% operationally in the quarter. Gross margins expanded by 1,450 basis points versus the third quarter of LY. This improvement is largely due to increased sales of higher-margin PAXLOVID and decreased sales of lower-gross margin COMIRNATY compared to last year. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of a $400 million charge related to excess raw materials for PAXLOVID. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we intentionally chose to order additional stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand if an extreme need were to arise.  Adjusted SI&A expenses in the third quarter grew 23% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY and higher health care reform fees.  The 2% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q3 was primarily driven by increased cost to develop recently acquired assets as well as investments for certain oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines programs. This was partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and various late-stage clinical programs.  The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter was 4.4%, significantly lower than typical, driven by tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning several tax years. Excluding these tax resolutions, the underlying tax rate was consistent with historical trends.  As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.51 grew by 6%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.78 grew 44% on an operational basis in the quarter. Now foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues by approximately $950 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 this quarter.  Now let me move to our updated 2022 guidance. Given our strong third quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for revenues by $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. This operational increase on the bottom line would have been even higher if not for an incremental $0.06 negative impact due to higher acquired IPR&D expenses.  Partially offsetting these operational increases is the impact of additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we last updated guidance in late July. Incremental foreign exchange movements negatively impacted our expectations for 2022 revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $700 million and $0.09, respectively.  The net impact of these cross-currents result in increases to the midpoints of our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges. These revised ranges reflect operational growth rates of 31% for revenues and 70% for adjusted diluted earnings per share at the midpoint compared to 2021. And this was up from our previous operational growth expectations for revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 29% and 65%, respectively. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we now expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $34 billion, up by $2 billion compared to our prior guidance. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance range unchanged despite the negative incremental impact of changes in FX.  You can see on this slide our updated costs and expense guidance which incorporates our performance to date, our recent acquisitions and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year. More information on each of these updates can be found in this morning's press release. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March of 2022.  In closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation.  With that, I'll now turn it over to Mikael.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Dave. Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.  With anchor products such as COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, IBRANCE and XTANDI, we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology and certain cancers. We have deep expertise in these areas, and there is exciting science emerging. I will share updates from 3 of these today: respiratory, metabolic and prostate cancer.  Building on our success with COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, we see enormous potential to help address major causes of respiratory disease through vaccines and therapeutics. Work on the next-generation vaccine candidates are well underway. And last week, we started a Phase I clinical trial of our second-generation oral therapeutic candidate.  Our quadrivalent modRNA flu program has progressed into Phase III, and we will start shortly a Phase I study of an mRNA-based vaccine candidate that combines our quadrivalent modRNA flu vaccine candidate with the Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine based on BA.4/5. In RSV, we believe a dual focus on developing a vaccine and antivirals could make a significant impact globally. I will share new data with you shortly. PAXLOVID continues to be an important tool in helping to combat the impact of COVID-19. And secondary endpoints from the EPIC-High Risk study as well as data from real-world evidence support the product's efficacy profile.  In the EPIC-HR study, PAXLOVID reduced COVID-19-related all-cause deaths and ICU admissions by 100% and COVID-19-related hospitalization by 86% in unvaccinated, high-risk patients compared to placebo. It also reduced the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by 2 to 3 days compared to placebo. We are pleased to see PAXLOVID leading the COVID-19 treatment landscape and remain confident in its safety and efficacy in treating patients at high-risk for severe outcomes.  We recently reported a positive interim analysis from a Phase III study in older adults of our novel RSV vaccine candidate, which targets the prefusion F protein on both RSV A and B, without need for an adjuvant. We saw remarkable vaccine efficacy across the first RSV season. The vaccine was extremely well tolerated with favorable systemic tolerability, a key consideration for vaccines.  We also are developing the RSVpreF vaccine candidate for use in pregnant women so that protection may be conferred to newborns. And this morning, we announced exciting results from a preplanned interim analysis of our Phase III trial. We observed vaccine efficacy of nearly 82% against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness or MA-LRTI due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life and efficacy of more than 69% through the first 6 months of life. Success criterion was not met for the second primary endpoint. However, clinically meaningful efficacy was observed with MA-LRTI of 57% in infant from birth through 90 days of life and efficacy of 51% over the 6-month follow-up period. The Data Monitoring Committee indicated the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns for either vaccinated women or their newborns.  Given these impressive results, we look forward to filing BLA for both older adults and pregnant women with the U.S. FDA by year-end with potential launches in '23. If approved, our maternal RSV vaccine candidate potentially would be the first available to help prevent this common and potentially life-threatening respiratory illness in young infants.  Turning now to prostate cancer. We're building upon the standard of care set by XTANDI in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant population. The Phase III EMBARK study of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to read out first half of '23. And the Phase III TALAPRO-3 study of TALZENNA and XTANDI is expected in '24. These trials may indicate benefit in up to 20% more patients than are currently treated and potentially prolong duration of use, subject to clinical success and regulatory approval.  Now in TALAPRO-2, we observed the first clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor plus XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutation. Irrespective of HRR gene mutation status, the study achieved its primary endpoint. The combination delivered a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival and appears to have resulted in the longest observed such survival in a randomized trial in this setting. We are encouraged by these results and believe that TALZENNA in prostate cancer may have blockbuster potential, subject to regulatory approval.  Turning to metabolic disorders. I previously shared that we are developing 2 oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, danuglipron and 1532. Recently presented Phase Ib data for 1532 show dose-dependent reduction from baseline at 4 to 6 weeks in mean daily glucose, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and body weight. Both candidates are potentially best-in-class and differentiated by offering full agonism, which may be required to achieve the same level of response as injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists while offering a convenient once daily dose for 1532. Glucose effects plateau at lower doses, while body weight effects continue to improve at higher doses.  The planned Phase IIb study will evaluate 1532 versus both oral semaglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes and separately versus placebo in obesity. Using semaglutide as a comparator in the type 2 diabetes arm should allow us to observe potential early signs of differentiation in efficacy, tolerability and safety. We will evaluate doses up to 260 milligrams in this study, higher than the studies in the Phase Ib. We plan to begin dosing soon and anticipate the readout in first quarter 2024.  The ongoing Phase IIb study of danuglipron in obesity with now once-monthly titration is expected to complete second half of 2023. Data from these studies will be available in relatively quick succession and, assuming clinical success, allow us to select one based on efficacy, tolerability and dosing to advance to Phase III in both type 2 diabetes and obesity.  In closing, we are excited about the developing science within these franchisees and share here recent and anticipated milestones in the next 18 months. We look forward to continue our development both for potential patient benefit and sustainable growth.  Thank you. Let me turn over to Chris to start Q&A.\nChristopher Stevo: Thanks, Mikael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We have about 30 minutes for this session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Chelsea, please go ahead and queue up the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. We'll go to our next question, Colin Bristow with UBS.\nColin Bristow: On COVID '23 expectations, should we expect anything from you here on the December 12 Investor event? And then just more broadly around this, how are you thinking conceptually about guiding to this? Will it be similar to last year? Are you thinking of more sort of scenario-based guiding? Anything that would be helpful.  And then just a sort of temperature check on business development, if you could update us on your priorities and interests. And then from a deal perspective, just how big would you be willing to go? Thank you. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. On the December 12, what you should expect, it is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science and the market potential of those launches as well as some of the most important pipeline potential new medicines and vaccines that they are not going to be launched in the next 18 months but will be launched in the period between '24 and '30.  Now for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD.\nAamir Malik: Thanks for the question, Colin. The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before. And principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs. That's going to continue to be our north star. We're looking for deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade. And importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerating our commercial momentum. And if you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022, including Arena, Biohaven, ReViral and GBT, they would all be very consistent with those priorities.  We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction. But you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Aamir. And also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID and are we going to provide it and when for '23, et cetera.\nDavid Denton: Yes. Thank you, Albert. Maybe let me discuss the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise. I think if you look out longer-term, the franchise is going to be a multibillion-dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu. So therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and the therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, are going to be quite relevant for many years to come.  Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year. We will break out that guidance specifically, so you can hold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes.\nOperator: Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So I wanted to ask you, first off, how you think about -- or maybe more color on how you think about the pushes and pulls in 2023. There's a lot of moving parts there. And then secondly, on your RSV franchise, there seems to be several players with drugs in development and they've all reported out positive data. So curious how you think about this market playing out over time?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Let me say a few words about the push and pulls, and then I will ask Angela to complement and then speak about how we see the RSV market.  Clearly, '23 is a very, very important year for us given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months. And most of them will happen in '23 and some beginning of the first quarter of '24. But we are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven and the Global Blood, $20 billion of peak sales were expected 2030 sales we are expecting from those launches. So it's a very, very big number. And it's very important for us to do it well. In addition, so clearly, that will bring -- our non-COVID business will be a significant boost for our non-COVID business.  Now when we move to COVID, we expect '23 will be a transition year with likely in the U.S. moving from a government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics. The timing is not certain. So we are ready to do it ASAP, but we will be phased over the years. And it likely will not be the same for PAXLOVID or COMIRNATY. And clearly also, there will be some stuff that will have to be depleted in '23. And clearly, will be new price dynamics as we are moving to '23. So COVID will be a little bit more of a transitional year in '23 until it will be established into more like a flu volumes type of market. But of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease, that will bring both therapeutic and vaccines into a multibillion-dollars franchise. But we are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our '23 numbers when we will provide guidance.  Now Angela, anything to add on the push and pulls? You are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult.\nAngela Hwang: Well, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. First and foremost, because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right? We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from COMIRNATY.  I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. And it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint. These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal.  Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit. There's 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for this vaccination. It's actually a -- it's quite a devastating disease. The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion. It is also underreported and underdiagnosed. And so we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education and to bring this vaccine to those who need it.  Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease. Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under 6 months old and those that are preterm. And actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from infant infections of RSV. So again, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here. As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines. And so that, coupled with our strength in women's health and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine.  And so bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations. We are also very well versed in our work with the vaccine technical committees around the world, in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is what's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these 2 tremendous breakthroughs. So I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio.\nAlbert Bourla: Very well, Angela, and I agree with you.\nOperator: Next, we have Steve Scala with Cowen.\nStephen Scala: I have three questions, but they're all short. First, what impact on RSV-associated infant hospitalizations did Pfizer see in the Phase III MATISSE trial? Second, can you tell us what NURTEC sales were in Q3? I know you didn't own Biohaven in Q3, but you likely know the number.  And then lastly, all things considered, is it unrealistic to think that COMIRNATY plus PAXLOVID sales could be as much as $15 billion in 2030?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Mikael, what about the RSV data?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you for the question. So as you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data and the 2 separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing. And to our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important. And that was defined as severe, medically attended lower tract respiratory infections, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy. That is defined by clinical features, such as the rate and the stress of respiration, oxygenation levels, et cetera, in the children and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not. We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization. When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalizations. I'm probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering children as appropriately studied in this vaccination. So we're very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of NURTEC in the third quarter, let me make a comment on COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID and the franchise.  Clearly, we said that we will provide us good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year. Now you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging. But also, the way you are asking the question, is it unthinkable -- is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise? Well, taking that it is $55 billion right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030, could be that. But it's not clear that it will be done. So that will depend on the virus and how it behaves. It will depend on if it will become standard practice to vaccinate together with flu. If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction. So I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given that where we are right now.  Now, what about NURTEC sales?\nDavid Denton: Yes. Steve, this is Dave. As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product is performing. If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it was about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume. And then if you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3. So I think this shows the promise of this product, number one.  And number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force and into our primary care field force, we can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the U.S. and abroad.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Great. On PAXLOVID, I was just -- I'm sure you saw the recent publication citing how many people have died from not even getting an antiviral. Can you talk a little bit about the efforts you're making to educate physicians to give the drug? And do you think we'll ever get to a point where people will be more comfortable, doctors will be more comfortable taking it, given all the news around the PAXLOVID rebound? And second question, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for vitiligo and alopecia in your pipeline? And when should we hear the next readout?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela.\nAngela Hwang: Well, thank you for the question. So we can just talk a little bit about PAXLOVID and how that's been going. I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand-in-hand with the U.S. government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public.  The U.S. government and the state governments, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns. And equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of PAXLOVID.  So if you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written PAXLOVID. And what you have in addition to that is education that we've provided not only to doctors but also to pharmacists. We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write PAXLOVID.  And so I think the education is really firing off, both at a prescriber level but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments, to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education.  I will say that the Test to Treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for PAXLOVID.  So I think that it's -- frankly, I think it's going well. I think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall. But the fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this PAXLOVID already is a great indicator of their confidence with this.  And the fact that probably, the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for PAXLOVID. And actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible. And they include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally, risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of. And so I think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall.\nAlbert Bourla: And what about vitiligo?\nAngela Hwang: I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib. I think probably the main theme here is that there are not effective -- there aren't any treatments for these highly -- very serious inflammatory conditions today. So huge unmet need, huge -- just a place where there's just no options today. So the fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market, I think, will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options.\nAlbert Bourla: And William, can you please address a little bit the issue about the rebounds that was also mentioned?\nWilliam Pao: Sure, Albert. Well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of PAXLOVID versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19. And we had additional end points there which we showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients, 100% who got PAXLOVID were DC-ed to home versus 53% placebo. We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in mean days hospitalized versus 100 patients and also a 73% reduction in any COVID-19-related medical visits. Importantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustained time to symptom resolution of an impact of 2 to 3 days of PAXLOVID versus placebo.  But most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually that rebound occurs with COVID, in general. For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients who got placebo with COVID and actually, 1/3 of those had recurrent symptoms after the resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with PAXLOVID.  Importantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful. Whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that you can also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance. So again, PAXLOVID is not associated with resistance but the antibodies are. So we feel very confident that PAXLOVID has a significant impact and a role against COVID.\nOperator: Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions. Firstly, as it relates to maternal RSV vaccine. Could you talk about reimbursement coverage in the U.S.? I'm assuming you'll get an ACIP recommendation. And therefore, there will be 0 out of pocket, which may differentiate it versus the monoclonal. And I'm sure on a cost basis, that will be material.  And then secondly, could you talk to your efforts with your ER degrader with Arvinas in light of the evolving data on SERDs? Thinking about Astra's recent positive trial on MDS subgroup. Do you believe that this is a function of defining the right patient population at the right stage of the disease rather than the potential risk to the development of the entire category?\nAlbert Bourla: Drew, thank you. In the interest of time, let me give the first answer. Yes, you are right. As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this type of efficacy, it will be recommended, there is 0 co-pay irrelevant of the insurance. If it is commercial or if it is public, their obligation is 0 co-pay from the payers, and they have to cover it. Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecules?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you for asking. Clearly, we think that there are 2 factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders. And we think that PROTAC, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in down-regulating the estrogen receptor. And selecting the right patients compared to standard of care, that includes selecting patients that have estrogen receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs and it's related to the property of the drug itself.  We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we had in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4 drug. And that may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and next waves.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Another reason to attend this great event.\nOperator: Next, we have Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: Congrats on the progress. Two questions for me. On BD, I want to be brief here. But can you talk about what other therapeutic areas you might want to explore? I know you're in neurology with Biohaven, nonmalignant hematology with GBT and, of course, inflammation. Would you consider adding oncology?  And on the same line, kind of, Albert, in some previous comments ahead of this call, you had mentioned going alone with some of your mRNA technologies. What applications of mRNA do you see outside of COVID? I mean this personalized cancer vaccine is an area that you would explore.\nAlbert Bourla: Maybe I'll pass that to Aamir.\nAamir Malik: Sure. Evan, thanks for the question. As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science. And the good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas. So you've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, I&I and, certainly, oncology. And our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it. And we feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different TAs.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Aamir. Yes, we didn't answer the mRNA and how we think about it, Mikael.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. So I'm excited to share we're broadening that platform. You heard about advance of the mRNA flu vaccine successfully to the next stages. Albert mentioned plans that are ongoing to combine it with COVID vaccine to build more broader respiratory vaccine with indeed improved convenience in single administration, single-patient visits.  We are on our way to the Phase I study, together with BioNTech, on our shingles vaccine that really aim to deliver the power of the mRNA, but remove what we've seen as a pretty significant issue with of the current adjuvant vaccine.  We're looking at several other mRNA vaccine that we will share in proper time. But also, that Aamir briefly alluded to, we have made progress in our alliance with Beam to really identify the first type of candidates that will move forward to genetic medicine in some of the important rare diseases. And we're looking at application at certain areas of in vivo cancer medications, where we think this technology can be more successful where compared to the past of cancer vaccines.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Mikael.\nOperator: Next is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: So on RSV vaccine side, I mean -- so the congress on the data in maternal vaccine, my question is Sanofi has an antibody which you can give to an infant directly and it shows good results. So in your opinion, I mean, the strategy, there could be one strategy, you immunize moms, expecting moms versus infants directly. How do you think about the end market shaking out eventually?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Angela, do you want to say how we could compete potentially with an antibody in infants?\nAngela Hwang: Yes. I mean, first of all, if you look at where the -- most of the morbidity and mortality is happening, it's really at the under 6 months, right, in that age group and also with preterm babies. And so you really need that protection from day 1. And I think that that's where we believe our differentiation is. From birth, literally from the moment of birth, you have protection. And you have duration of protection throughout the 6 months, which is what we've shown in our clinical trial. So I think while there -- I mean, obviously, it's great to have many different options. I think that the option that we have with our vaccine is truly a unique one and one that plays well to the situation with the infants.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. And of course, Andrew made also the point, with vaccines, we do not have co-pays. And antibodies are quite expensive, and you do have co-pays.\nOperator: Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nBrian Tsang: This is Brian on for Tim. Just two from us. What is Pfizer's current level of interest in Alzheimer's disease? And do you think there are compelling business development opportunities in the market? Or would the efforts likely to be homegrown?  And then second, on the Prevnar 20 and the competition. Wondering if you can opine on Merck's strategy, which is to bifurcate the market between peds and adults and have a product tailored to each segment. They have strains in each and they will be going head-to-head against Prevnar. They said a tailored approach is better than a one-size-fits-all approach, which is what Prevnar is. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Clearly, as you know, Pfizer had externalized their neuroscience portfolio, and we have created a company that's working on that actually. And we have a very significant equity over there.  We are monitoring how science is evolving. And apparently, there are a few things that are happening right now. I'm not referring only to the positive data of one study that we just saw, I'm more referring to earlier science that is emerging that seems to have a high promising for most clinical results.  So we are monitoring that. And if we think that there is a good opportunity, we may reexamine entering. The reason why we actually want to exit is because we felt the science is not ready at the time.  Now I will move it to Angela to answer your second question.\nAngela Hwang: We're really proud of our pneumococcal vaccine franchise. And I want to begin with just talking about the great successes that Prevnar 20 has had since its launch. Even though it's competing with other -- with another pneumococcal or other pneumococcal vaccines, we have a 95% market share. We have 97% formulary access. And we just recently had an updated ACIP recommendation that is going to enable Prevnar 20 to be used for catch-ups in those that are 65 plus as well as 65 under. And so I think that, that is a great demonstration of the leadership and the legacy that Pfizer has in pneumococcal vaccines or respiratory vaccines and the tremendous relationships and knowledge that we have in the space.  Equally, that plays out in the pediatric space. So even though we're obviously anticipating the launch of pediatric Prevnar 20, but in the meantime, Prevnar 13 is competing really well with the PCV15. I think that, again, the relationships that we have, the deep trust and knowledge that physicians have of the -- of our pneumococcal vaccine is really standing -- is really helping us competitively. And I think that there's great anticipation for the 5 additional serotypes that you're going to be able to get with Prevnar 20 over 15 in the pediatric space.  So I think all in all, we're off to an extremely strong start and we look forward to bringing our next vaccine to the market.\nAlbert Bourla: Okay. Thank you very, very much.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: Actually, kind of a qualitative question on how to think about OpEx dynamics going forward. It seems like we've seen some upward bias in spend at the company, which has kind of coincided with the ramp in COVID sales. I guess for a position where that COVID market resets as we transition past the pandemic, is there opportunity? Or should we think about a pullback in OpEx spend associated with that? Or should we think about these as more normalized levels of spend given all these growth initiatives that you're highlighting and investing behind at this point?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Nice question. And our new CFO clearly has views on this. So Dave, what do you think?\nDavid Denton: Chris, good question. Listen, before getting into -- it's probably a little too early for guidance for '23. But my expectation is that there would not be a pullback in expenses. I think if anything, what we're fortunate to have is a very robust launch schedule over the next 18 months. And we're really focused on investing to make sure that those launches are extremely successful and these medicines get in the hands of patients pretty quickly.  And so if anything, our focus is to get behind these launches, make sure that we execute them flawlessly and that we see the ramp-up and drive our sales performance, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 time frame.\nOperator: Next is Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Thanks for the question. Just had a few. The slide on long-term growth is really helpful. On the $20 billion on Slide 9 that you guys have highlighted, can you talk to the long-term contribution that is not COVID? I know there's some -- there's a long-term piece for COVID, but most investors are focused on kind of the non-COVID drivers. And then on I&I, looking to next year when we'll have many biosimilars launching for Humira, how much of market disruption do you think we'll see from higher buyers, similar volumes and payer preferences? I'm thinking about the effect on CIBINQO and then the etrasimod launch specifically, but also Xeljanz and Inflectra.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. I will ask Angela to answer the second question. On the first one, maybe I can give some clarifications. On the $20 billion, so we have included revenues from new launches. This is our estimations for 2030. New launches that are happening either started in '22, CIBINQO, for example, is there, because it started. And then we are adding claims or are about to happen and we have the list in the appendix. And in this list, excluding the BD, which we do not count over there, we count on the previous bar, where we have the $25 billion of revenues, are summing to $20 billion in our expectation.  Just to clarify, this does not include COVID. This is excluding COVID, excluding new things that may come from COVID, excluding new things that may come in antivirals or new vaccines or combination vaccines or any of that. These are not part of that.  Now in the other pipeline, which are things that are not in the near, near short term and things that will launch after the 18 months period all the way to '30, clearly, a lot of these things maybe are not known to you yet. But among the things that are known to you and that should be included over there, should be the GLP-1, should be any combinations between flu and COVID or RSV, should be our interferon , and the Lyme vaccines, the Arvinas, should be the gene therapies that could come. All of that should count towards that bar that we haven't quantified yet publicly. Of course, we know what we expect ourselves. Thank you very much. Now, Angela. The I&I and the vaccine launch.\nAngela Hwang: So the way to think about it is the biologics market and the oral market is -- the way we think about it is that it's different. And the reason I say that is because there is -- if you look at the treatment algorithms and how the biologics are used and how the orals are used, you picked Xeljanz as an example, right? Clearly, there, the label says that you have to have used anti-TNF before you move on to an oral JAK. And so I don't think that the competition is across biologics. With orals, I think the competition is literally with HUMIRA and the biosimilars of Humira, and then the orals have their role.  So I'll use Xeljanz as one example. I'll use etrasimod as another example. There, the benefit of this is that you have an oral therapy that actually can be used earlier line and actually pre-biologic. So again, there, you -- it's the different lines of treatment and the fact that I think there are distinct places where you would use an oral and a distinct place where you would use a biologic, and I don't think that's the crossover.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. We're running a little bit late, so we'll have 3 more questions. And we'll try to make -- answer them very quickly.\nOperator: Next is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: I was just wondering on PAXLOVID, it looks like there's going to be some doses remaining on the current U.S. contract as we head into 2023. So just maybe, I know you talked about how COMIRNATY would work as we move to a commercial market. But maybe just help us think about how that will work here in the U.S. as we transition out of the pandemic here.  And the second question I had is just any more detail you can share on the Prevnar data in peds regarding the serotype coverage? I know that was a question that came out post the Phase III data.\nAlbert Bourla: Very quickly on the PAXLOVID, it is not very different than what is happening with the vaccine. There will be a transition period. We will have to announce the list price, then we have to work with the U.S. government to transition so that when they stop distributing their, let's say, goods that they have, we will, let's say, start and we have a seamless transition. So the market will always become covered.  But we will give more details given these dynamics, what happens and when this happens, the transition at next -- in the guidance for next year. Mikael, anything you have to say on the pediatrics?\nMikael Dolsten: Just very brief that we have had positive studies in U.S. 3-plus-1 schedule, European Union 2-plus-1, after either 4 or 3 doses, which is the toddler complete schedule. We covered 20 serotypes in U.S. and 19 in the EU. But the totality of data across all endpoints, we believe, clearly speaks to that this is an important vaccine that adds coverage. And it's likely going to be the vaccine in the near term and for quite many years that have the broadest coverage.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: In terms of RSV, if you could share some thoughts in terms of the velocity of the uptake that you're expecting? Is flu a good barometer? And how quickly do you think, if that's the case, that we could possibly reach through? And then with etrasimod, in the previous owner's hands, there were additional opportunities, I believe, Crohn's disease data, Phase II; atopic dermatitis, Phase III, were originally in the time lines for calendar 2022. Will we get some insights on that -- on those clinical programs?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. I will ask -- actually, for the clinical programs, William, to speak a little bit about that.\nWilliam Pao: Yes. Sure. For etrasimod, we have nothing new to update at this time, Chris.\nAlbert Bourla: All right. And then for RSV, I would say, clearly, we think that it could become like flu-like. I think all respiratory disease eventually will have coverage like we have right now in flu. The question is how often that will happen. And that will depend on several factors. Education, of course, of the people and their physicians, but also the availability of combination programs and products that could significantly bring all 3 of them together, RSV, COVID and flu.\nOperator: Next, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: I wanted to ask two questions on pricing today, if I may. Perhaps first one, Albert, I know the COVID vaccine repricing was a very bold decision. And I understand the dynamics around the value proposition, the pandemic versus endemic era pricing, et cetera. But I think the sheer magnitude of the increase is making a lot of investors ask questions around ESG implications, any political blowback, et cetera. I'm just curious how you guys thought about this very important decision and how you're thinking about the expectation on net pricing.  And then separately, on PAXLOVID. I know you're running a 10-day trial versus the 5-day course that's currently approved. Does that mean PAXLOVID will effectively become 2x the price once a 10-day course is approved?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. I can answer both of them. Look, I think what was very bold and the right absolutely decision was to price the PAXLOVID during the pandemic at a very, very, very low price. Clearly, the price that -- excuse me, the vaccine at a very, very low price. That was the right thing to do, and we did it and we maintained that for the years to come.  Now that we are coming to the end of this period and as we are moving to very different product, which has very different presentations, which are -- now we are moving to single instead of mass vial, multi-dose vial, we are pricing the vaccine according to the cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness of the current vaccine, the way that CDC is pricing it, is way, way, way below than what the price that we have set at $110 and $130. Also, keep in mind that people will not see any difference and the system will get the benefit of a cost-effective product. And the people wouldn't see any difference because there's no copay.  Now on the PAXLOVID, I think it's too early to speak. We haven't announced any price. And we do not know what will be the outcome of the studies or the outcome of a new class that is coming following PAXLOVID.\nOperator: Our last question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger: So my two questions are regarding the core growth, which was 2% operationally in the third quarter, could you talk about what you're assuming and how we should think about growth prospects in the future, specifically in the fourth quarter since you've guided to that in your updated guidance? And then second, could you provide an update -- and I might have missed this, if I did, I apologize. But could you provide an update on your next-gen oral antiviral for COVID?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. One, on the 2% operational, excluding COVID, just to make a clarification, if you exclude also the contract manufacturing business that we have that was really COVID-related, it has very increased revenues last year because we were contract manufacturing for BioNTech territories that we don't have to do now because BioNTech took over for their territories their own manufacturing. In fact, the growth was 4% of our pharmaceutical business, excluding COVID and excluding this piece of contract manufacturing. Now Angela, based on that, what will we expect to be the growth trajectory?\nAngela Hwang: Well, we've talked about our 5-year CAGR, right, to be 6%. And just I want to reiterate that, that is exactly the track that we're on. Every year does not necessarily have to look identical. But over the 5-year period, we're absolutely confident that we're going to deliver the 6% CAGR.\nAlbert Bourla: All right. So thank you very much. So with that, I think we are close to bring our call to a close. Please don't forget to attend our event on December 12, where we will provide details about our very important new product launches in the next 18 months in some of our most important pipeline, potential new medicines and vaccines. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's earnings call, and we appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will briefly touch on some recent highlights. I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve.  In addition to generating a stellar financial performance, since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination of treatment of TALZENNA and XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate for adolescents and young adults, as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity.  Just this morning, we announced positive top line data from the Phase III clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth.  We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on 3 broad therapeutic areas: primary care, specialty care and oncology. We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several potential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years.  We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a Phase III study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a Phase I study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one shot.  We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively.  Less than 6 months ago after launching An Accord for a Healthier World, a breakthrough initiative designed to close the health equity gap for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products have arrived to these countries, and we are working with governments on health system improvements that can help make sure these products reach those in need.  And of course, we continue to lead the fight against COVID-19. Most notably, our Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency and several other regulatory bodies. And as part of Pfizer's commitment to providing equitable access to COVID-19 oral treatments, we agreed to supply at a not-for-profit price up to 6 million PAXLOVID treatment courses to the Global Fund for low and lower middle income countries.  An exciting quarter, for sure. But in our company and our industry, it's all about what's next. The next breakthrough medicine or vaccine, the next game-changing, the next solution to an unmet patient need. This continued pursuit of what's next is embedded in Pfizer's DNA and the foundational driver of our purpose: breakthroughs that change patients' lives. It's also why we have confidence that Pfizer's story is a story of growth.  We recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer-term growth projects, particularly in the '25 to '30 time frame. That's understandable given that we currently expect a negative impact of approximately $17 billion in revenues from losses of exclusivity during that period based on our internal calculations. We believe we not only can overcome these expected declines, but also can potentially generate strong growth through the end of the decade.  Let's take a closer look on how we expect to accomplish this. Our strong capital position has given us the ability to pursue business development opportunities with the potential, if successful, of course, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top line expectations.  We believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 1/3 of the way there and that we have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target.  Perhaps even more exciting is the wave of potential growth drivers emerging from our R&D pipeline in the near term. Over the next 18 months, we expect to have up to 19 new products or indications in the market, including the 5 for which we have already begun co-promotions or commercialization earlier this year. We can find -- you can find the list of these launches in the appendix of the presentation we posted today for this earnings call.  If successful, these 19 launches, of which more than 2/3 have the potential to be blockbusters, will be the most ever in Pfizer's history. The 15 in-house-developed projects alone could potentially represent approximately $20 billion in 2030 sales, which would more than offset the expected LOE impact.  Many of these programs are already largely de-risked from a clinical perspective. The majority of them were discovered in-house and nearly all of them would be for indications outside of COVID-19. If approved, we expect each of these to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.  And of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the '24 to '30 time line. These include gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our oral GLP-1 for diabetes and obesity; a potential combo vaccine that would cover flu and COVID in one shot and many, many more.  With regard to our COVID-19 products, while their sales may fall from our expected 2022 levels of approximately combined $55 billion, we believe our COVID-19 franchises will remain multibillion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future which should serve as a buffer for any unforeseen challenges with other products in our portfolio.  Our confidence to execute this plan stems from the depth of our financial resources and the firepower it gives us to pursue business development opportunities, the powerful brand equity we have built up over the past 170 years and further enhanced in the past 2 years. According to a recent survey, our brand awareness now stands at an impressive 82% and our favorability stands at 61% compared with 42% for the industry as a whole, results that were obtained just a couple of months ago. And of course, the strength of the 3 foundational pillars of our company, our world-class scientific, our world-class commercial and our world-class manufacturing engines, and you will see on this slide some highlights of each one of them.  Let me now briefly highlight 3 potential blockbusters that we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. RSV is an area of significant unmet need, particularly in older adults and infants. Each year, it is estimated more than 177,000 older adults are hospitalized and 14,000 of them die in the U.S. alone due to RSV that is confirmed by a diagnostic test. We believe we have the potential to be a leader in this space and have a real impact on public health.  On March 24 of this year, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our RSV vaccine candidate for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. We are excited to report positive top line data from the Phase III RENOIR trial in late August, with the recent presentation of detailed results at IDWeek 22.  A preplanned interim analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 67% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, defined by 2 or more symptoms. And vaccine efficacy of 85.7% was observed in participants with more severe disease, presenting 3 or more RSV-associated symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness.  We are also excited about the potential for our maternal RSV vaccine candidate. Globally, each year, RSV sickens more than 6.5 million infants under 6 months old and kills approximately 45,000. As announced this morning, our maternal RSV study met the success criterion for 1 of the 2 primary endpoints. Vaccine efficacy of 81.8% was observed against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life. And high efficacy of 69.4% was demonstrated through the first 6 months of life.  So there is the potential that, subject to regulatory approval, by late 2023, early 2024, we could have the only RSV maternal vaccine in the market, along with an RSV vaccine for older adults, that has high efficacy, and it is well tolerated with no safety concerns.  Combined, the 2 indications represent a potential multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity if approved, especially with our highly respected primary care sales force executing these launches. Including the RSV antiviral investigational candidates we acquired with ReViral, we aim to have end-to-end solutions with both preventative vaccines and therapeutics to treat those infected with RSV.  Ulcerative colitis or UC is a chronic and often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that affects an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Many patients living with this disease never achieve or maintain remission, and physicians are seeking effective, proven oral therapies with a favorable benefit/risk profile that can be an attractive first-line advanced therapy option. As a result, we expect the market opportunity to grow by about 50% over the next 5 years.  The positive Phase III data from the ELEVATE UC 12 and 52 trials reinforce our belief that etrasimod has a differentiated clinical profile and can be an important treatment option if approved. We believe that etrasimod can be a multibillion-dollar blockbuster product. We expect to launch the product in the U.S. as soon as the second half of 2023, pending regulatory approval, through our specialty care sales force, which already has strong relationships in the UC market, thanks to its work with Xeljanz, biosimilars, et cetera.  Lastly, let's look at migraine. Following our acquisition of Biohaven in early October, we are now aiming to build the world's leading global migraine franchise with the potential to impact 1 billion patients around the world. Migraine is a debilitating disease and has 11.6% prevalence worldwide. In the U.S. alone, there are 40 million patients with migraine, and 1 out of 5 women are migraine sufferers right now. The economic burden is significant at $36 billion per year. We believe our portfolio, including NURTEC ODT, VYDURA and zavegepant, could meet a range of needs in the market, allowing physicians and patients to decide how to appropriately manage migraine treatment and prevention. As a result, we see the potential to reach more than $6 billion in peak revenues altogether.  In the U.S., NURTEC is growing very well, including the impact of Pfizer's co-promoting, which began in August pre-close. NURTEC has further strengthened its #1 market share position in the oral CGRP market, and we expect even stronger growth as we deliver on our promise to further enhance our commercial efforts behind this program.  Outside the U.S., it has been approved in the EU, U.K., Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and we have filed for registration in an additional 10 markets. While this is not a new product launch, we believe this is a great example of how we can take this portfolio to new heights by leveraging the full strength of Pfizer's global commercial engine, including in primary care physicians.  Moving over to zavegepant. We recently expect to launch zavegepant intranasal in the U.S. next year, pending FDA approval, and we plan to globally commercialize. Lastly, the oral prevention Phase III trial is ongoing with a data readout expected in the third quarter.  So with that, I turn it over to Dave to update you on the results and outlook for the financials. After Dave, Mikael will speak about the progression of our pipeline. Thank you. On the December 12, what you should expect, it is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science and the market potential of those launches as well as some of the most important pipeline potential new medicines and vaccines that they are not going to be launched in the next 18 months but will be launched in the period between '24 and '30.  Now for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD. Thank you, Aamir. And also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID and are we going to provide it and when for '23, et cetera. Yes. Let me say a few words about the push and pulls, and then I will ask Angela to complement and then speak about how we see the RSV market.  Clearly, '23 is a very, very important year for us given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months. And most of them will happen in '23 and some beginning of the first quarter of '24. But we are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven and the Global Blood, $20 billion of peak sales were expected 2030 sales we are expecting from those launches. So it's a very, very big number. And it's very important for us to do it well. In addition, so clearly, that will bring -- our non-COVID business will be a significant boost for our non-COVID business.  Now when we move to COVID, we expect '23 will be a transition year with likely in the U.S. moving from a government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics. The timing is not certain. So we are ready to do it ASAP, but we will be phased over the years. And it likely will not be the same for PAXLOVID or COMIRNATY. And clearly also, there will be some stuff that will have to be depleted in '23. And clearly, will be new price dynamics as we are moving to '23. So COVID will be a little bit more of a transitional year in '23 until it will be established into more like a flu volumes type of market. But of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease, that will bring both therapeutic and vaccines into a multibillion-dollars franchise. But we are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our '23 numbers when we will provide guidance.  Now Angela, anything to add on the push and pulls? You are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult. Very well, Angela, and I agree with you. Thank you very much. Mikael, what about the RSV data? Thank you, Mikael. Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of NURTEC in the third quarter, let me make a comment on COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID and the franchise.  Clearly, we said that we will provide us good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year. Now you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging. But also, the way you are asking the question, is it unthinkable -- is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise? Well, taking that it is $55 billion right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030, could be that. But it's not clear that it will be done. So that will depend on the virus and how it behaves. It will depend on if it will become standard practice to vaccinate together with flu. If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction. So I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given that where we are right now.  Now, what about NURTEC sales? Thank you very much. Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela. And what about vitiligo? And William, can you please address a little bit the issue about the rebounds that was also mentioned? Drew, thank you. In the interest of time, let me give the first answer. Yes, you are right. As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this type of efficacy, it will be recommended, there is 0 co-pay irrelevant of the insurance. If it is commercial or if it is public, their obligation is 0 co-pay from the payers, and they have to cover it. Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecules? Thank you, Mikael. Another reason to attend this great event. Maybe I'll pass that to Aamir. Thank you, Aamir. Yes, we didn't answer the mRNA and how we think about it, Mikael. Thank you very much, Mikael. Yes. Angela, do you want to say how we could compete potentially with an antibody in infants? Thank you very much. And of course, Andrew made also the point, with vaccines, we do not have co-pays. And antibodies are quite expensive, and you do have co-pays. Thank you very much. Clearly, as you know, Pfizer had externalized their neuroscience portfolio, and we have created a company that's working on that actually. And we have a very significant equity over there.  We are monitoring how science is evolving. And apparently, there are a few things that are happening right now. I'm not referring only to the positive data of one study that we just saw, I'm more referring to earlier science that is emerging that seems to have a high promising for most clinical results.  So we are monitoring that. And if we think that there is a good opportunity, we may reexamine entering. The reason why we actually want to exit is because we felt the science is not ready at the time.  Now I will move it to Angela to answer your second question. Okay. Thank you very, very much. Thank you, Chris. Nice question. And our new CFO clearly has views on this. So Dave, what do you think? Yes. I will ask Angela to answer the second question. On the first one, maybe I can give some clarifications. On the $20 billion, so we have included revenues from new launches. This is our estimations for 2030. New launches that are happening either started in '22, CIBINQO, for example, is there, because it started. And then we are adding claims or are about to happen and we have the list in the appendix. And in this list, excluding the BD, which we do not count over there, we count on the previous bar, where we have the $25 billion of revenues, are summing to $20 billion in our expectation.  Just to clarify, this does not include COVID. This is excluding COVID, excluding new things that may come from COVID, excluding new things that may come in antivirals or new vaccines or combination vaccines or any of that. These are not part of that.  Now in the other pipeline, which are things that are not in the near, near short term and things that will launch after the 18 months period all the way to '30, clearly, a lot of these things maybe are not known to you yet. But among the things that are known to you and that should be included over there, should be the GLP-1, should be any combinations between flu and COVID or RSV, should be our interferon , and the Lyme vaccines, the Arvinas, should be the gene therapies that could come. All of that should count towards that bar that we haven't quantified yet publicly. Of course, we know what we expect ourselves. Thank you very much. Now, Angela. The I&I and the vaccine launch. Thank you, Angela. We're running a little bit late, so we'll have 3 more questions. And we'll try to make -- answer them very quickly. Very quickly on the PAXLOVID, it is not very different than what is happening with the vaccine. There will be a transition period. We will have to announce the list price, then we have to work with the U.S. government to transition so that when they stop distributing their, let's say, goods that they have, we will, let's say, start and we have a seamless transition. So the market will always become covered.  But we will give more details given these dynamics, what happens and when this happens, the transition at next -- in the guidance for next year. Mikael, anything you have to say on the pediatrics? Yes. I will ask -- actually, for the clinical programs, William, to speak a little bit about that. All right. And then for RSV, I would say, clearly, we think that it could become like flu-like. I think all respiratory disease eventually will have coverage like we have right now in flu. The question is how often that will happen. And that will depend on several factors. Education, of course, of the people and their physicians, but also the availability of combination programs and products that could significantly bring all 3 of them together, RSV, COVID and flu. Yes. I can answer both of them. Look, I think what was very bold and the right absolutely decision was to price the PAXLOVID during the pandemic at a very, very, very low price. Clearly, the price that -- excuse me, the vaccine at a very, very low price. That was the right thing to do, and we did it and we maintained that for the years to come.  Now that we are coming to the end of this period and as we are moving to very different product, which has very different presentations, which are -- now we are moving to single instead of mass vial, multi-dose vial, we are pricing the vaccine according to the cost effectiveness. And the cost effectiveness of the current vaccine, the way that CDC is pricing it, is way, way, way below than what the price that we have set at $110 and $130. Also, keep in mind that people will not see any difference and the system will get the benefit of a cost-effective product. And the people wouldn't see any difference because there's no copay.  Now on the PAXLOVID, I think it's too early to speak. We haven't announced any price. And we do not know what will be the outcome of the studies or the outcome of a new class that is coming following PAXLOVID. Thank you. One, on the 2% operational, excluding COVID, just to make a clarification, if you exclude also the contract manufacturing business that we have that was really COVID-related, it has very increased revenues last year because we were contract manufacturing for BioNTech territories that we don't have to do now because BioNTech took over for their territories their own manufacturing.

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns. As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities has expanded significantly over the past several years and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever.  During the first 9 months of 2022, the company has deployed and committed capital in 3 main areas: first, we've invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D as we continue to support our growing pipeline of innovative medicines. These investments are squarely focused on driving revenue growth through 2030.  Secondly, in the first 3 quarters of this year, we have invested approximately $8 billion in completed business transactions. Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, the company completed investments of more than $18 billion in transactions, including both Biohaven and GBT, which brings us to approximately $26 billion in capital deployed for business development transactions thus far in 2022 alone. These transactions illustrate our progress towards the goal of adding $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenues through BD.  And finally, we have returned nearly $9 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of both dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital allocation will continue to be a major focus for Pfizer. So with that, let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I'll limit my remarks largely to adjusted and operating growth figures.  Third quarter revenues demonstrated strength across many areas of the business, but much of that strength was somewhat obscured by our incredibly strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Given the strength in the prior year, revenues this quarter decreased 2% operationally. However, looking at it on a 2-year basis, revenues this quarter were up more than 120% compared to the third quarter of 2020. The slight decrease compared to last year was in line with our expectations given the phasing of scheduled deliveries of COMIRNATY, which we discussed in our earnings call last quarter. Also underlying our results this quarter was the strong performance of PAXLOVID as well as continued strength from a number of our other key products.  Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to the COVID products, Pfizer's revenues grew 2% operationally in the quarter. Gross margins expanded by 1,450 basis points versus the third quarter of LY. This improvement is largely due to increased sales of higher-margin PAXLOVID and decreased sales of lower-gross margin COMIRNATY compared to last year. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of a $400 million charge related to excess raw materials for PAXLOVID. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we intentionally chose to order additional stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand if an extreme need were to arise.  Adjusted SI&A expenses in the third quarter grew 23% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY and higher health care reform fees.  The 2% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q3 was primarily driven by increased cost to develop recently acquired assets as well as investments for certain oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines programs. This was partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and various late-stage clinical programs.  The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter was 4.4%, significantly lower than typical, driven by tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning several tax years. Excluding these tax resolutions, the underlying tax rate was consistent with historical trends.  As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.51 grew by 6%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.78 grew 44% on an operational basis in the quarter. Now foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues by approximately $950 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 this quarter.  Now let me move to our updated 2022 guidance. Given our strong third quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for revenues by $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. This operational increase on the bottom line would have been even higher if not for an incremental $0.06 negative impact due to higher acquired IPR&D expenses.  Partially offsetting these operational increases is the impact of additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we last updated guidance in late July. Incremental foreign exchange movements negatively impacted our expectations for 2022 revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $700 million and $0.09, respectively.  The net impact of these cross-currents result in increases to the midpoints of our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges. These revised ranges reflect operational growth rates of 31% for revenues and 70% for adjusted diluted earnings per share at the midpoint compared to 2021. And this was up from our previous operational growth expectations for revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 29% and 65%, respectively. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we now expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $34 billion, up by $2 billion compared to our prior guidance. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance range unchanged despite the negative incremental impact of changes in FX.  You can see on this slide our updated costs and expense guidance which incorporates our performance to date, our recent acquisitions and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year. More information on each of these updates can be found in this morning's press release. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March of 2022.  In closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation.  With that, I'll now turn it over to Mikael. Yes. Thank you, Albert. Maybe let me discuss the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise. I think if you look out longer-term, the franchise is going to be a multibillion-dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu. So therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and the therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, are going to be quite relevant for many years to come.  Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year. We will break out that guidance specifically, so you can hold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes. Yes. Steve, this is Dave. As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product is performing. If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it was about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume. And then if you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3. So I think this shows the promise of this product, number one.  And number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force and into our primary care field force, we can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the U.S. and abroad. Chris, good question. Listen, before getting into -- it's probably a little too early for guidance for '23. But my expectation is that there would not be a pullback in expenses. I think if anything, what we're fortunate to have is a very robust launch schedule over the next 18 months. And we're really focused on investing to make sure that those launches are extremely successful and these medicines get in the hands of patients pretty quickly.  And so if anything, our focus is to get behind these launches, make sure that we execute them flawlessly and that we see the ramp-up and drive our sales performance, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 time frame."

            "content": "Sure, Albert. Well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of PAXLOVID versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19. And we had additional end points there which we showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients, 100% who got PAXLOVID were DC-ed to home versus 53% placebo. We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in mean days hospitalized versus 100 patients and also a 73% reduction in any COVID-19-related medical visits. Importantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustained time to symptom resolution of an impact of 2 to 3 days of PAXLOVID versus placebo.  But most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually that rebound occurs with COVID, in general. For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients who got placebo with COVID and actually, 1/3 of those had recurrent symptoms after the resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with PAXLOVID.  Importantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful. Whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that you can also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance. So again, PAXLOVID is not associated with resistance but the antibodies are. So we feel very confident that PAXLOVID has a significant impact and a role against COVID. Yes. Sure. For etrasimod, we have nothing new to update at this time, Chris."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond.  With anchor products such as COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, IBRANCE and XTANDI, we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology and certain cancers. We have deep expertise in these areas, and there is exciting science emerging. I will share updates from 3 of these today: respiratory, metabolic and prostate cancer.  Building on our success with COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, we see enormous potential to help address major causes of respiratory disease through vaccines and therapeutics. Work on the next-generation vaccine candidates are well underway. And last week, we started a Phase I clinical trial of our second-generation oral therapeutic candidate.  Our quadrivalent modRNA flu program has progressed into Phase III, and we will start shortly a Phase I study of an mRNA-based vaccine candidate that combines our quadrivalent modRNA flu vaccine candidate with the Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine based on BA.4/5. In RSV, we believe a dual focus on developing a vaccine and antivirals could make a significant impact globally. I will share new data with you shortly. PAXLOVID continues to be an important tool in helping to combat the impact of COVID-19. And secondary endpoints from the EPIC-High Risk study as well as data from real-world evidence support the product's efficacy profile.  In the EPIC-HR study, PAXLOVID reduced COVID-19-related all-cause deaths and ICU admissions by 100% and COVID-19-related hospitalization by 86% in unvaccinated, high-risk patients compared to placebo. It also reduced the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by 2 to 3 days compared to placebo. We are pleased to see PAXLOVID leading the COVID-19 treatment landscape and remain confident in its safety and efficacy in treating patients at high-risk for severe outcomes.  We recently reported a positive interim analysis from a Phase III study in older adults of our novel RSV vaccine candidate, which targets the prefusion F protein on both RSV A and B, without need for an adjuvant. We saw remarkable vaccine efficacy across the first RSV season. The vaccine was extremely well tolerated with favorable systemic tolerability, a key consideration for vaccines.  We also are developing the RSVpreF vaccine candidate for use in pregnant women so that protection may be conferred to newborns. And this morning, we announced exciting results from a preplanned interim analysis of our Phase III trial. We observed vaccine efficacy of nearly 82% against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness or MA-LRTI due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life and efficacy of more than 69% through the first 6 months of life. Success criterion was not met for the second primary endpoint. However, clinically meaningful efficacy was observed with MA-LRTI of 57% in infant from birth through 90 days of life and efficacy of 51% over the 6-month follow-up period. The Data Monitoring Committee indicated the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns for either vaccinated women or their newborns.  Given these impressive results, we look forward to filing BLA for both older adults and pregnant women with the U.S. FDA by year-end with potential launches in '23. If approved, our maternal RSV vaccine candidate potentially would be the first available to help prevent this common and potentially life-threatening respiratory illness in young infants.  Turning now to prostate cancer. We're building upon the standard of care set by XTANDI in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant population. The Phase III EMBARK study of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to read out first half of '23. And the Phase III TALAPRO-3 study of TALZENNA and XTANDI is expected in '24. These trials may indicate benefit in up to 20% more patients than are currently treated and potentially prolong duration of use, subject to clinical success and regulatory approval.  Now in TALAPRO-2, we observed the first clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor plus XTANDI in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutation. Irrespective of HRR gene mutation status, the study achieved its primary endpoint. The combination delivered a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival and appears to have resulted in the longest observed such survival in a randomized trial in this setting. We are encouraged by these results and believe that TALZENNA in prostate cancer may have blockbuster potential, subject to regulatory approval.  Turning to metabolic disorders. I previously shared that we are developing 2 oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, danuglipron and 1532. Recently presented Phase Ib data for 1532 show dose-dependent reduction from baseline at 4 to 6 weeks in mean daily glucose, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and body weight. Both candidates are potentially best-in-class and differentiated by offering full agonism, which may be required to achieve the same level of response as injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists while offering a convenient once daily dose for 1532. Glucose effects plateau at lower doses, while body weight effects continue to improve at higher doses.  The planned Phase IIb study will evaluate 1532 versus both oral semaglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes and separately versus placebo in obesity. Using semaglutide as a comparator in the type 2 diabetes arm should allow us to observe potential early signs of differentiation in efficacy, tolerability and safety. We will evaluate doses up to 260 milligrams in this study, higher than the studies in the Phase Ib. We plan to begin dosing soon and anticipate the readout in first quarter 2024.  The ongoing Phase IIb study of danuglipron in obesity with now once-monthly titration is expected to complete second half of 2023. Data from these studies will be available in relatively quick succession and, assuming clinical success, allow us to select one based on efficacy, tolerability and dosing to advance to Phase III in both type 2 diabetes and obesity.  In closing, we are excited about the developing science within these franchisees and share here recent and anticipated milestones in the next 18 months. We look forward to continue our development both for potential patient benefit and sustainable growth.  Thank you. Let me turn over to Chris to start Q&A. Thank you for the question. So as you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data and the 2 separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing. And to our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important. And that was defined as severe, medically attended lower tract respiratory infections, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy. That is defined by clinical features, such as the rate and the stress of respiration, oxygenation levels, et cetera, in the children and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not. We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization. When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalizations. I'm probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering children as appropriately studied in this vaccination. So we're very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value. Yes. Thank you for asking. Clearly, we think that there are 2 factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders. And we think that PROTAC, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in down-regulating the estrogen receptor. And selecting the right patients compared to standard of care, that includes selecting patients that have estrogen receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs and it's related to the property of the drug itself.  We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we had in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4 drug. And that may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and next waves. Yes. So I'm excited to share we're broadening that platform. You heard about advance of the mRNA flu vaccine successfully to the next stages. Albert mentioned plans that are ongoing to combine it with COVID vaccine to build more broader respiratory vaccine with indeed improved convenience in single administration, single-patient visits.  We are on our way to the Phase I study, together with BioNTech, on our shingles vaccine that really aim to deliver the power of the mRNA, but remove what we've seen as a pretty significant issue with of the current adjuvant vaccine.  We're looking at several other mRNA vaccine that we will share in proper time. But also, that Aamir briefly alluded to, we have made progress in our alliance with Beam to really identify the first type of candidates that will move forward to genetic medicine in some of the important rare diseases. And we're looking at application at certain areas of in vivo cancer medications, where we think this technology can be more successful where compared to the past of cancer vaccines. Just very brief that we have had positive studies in U.S. 3-plus-1 schedule, European Union 2-plus-1, after either 4 or 3 doses, which is the toddler complete schedule. We covered 20 serotypes in U.S. and 19 in the EU. But the totality of data across all endpoints, we believe, clearly speaks to that this is an important vaccine that adds coverage. And it's likely going to be the vaccine in the near term and for quite many years that have the broadest coverage."

            "content": "Thanks for the question, Colin. The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before. And principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs. That's going to continue to be our north star. We're looking for deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade. And importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerating our commercial momentum. And if you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022, including Arena, Biohaven, ReViral and GBT, they would all be very consistent with those priorities.  We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction. But you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD. Sure. Evan, thanks for the question. As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science. And the good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas. So you've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, I&I and, certainly, oncology. And our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it. And we feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different TAs."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Well, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. First and foremost, because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right? We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from COMIRNATY.  I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. And it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint. These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal.  Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit. There's 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for this vaccination. It's actually a -- it's quite a devastating disease. The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion. It is also underreported and underdiagnosed. And so we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education and to bring this vaccine to those who need it.  Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease. Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under 6 months old and those that are preterm. And actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from infant infections of RSV. So again, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here. As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines. And so that, coupled with our strength in women's health and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine.  And so bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations. We are also very well versed in our work with the vaccine technical committees around the world, in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is what's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these 2 tremendous breakthroughs. So I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio. Well, thank you for the question. So we can just talk a little bit about PAXLOVID and how that's been going. I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand-in-hand with the U.S. government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public.  The U.S. government and the state governments, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns. And equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of PAXLOVID.  So if you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written PAXLOVID. And what you have in addition to that is education that we've provided not only to doctors but also to pharmacists. We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write PAXLOVID.  And so I think the education is really firing off, both at a prescriber level but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments, to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education.  I will say that the Test to Treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for PAXLOVID.  So I think that it's -- frankly, I think it's going well. I think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall. But the fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this PAXLOVID already is a great indicator of their confidence with this.  And the fact that probably, the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for PAXLOVID. And actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible. And they include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally, risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of. And so I think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall. I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib. I think probably the main theme here is that there are not effective -- there aren't any treatments for these highly -- very serious inflammatory conditions today. So huge unmet need, huge -- just a place where there's just no options today. So the fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market, I think, will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options. Yes. I mean, first of all, if you look at where the -- most of the morbidity and mortality is happening, it's really at the under 6 months, right, in that age group and also with preterm babies. And so you really need that protection from day 1. And I think that that's where we believe our differentiation is. From birth, literally from the moment of birth, you have protection. And you have duration of protection throughout the 6 months, which is what we've shown in our clinical trial. So I think while there -- I mean, obviously, it's great to have many different options. I think that the option that we have with our vaccine is truly a unique one and one that plays well to the situation with the infants. We're really proud of our pneumococcal vaccine franchise. And I want to begin with just talking about the great successes that Prevnar 20 has had since its launch. Even though it's competing with other -- with another pneumococcal or other pneumococcal vaccines, we have a 95% market share. We have 97% formulary access. And we just recently had an updated ACIP recommendation that is going to enable Prevnar 20 to be used for catch-ups in those that are 65 plus as well as 65 under. And so I think that, that is a great demonstration of the leadership and the legacy that Pfizer has in pneumococcal vaccines or respiratory vaccines and the tremendous relationships and knowledge that we have in the space.  Equally, that plays out in the pediatric space. So even though we're obviously anticipating the launch of pediatric Prevnar 20, but in the meantime, Prevnar 13 is competing really well with the PCV15. I think that, again, the relationships that we have, the deep trust and knowledge that physicians have of the -- of our pneumococcal vaccine is really standing -- is really helping us competitively. And I think that there's great anticipation for the 5 additional serotypes that you're going to be able to get with Prevnar 20 over 15 in the pediatric space.  So I think all in all, we're off to an extremely strong start and we look forward to bringing our next vaccine to the market. So the way to think about it is the biologics market and the oral market is -- the way we think about it is that it's different. And the reason I say that is because there is -- if you look at the treatment algorithms and how the biologics are used and how the orals are used, you picked Xeljanz as an example, right? Clearly, there, the label says that you have to have used anti-TNF before you move on to an oral JAK. And so I don't think that the competition is across biologics. With orals, I think the competition is literally with HUMIRA and the biosimilars of Humira, and then the orals have their role.  So I'll use Xeljanz as one example. I'll use etrasimod as another example. There, the benefit of this is that you have an oral therapy that actually can be used earlier line and actually pre-biologic. So again, there, you -- it's the different lines of treatment and the fact that I think there are distinct places where you would use an oral and a distinct place where you would use a biologic, and I don't think that's the crossover. Well, we've talked about our 5-year CAGR, right, to be 6%. And just I want to reiterate that, that is exactly the track that we're on. Every year does not necessarily have to look identical. But over the 5-year period, we're absolutely confident that we're going to deliver the 6% CAGR."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's second quarter earnings call. We anticipate that this call will last 90 minutes.

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I am proud to say that Pfizer continued to deliver strong operational performance in the second quarter and has increased its full year 2022 operational financial forecasts for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per shares, all while operating in a challenging foreign exchange environment. Compared with the second quarter of 2021, global revenues were up 53% operationally to $27.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 100% operationally to $2.04. Both results exceeded consensus analyst expectations, and the quarterly revenue figure represented the largest in Pfizer's history. Key growth drivers for the quarter included PAXLOVID, Comirnaty, Eliquis and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax globally, and our Prevnar family of products in the U.S. Year-to-date, we have reached an estimated 845 million patients around the world with our innovative medicines and vaccines, which represents a 77% increase from the prior-year period. And we did all this while also taking steps to help address broader issues impacting global health, including climate change, equitable access and the war in Ukraine. So, where do we go from here? After two-and-a-half long years, like everyone else, we would hope that this global health crisis would be over soon. But as much as hope is important, hope is not science. And science is telling us that COVID-19 likely will remain a major global healthcare concern for years to come. We believe that Pfizer is well positioned not only to maintain but to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. In terms of our commercial leadership, we believe Pfizer's skills are even better suited for operating in open markets than they are for government-contracting markets and will be even more competitive when this transition happens. Recently, Angela announced a new commercial structure that prepares us to provide even better support for the ongoing Comirnaty and PAXLOVID revenue streams.  In terms of our scientific leadership, we expect to further enhance our position through the continued introduction of new innovations, including preparation for new variants of concern and potentially improving the durability of protection. So far, we have been fortunate that most of the variants have led to less severe illness, but there remains the possibility that a future variant could emerge that combines Omicron's contagiousness with the original virus's severity. This is a scenario no one wants to imagine, but one for which we need to be prepared why we're doing all these investments. That\u2019s why also it is critical that Pfizer continues to invest in the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. With this context as a backdrop, let me provide an update on our current COVID-19 offerings and then continue with other products. I will start with Comirnaty. To date, we have shipped more than 3.6 billion doses of our vaccine to 180 countries and territories around the world. Comirnaty remains the most utilized COVID-19 vaccine in the markets in which we operate that report market share data. Pfizer's cumulative share of doses administered in these markets have increased from 52% in January of this year to 63% in July of this year. In developed markets, our share has increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period. Next, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of vaccine boosters for the fall. Outside the U.S., global regulators have issued guidance to advance an Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine candidate to help address the continued evolution of the virus. As such, Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted data to the European Medicines Agency on the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity for the company\u2019s bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccine candidate. We also continue to work with health authorities around the globe on regulatory submissions. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration recently asked biopharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop a modified vaccine containing an Omicron BA.4/BA.5 component and we begin clinical trials with these vaccine candidates. Pfizer is currently proceeding with development of a COVID-19 bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 booster vaccine candidate and is targeting this fall for rollout in the U.S., subject of course to regulatory authorization. Pfizer is well positioned to satisfy its current contractual obligations and potential demand within its production capacity through the end of the year. Because of our robust manufacturing capabilities, we are planning to deliver both variant vaccines in the fall, pending regulatory approvals. Turning to PAXLOVID, we continue to be very pleased with how things are progressing in the U.S. as we are seeing several initiatives supporting increased access for eligible patients. First, the number of facilities with PAXLOVID, the supply have continued to increase with more than 41,000 sites live as of July 15, an increase of more than 7,000 sites since early May. We are pleased with the FDA's July 6 revision of the Emergency Use Authorization for PAXLOVID that authorized state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe the treatment under certain conditions, thereby expanding access for patients. As you can see on this slide, we have seen a nearly five-fold increase in PAXLOVID utilization since the first quarter. We also continue to retain greater than 90% market share of oral COVID-19 treatments in the U.S. and are taking a state-by-state approach to engaging key government officials to discuss their access strategies. We are also continuing to work with states to educate consumers, healthcare providers and pharmacists about the importance of treating all appropriate high-risk patients rather than limiting treatment to the severely immunocompromised and unvaccinated. In spite of the strong growth, we have seen in PAXLOVID uptake in the U.S. due to our and the government's efforts, we estimate that a significant amount of eligible patients outside the U.S. are not yet being treated with the drug and may not know they are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. So, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow PAXLOVID utilization. For international developing markets, we are seeing significant increases in usage across many markets, reflecting the recent wave of BA.4/BA.5 and resulting increases in hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths. For example, over the month from June 24 to July 24, average daily deaths in Europe almost doubled from a low of 0.6 per 1 million people to 1.15 per 1 million; in Japan, they almost tripled from 0.12 per 1 million people to 0.34 per 1 million; and in Australia, they increased from 1.78 per 1 million people to 2.59 per 1 million. While we have less precise numbers on market shares outside the U.S., our internal estimates indicate that we saw an estimated 116% increase in usage between June 24 and July 15 across international developed markets where we have supply agreements. So, we believe there is a significant opportunity to continue the growth outside the U.S. as physicians become more knowledgeable about PAXLOVID and treat appropriate patients. While COVID-19 remains top of mind for many people, we are seeing encouraging performance with some of our other innovative products as well, and I wanted to take a moment to highlight two of them. We are very pleased with the success of our U.S. launch of Prevnar 20 for adults. Second quarter U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family of vaccines for adults were up 337% operationally, compared with the prior-year quarter to $431 million, with Prevnar 20 representing more than three quarters of the total adult revenue. The great majority of U.S. healthcare networks, IDNs and retailers, who have made formulary decisions, have chosen Prevnar 20 alone as their higher valency pneumococcal vaccine of choice to help protect adults. This has resulted in Prevnar 20 having a 97% market share. This is also the first time there has been a routine recommendation for Prevnar for people in the 19 to 64 age group with underlying medical conditions. This group has an increased risk for contracting pneumococcal pneumonia and, unfortunately, has historically been the hardest to activate. Lastly, we believe the simplicity of Prevnar 20 being the only vaccine that can help protect patients with one dose in one visit is preferable to competitors' offerings. Quarterly revenues for Ibrance grew 1% in the U.S. compared with the same quarter last year, despite a continued increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through Assistance Program. This marked the first quarterly revenue uptick in the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2020, which is an encouraging sign. Total volume in the U.S. increased 3% compared with the year ago quarter. Before I turn it over to Mikael, I want to touch on some actions we have taken recently to further demonstrate our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance, ESG principles. We recently announced an Accord for a Healthier World. Under this Accord, we are offering all of our patented, high-quality products that are available in the U.S. or the EU on a not-for-profit basis for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower income countries. This includes all future Pfizer products, as well. I am thrilled to say that the first product under this Accord has arrived in Rwanda, with more on the way. Pfizer's experts also held a session for 100 Rwandan medical professionals to discuss efficacy, safety and dosing of this milestone. This is just the first step of Accord implementation, but an important one that will impact many lives. We also recently announced our commitment to achieve the Net-Zero Standard across our value chain by year 2040. This is ten years ahead of a new voluntary external standard. This includes aiming to reduce our company emissions by 95% and value chain emissions by 90% within the next roughly 18 years. In response to the war in Ukraine, we are donating the equivalent of all profits from our sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Our first down payment of $5 million is going to eight global and local NGOs to support humanitarian relief and response efforts, and we will continue to channel these profits to the Ukrainian people until peace is achieved. I am also very proud to share with you that in a recently published report from MSCI, Pfizer\u2019s annual ESG rating increased three notches compared with June 2021, going from B to A. This is just the latest external recognition we have received for our commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of our colleagues' commitment to good governance practices, quality and integrity. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Dave will provide financial details on the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2022.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Albert. I\u2019d like to start by highlighting two recent leadership appointments. I\u2019ve appointed Annaliesa Anderson to lead Vaccine Research & Development, succeeding Kathrin Jansen, who previously announced her retirement. With more than two decades of biopharma R&D experience, Liesa most recently served as CSO for Bacterial Research and Hospital. Over the last two years, she has led the team of infectious disease biologists that designed and delivered PAXLOVID to an emergency use authorization. Under her leadership, we also advanced several bacterial vaccine programs into clinical development and approval. I\u2019ve also named Charlotte Allerton, CSO for Anti-Infectives, a new research unit. Creating this new research unit allows us to expand our focus beyond medicines that typically are used in hospitals. Charlotte is an esteemed scientist who will broaden our anti-viral strategies with additional efforts in antibacterial and anti-fungal science and medicines. Charlotte has been our Head of Medicine Design most notably co-leading the discovery and development of PAXLOVID and will continue in that role, as well. I have had the privilege to work closely with Liesa and Charlotte for more than 10 years and have been continuously impressed by them as world class scientists in their respective fields of expertise. Both have demonstrated good product hunting skills and a sound business mindset. I\u2019m looking forward to working with them in their new roles. Let\u2019s begin with COVID-19. The pandemic continues to evolve into a disease which is causing significant disease burden, including high rates of acute disease, medical care utilization, hospitalization and deaths, during the entire year. A growing number of patients affected by acute COVID infections are developing chronic disease and suffering from long COVID symptoms affecting multiple organs such as the lungs, heart, kidney and brain and the vascular system. We have seen major waves of variants of concern emerge quickly, become dominant, then be superseded by the next variant. Omicron and its sublineages are the most antigenically distinct compared to prior variants of concern, more transmissible and show evidence of partial immune escape from existing vaccines. As the composition of SARs-CoV-2 changes, it is essential we advance new approaches to extend the level of protection that COMIRNATY originally conveyed. In a clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of mono and bivalent Omicron BA.1-modified vaccines administered as a fourth dose in more than 1,900 participants over age 55. We are also evaluating different doses of mono and bivalent BA.1 in participants 18 to 55 years of age. While we saw promising responses to both mono and bivalent versions in the over 55 population, we moved forward with bivalent following guidance from regulators. The BA.1 vaccine candidate elicited a superior immune response for BA.1 compared to the current version of the vaccine. A seroresponse rate which exceeded noninferiority and neutralization activity which increased substantially. The BA.1 vaccine neutralized wild type and Delta similarly to the current version of the vaccine, suggesting the Omicron-modified version maintained responses for the ancestral strain and other variants. Based on these data and following guidance from regulators, we have completed regulatory submissions in Europe, UK and Canada for the 30-microgram bivalent vaccine in individuals 12 and older and plan submissions in other markets soon. The data also showed this vaccine candidate neutralized Omicron BA.4 and BA.5, though to a lesser extent than BA.1. This suggested a need to develop both a BA.1-modified vaccine and a BA.4/5-modified vaccine. We studied BA.4/5 monovalent and bivalent booster candidates in mice and found a substantial increase in neutralization responses to all Omicron variants of concern. Neutralizing titers against BA.4/5 increased 11-fold for the monovalent and 4.8-fold for the bivalent compared to monovalent BA.1 vaccine. These data were shared at the recent FDA advisory committee meeting as a potential surrogate to help expedite development of a BA.4/5 vaccine. We plan to submit the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine candidate for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. in preparation for the fall booster campaign. To adapt more rapidly, we have agreed with FDA that this submission will be based on safety and immunogenicity data generated in adults with an Omicron-modified BA.1 vaccine and supported by BA.4/5 bivalent-specific preclinical data and BA.4/5 bivalent chemistry, manufacturing and controls data. This strategy is bolstered by previous experience showing that overall responses have been similar between human clinical and mouse data, our clinical experience with Beta and Omicron-modified vaccine candidates, and by leveraging our mRNA platform and manufacturing experience for the current vaccine. To support future potential U.S. licensure and global registrations, we plan to initiate a clinical study to evaluate the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine. The clinical study design is under discussion with the FDA. We aspire to continue leading with science and working to identify vaccines that will help provide strong and durable protection as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. We aim to deliver a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that can provide durable antibody and T cell immune protection against severe disease and hospitalization for at least one year. We plan to take a stepwise approach by designing and testing different candidates that engage multiple arms of the immune system including antibodies and T cells. First, yesterday we announced the start of a Phase 2 study evaluating a bivalent modRNA vaccine candidate which consists of RNAs encoding novel enhanced prefusion spike proteins for the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and an Omicron variant. The enhanced spike protein encoded from the mRNAs has been modified with the aim of increasing the magnitude and breadth of antibody neutralization response that could better protect against COVID-19. We project delivering key clinical data this fall. Second, we plan to initiate a proof-of-concept study with a potential pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by the end of the year. This combines the super-stabilized spike sequences with a T-cell enhancing construct, aiming to extend durability of protection against severe disease and new emerging SARs-CoV-2 viral variants. Now turning to PAXLOVID, last month, we submitted a new drug application to the U.S. FDA, seeking approval for the treatment of COVID-19 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated adults and pediatric patients 12 years and over weighing at least 40 kilograms at high risk for progression to severe illness. We anticipate a PDUFA date in the first quarter of 2023. We plan to generate further data in those who are immunocompromised, hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and at increased risk for poor outcomes due to the disease or who are pregnant. We also are considering multiple collaborative studies to evaluate potential treatment for long COVID. Finally, we are working with the FDA to finalize a protocol to study patients who may be in need of retreatment. According to CDC, a brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARSCoV-2 infection in some people. We believe the occurrence of COVID-19 rebound is uncommon and not uniquely associated with any specific treatment. At this time, cases are being reported at a rate consistent with the EPIC-HR trial. Turning now to flu, we know that currently available vaccines are not optimal in addressing the unmet need as each year many people are infected, hospitalized and die, resulting in tremendous public health and economic impact. In part, this is because the flu vaccine development cycle is inefficient and even when current seasonal vaccine strains match circulating strains well, they typically confer only 40% to 60% protection. Potential advantages of the mRNA platform include shortened timelines to enable a quicker response each season, improved strain matching, faster and more reliable manufacturing and broader immune responses from both antibodies and T cells, the latter needed particularly in older adults. Based on our experience with COVID-19, T cell responses appear to be critical for protection against severe disease and hospitalization in infectious viral disease. Here we show Phase 2 T cell data for our quadrivalent mod-mRNA flu vaccine candidate in subjects 65 and older. We believe this is the first evidence of a flu vaccine candidate inducing substantial responses for both CD4 and CD8 T cells. On the left, at day seven the CD4 T cell response was more than two-fold for all four flu strains for our vaccine compared to a current high dose vaccine now recommended in the U.S. for adults 65 and older. Over half of the cohort receiving our vaccine candidate had a more than two-fold response. On the right, at day seven the CD8 T cell response and responder rates were greater for all four strains for our vaccine candidate versus the comparator. Our belief is that these encouraging T cell responses, combined with higher seroconversion rates through A strains which are the most predominant circulating strains and have pandemic potential may translate into improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. Based on these data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 efficacy study this year. We\u2019re excited to share that new data on our oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, two abstracts on twice-daily danuglipron and one on our once-daily candidate known as 1532 have been accepted for the European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference in September. These investigational medicines were designed in-house by Pfizer\u2019s innovative chemistry and discovery teams. In a Phase 1 study in adults with Type 2 diabetes, after only six weeks of treatment, 1532 robustly reduced mean daily glucose to almost near-normal levels. Participants also experienced weight loss of up to 5 kilograms, compared with 2 kilograms for placebo. We believe this to be a potentially best-in-class profile across both injectables and orals. Similar changes in body weight were observed in participants with non-diabetic obesity, 1532 is characterized by favorable once-daily pharmacokinetics, a low risk for drug-drug interactions, robust efficacy across multiple metabolic endpoints and GLP-1 receptor agonist class-like tolerability which overall encouraged us to plan for a Phase 2 study to pick the winning candidate prior to a potential Phase 3 study start. These development programs may lead to potential indications in Type 2 diabetes, obesity, NASH and cardiovascular risk reduction in Type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. Over the 12 past months, we have built a strong inflammation and immunology portfolio with diverse products to help address multiple drivers of disease and unmet need. CIBINQO was approved for atopic dermatitis in adults and last week received priority review designation in the U.S. for adolescents 12 to 18 years. We are nearing a regulatory submission for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis. We have submitted regulatory applications in the U.S., Europe and UK for ritlecitinib for alopecia areata and are awaiting acceptances. We also plan to start a Phase 3 study of ritlecitinib in vitiligo this year. We are pleased to now share promising new updated data from our anti-Interferon beta monoclonal antibody in specialized rheumatology. Patients with dermatomyositis show elevated Type I Interferon gene signature in blood, skin and muscle, correlating with disease activity in skin. As we continue our development of this candidate, a potential breakthrough therapy for hard-to-treat dermatomyositis which attacks the skin and muscles, we believe it may have the ability to address a broader set of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, possibly including polymyositis and lupus. On our third quarter 2021 call, I shared data from our ongoing Phase 2 dermatomyositis study, focused on skin inflammation and showing significant reduction in disease activity when compared with placebo in just three months of treatment. Now both doses met the primary efficacy endpoint in skin predominant disease. The disease also manifests with progressively debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue. Early data suggest that in a small cohort of patients with muscle predominant disease, our candidate resulted in numerically better efficacy scores across all key muscle endpoints including patient-reported outcomes after three weeks. We plan to submit the data for presentation once the study completes. Now, a promising update on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen CD3-targeted bispecific antibody. At ASCO, we presented data from a Phase 1 trial in people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma whose disease is refractory to at least one agent in each of three major classes of medications approved for the disease. We saw a confirmed overall response rate of 64% and 35% of patients achieved stringent complete response or complete response. More than half who received prior BCMA-directed therapy, such as an antibody-drug conjugate or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, achieved a response. Responders\u2019 probability of being event free at nine months was 77%. Elranatamab elicited durable Minimal Residual Disease or MRD negativity meaning no disease was detected after treatment in all evaluable patients who experienced a complete response or stringent complete response. Molecular responses were durable as well with 60% \u2013 62% of those complete responders documented to have MRD negativity at more than six months, including two patients who were MRD negative beyond 18 months. MagnetisMM-1 results, and emerging data from MagnetisMM-3 which is studying triple-class refractory multiple myeloma support further development across a broader program with potential registration enabling studies MagnetisMM-5 in patients with double-class exposed multiple myeloma and MagnetisMM7 in newly diagnosed post-transplant patients with multiple myeloma. There is potential for deep and durable results that can be broadly accessible to patients due to off-the-shelf, subcutaneous, and convenient dosing. The efficacy and safety profile we have seen to date in a challenging patient population supports advancement into earlier lines of treatment. Finally, here is a snapshot of select milestones for this year, showing healthy progress in the pipeline. It was an important quarter for COVID execution, and we look forward to sharing complete readouts from anti-Interferon Beta and the modFlu candidate before the end of the year. Thank you for your attention. Let me turn it over to Dave.\nDave Denton: Thank you, Mikael and good morning, everyone. As this is my first call as CFO, I thought I would set the stage for the next chapter of Pfizer, and our relentless focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Over the past few years, Pfizer\u2019s cash generation capabilities have expanded significantly, and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. It\u2019s clear to me the company is uniquely positioned for growth, and at the same time, enhancing financial returns. And as we look to the future of the company, we are focused on three primary areas to drive significant shareholder value. First and foremost is our continued emphasis and investment in science and innovation. We are investing internally and externally to create breakthrough medicines, deploying more than $50 billion in this area in the past three years alone. Our second priority is maintaining and growing Pfizer\u2019s dividend, paying out more than $25 billion to shareholders over this period. We recognize that our dividend represents an important component of returns for our investors. And finally, from time to time, we will return capital to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases. Over the past three years, the company has allocated nearly $9 billion in this area. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value will be a major focus and I believe all three areas will contribute to our success. More recently, in year to date, we deployed more than $12 billion into innovation, paid dividends of $4.5 billion, and repurchased $2 billion of our shares. This demonstrates an on-going commitment to our robust capital deployment framework. With that now let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I will confine my remarks largely to adjusted and operational growth figures. Turning to the income statement. Revenues increased 53% operationally in the second quarter of 2022. These results were driven by momentum in PAXLOVID sales and strong sales of the COVID-19 vaccine; and underlying strength from a number of our key products. Excluding PAXLOVID and Comirnaty, Biopharma product revenues grew operationally by 2% compared to the prior year. In-line products, Xeljanz and Chantix, were impacted by labelling changes and a global pause in shipments, respectively. While Ibrance continued to transition into a new COVID normal market environment. PC1, our contract manufacturing business, grew 89% operationally in the second quarter 2021, and therefore faced a tough comparison versus last year, with PC1 declining by 25% operationally. And now bringing that together, Pfizer\u2019s non-COVID-related revenues grew by 1% operationally in the second quarter. Adjusted cost of sales dollars grew more slowly than revenues, resulting in gross margin rate expansion of 570 basis points versus the second quarter of LY. This improvement in gross margin is largely attributable to the impact of higher-margin PAXLOVID sales; partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine sales; and the impact of a $450 million write-off of COVID-related inventory that had expired or are expected to expire. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we chose to manufacture and hold excess stock to ensure we could meet global health demand for products if an extreme need were to arise. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the second quarter grew by 7% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and Comirnaty, and higher healthcare reform fees. The 27% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q2 was primarily driven by investments in multiple late-stage clinical programs, including programs to prevent and treat COVID-19, and costs to develop recently-acquired programs. The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter of 15.4% declined by 170 basis points versus last year driven by a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. And as a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.73 grew by 77%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04 grew 92%; on operational basis adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 100% in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results; negatively impacting revenues and adjusted earnings per share by 7% or $0.08 per share. So with that, let\u2019s move to our 2022 guidance. Given our strong second quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year, we are increasing our operational revenue expectations by $2 billion, and operational adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.24. Unfortunately, given additional U.S. dollar strengthening since we last updated guidance in early May, foreign exchange negatively impacts revenues by $2 billion, leaving our reported revenue guidance range unchanged at $98 to $102 billion. This represents an operational growth rate of 29% at the midpoint compared to 2021, a 200 basis point improvement over prior expectations. The improvement in our operational adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook of $0.24 is also negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, compressing EPS by $0.19. The net impact of these cross currents allows the company to raise the low-end of its adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05 to $6.30 to $6.45 a share. This represents 65% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we continue to expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, unchanged compared to our prior guidance provided on May 3, despite the impact of approximately $1 billion of incremental negative foreign exchange. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance unchanged, despite an incremental $300 million headwind due to FX. Our non-COVID-related revenues are absorbing approximately $700 million of impact from negative foreign exchange. Given the seasonality that we expect, I would also like to give you some color on the expected cadence of these COVID-related revenues across the second half. Based on current guidance for Comirnaty, we expect approximately 25% of second half sales in Q3 and 75% of sales in Q4, driven by expected deliveries of Omicron-adapted vaccines in Q4, again subject to regulatory approval. Conversely for PAXLOVID, we expect approximately 60% of sales in Q3 and 40% in Q4.  So, with that, let me give you some detail on changes in our cost and expense guidance. We are decreasing our expected adjusted SI&A spend by $300 million across the range to $12.2 to $13.2 billion. Additionally, we are also increasing our guidance for adjusted R&D expense by $500 million at the low-end only, with the new range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, reflecting incremental investments in multiple programs, including mRNA vaccine programs outside of COVID-19 and other programs. We are also slightly reducing our expected effective tax rate on adjusted income by 50 basis points to approximately 15.5%. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases, beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March 2022. So in closing, it\u2019s an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\nChris Stevo: Thanks, Dave. At this time let\u2019s start the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question per caller. And if you have additional questions we ask you to please get back in the queue and we\u2019ll address as many questions as we have time to do so. And if you have any remaining questions afterwards, the R&D team will be available to answer those questions for you as well. Chelsea, if you could queue up the callers, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question come from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. I appreciate all the disclosures there at the end. But I wanted to follow up on the Comirnaty guide again. Obviously, you had some incremental contracts that got signed since the last time you gave guidance. You highlighted sort of the FX headwind. So I guess trying to tease out exactly kind of \u2013 explicitly kind of what you\u2019re assuming around potentially, I guess, EU doses getting pushed into 2023 and just some additional color there, if you can please. Thank you.\nDave Denton: This is Dave. Carter, this is Dave. Thank you for the question. Let me walk you the guidance for this year from a vaccine perspective. As you well know, we had a guidance of $32 billion to begin with as we entered \u2013 come out of Q1. There\u2019s really three moving parts as I think about our guidance for the year: one is we do have an incremental contract from the USG for 105 million doses this year, which is an uptick to that guidance; Secondly, we\u2019re experiencing headwinds from an FX perspective to the tune of $1 billion since Q1, but for the year, really $2 billion in that product alone; and then third, as I just articulated, the cadence of deliveries in the back half is really skewed to Q4. And with that, some ex-U.S. deliveries could move from November into December of the calendar year. And if that were to occur, given our one month lag from a reporting perspective that would fall \u2013 those revenues would fall into Q1 of 2023. I do not know whether that\u2019s going to happen, but I\u2019m planning that it might happen. So therefore, I\u2019m probably being conservative in my approach, in my outlook to the revenue guide for that specific medicine.\nChris Stevo: Okay, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next questions come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Thanks for taking my question and all the color on the call today. I guess mine is on PAXLOVID. And maybe you could talk a little bit about I know there, while you said there\u2019s low rate in line with clinical trials for rebounding, maybe that\u2019s under reported and you outlined your plan for new trials. What are you doing to potentially decrease that potential for rebounding in the new studies? Are you extending and doubling the dose? And maybe some trends a couple, give us more color on some trends that you\u2019re seeing on PAXLOVID. I know you mentioned globally. We\u2019re hearing in some states it\u2019s more limited versus others. Maybe just give us more color there on trends you\u2019re seeing on access? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Sure. William why don\u2019t you speak a little bit about the program, what we haven\u2019t rebounding? And then Angela, you speak a little bit about the trend of the revenues in the uptake.\nWilliam Pao: Sure. Thanks, Albert, and thanks for the question. So as we reported earlier in the EPIC-HR study, we did see a single agent percent of potential rebound. But we also saw it in the placebo arm with a very similar rate. Since then we have seen other studies coming out including from the Mayo Clinic, Case Western, and Kaiser Permanente and others showing data that\u2019s very consistent with ours in terms of single-digit percent of rebound. And it\u2019s also been seen not only with placebo, but also with competitor antivirals. And internally, we also have data from real-world data, as well as additional pharmacovigilance data showing again that it\u2019s a very similar low percentage rate of recurrence. That said, though we are working with the FDA to finalize plans for a trial in which we would treat such patients and we\u2019re still deciding on the final outline of that. And in addition as Mikael outlined, we\u2019ll be looking at other cohorts of patients, for example, immunocompromised patients who have a large unmet medical need. And in that setting, we will be looking at, for example, five days, 10 days and 15 days of dosing to determine the optimum dose regimen for those patients.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, William. And I need to say that we are very serious about PAXLOVID and we are looking very diligently. All the anecdotal reports that are coming, but all the data, I repeat all the data, our internal data, but we are detecting rebounds by proactively checking viral loads or the external data that have been reported through pharmacovigilance to us, or through studies that have been performed by third parties, very reputable third parties like Kaiser Permanente and or Mayo Clinic. They are consistent that this is low single-digit, actually less than 1% in the external studies. And it was as repeated around 2% in the methodology we used in ours and very consistent with the numbers of the placebo. So although we try to see if there is a need to do something about it, seriously, we can\u2019t find any data set other than anecdotal reports. Also, I want to emphasize that even the anecdotal reports, they are all indicating that it is a mild. So we don\u2019t have any rebound that it is more serious, right? And clearly, we haven\u2019t identified any single case that we have resistance to the PAXLOVID. So we are looking into it. And William said that we are going to run also some studies we\u2019re discussing our protocols with FDA to see if treatment of those cases could help. But so far our conclusion, although we are looking a lot, it is very small percentage similar to COVID placebo or COVID other antivirals, and with very mild symptoms. Angela, what about the trends internationally and in the U.S., if you want.\nAngela Hwang: So globally, I think that we\u2019re doing really well and we\u2019re making excellent progress. We have made and manufactured 30 million doses, and we delivered 23.5 million of those doses. So I think that the contracting is going well. The demand and expectations for the need for PAXLOVID is definitely up there. But maybe let me use some U.S. examples where things are - where we have a little bit more data and where things I think are going particularly well. The U.S. actually contracted a 10.8 million doses with us so far and 7.4 million doses of all of those have already been allocated to all the states. So I think that gives you a sense of how much demand is coming in from all of the states, and then every single week, our utilization of PAXLOVID has also increased. In fact, most recently we hit an all-time high of 389,000 doses or doses of PAXLOVID that were used in just in one week. So that gives you a sense of sort of the increase and the momentum. What\u2019s really driving this is, obviously, the education and the familiarity and the experience now of physicians, as well as patients. But also the excellent work that is being done at the federal, as well as the state level \u2013 at the state level in terms of education and utilization. And I want to call out in particular, the test-to-treat program that I think has been particularly effective and very positive. To date, more than 41,000 pharmacies are now test-to-treat centers. And that means that that just gives access to a tremendous amount of the population to be able to access PAXLOVID. And also recently pharmacists are now able to prescribe PAXLOVID within certain limitations. And over and above whatever states and the federal government are doing Pfizer is also aggressively and assertively supporting education. So actually, we have leveraged the entire Pfizer field force to provide education, we\u2019re running webinars. And to date, we\u2019ve reached over 300,000 healthcare professionals, as well as 80,000 pharmacists just to give you a sense of the extent and the breadth of reach that we have accomplished. And all of that and also complemented by public service announcements about driving awareness of the treatment, but also the individual risk that each patient could carry and making them aware that they could be a potential candidates for PAXLOVID. So I think with all of these efforts that have gone on and that we\u2019re continuing, we feel really good about the momentum of PAXLOVID, the utilization of PAXLOVID, and the benefit that PAXLOVID can bring, particularly in a time when there\u2019s surges going on around the entire world.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Robyn. Next question, please Chelsea?\nOperator: Your next questions come from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had a two part one on your mRNA seasonal flu vaccine program. I was just wondering if you had any HAI titer data that you can share from the trial. We saw the CD \u2013 the T-cell data, but again, wondering if there\u2019s any titer data you can share? And then anything on the safety tolerability there, is it fair to assume that the profile is similar to Comirnaty or are there any particular differences you\u2019d like to call out? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much Terence. Mikael, why don\u2019t you take this question?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. We will share details in upcoming conference, but I can just give a little bit more color. As you know, the highest medical burden and hospitalization of cures in the 65 plus were the A strains are the most dominant. We had very strong titers against the A strains and exceeding what you would see with the current recommended vaccines. So we are very bullish about our ability with mRNA to induce both strong antibody response and CD4 and CD8 T cells, which are not in used by current standard of care. And this is the reason why we are sharing today that we are announcing to Phase 3 study.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Terence. Next question, please.\nMikael Dolsten: Tolerability, sorry. Tolerability of this 30 microgram, sorry, Terence. I didn\u2019t note that first. Tolerability is of course supported by our billion of doses of the platform in COVID. And on top of that in older adults, the 30 microgram have a very good acceptance, the main patient group. And I believe it\u2019s going to be excellent and very similar to other available flu vaccines.\nAlbert Bourla: And also Mikael, you spoke about A, you didn\u2019t speak about the B strains in the immunogenicity as they were similar to the current high dose of quadrivalent. [Ph]\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. I didn\u2019t mention the B strains. We noted in general, lower response to B strains with both standard of care. And we edged on the lower side with our vaccine. That\u2019s why I was so encouraged to see the unique T cell response against the B cell strain and the total of that data make us encouraged that we will have a strong product for both A and B.\nAlbert Bourla: And then they think how confident we feel it is that although the regulatory pathway, it is just demonstrate non-inferiority in immunogenicity, we are going for an efficacy trial. So the trial that is we announced yesterday is going to measure real efficacy in flu, which we believe that we expect of course science is unpredictable, but we expect to win with flying colors. Let\u2019s go to the next one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question and a clarification. The questions on PAXLOVID. I know the test-to-treat program from the Biden administration is going to bake driver volumes. And my question is how would the demand dynamics change when we transition to a commercial purchasing model? And let\u2019s say the test-to-treat is still in place, would that \u2013 would there be any change or not? And my clarification is Mikael, I think some comments you might have made at a recent non transcripted meeting on the TL1A program, and whether there\u2019s been a signal consistent across the Phase 2a and Phase 2b, could you please clarify that? Thank you very much. And I\u2019m referring to the interim analysis that happened recently.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Angela, what do you think if we go to open commercial market? Do you think that we will be better or worse off for PAXLOVID?\nAngela Hwang: Yes. So I think that there are elements that we will be able to implement in the commercial market that currently that we don\u2019t. So for sure, you\u2019ve just heard me share comments about the efforts that we\u2019ve put into PAXLOVID already here in the U.S. and ex-U.S., right? The execution and the support of education support of our entire field forces, support of retail, support of patients through education again, and PSAs. Now, all that will continue, but I think what happens in a full commercial launch is that you will have multiple distributors and multiple points of distribution throughout the entire country. You will have stocking by every pharmacist, pharmacy, and pharmacist and various points of use. And so I think that in a commercial setting actually, you\u2019ll be able to reach a much broader set of channels that we currently even do today. So I think that\u2019s one difference. I think, the second difference is that what you can do from a commercial perspective will also look different. Remember today we\u2019re under an EUA and while we can do a lot of education, key things like sampling cannot be done in an EUA. So that\u2019s going to be an example of another difference that will happen post EUA. And then I think finally even if you think about consumer education, today we\u2019ve really limited ourselves to unbranded and sort of disease awareness education, but again in a commercial setting, you could support through branded education and talk a lot more about the product. And so all of these are things that actually Pfizer does and the commercial organization of Pfizer does really well. This is our sweet spot. So I think that we look forward to building on top of what the government has been doing, which has been really excellent and building on top of that to do more and to support greater initiatives across the country.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. Well said. What about TL1A Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Briefly, this is our internally discovered antibody against TL1A, a member of the TNF superfamily that is associated with inflammatory diseases. Yes, we had consistent, robust efficacy for all come you see patients and very strong efficacy consistent across the trial for a prospectively defined precision biomarker. Tolerability was very good. Now this is induction data, and later this year, we will have maintenance data and as we get those data set, we will decide about next step.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Let\u2019s go to the next call.\nOperator: Your next question come from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the early oral GLP-1 data, especially for once daily. My question is how much incremental data we are going to see in September from the one you presented today and also how soon can you move this agent into bigger trials? And how do you see the biggest differentiation versus the oral semaglutide at this point? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael, maybe also could take that question.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. We are very excited about this new data set [indiscernible] that you will see at EASD Meeting in Stockholm in September, there will be additional data. And I think you will find HbA1c very encouraging, although this was a short study. I think, compared to oral semaglutide, the differentiation is substantial. This is a true small molecule that can be given. So once a day, it\u2019s completely independent on fasting or meal concordance. And I think you will be able to reach higher effects on both glucose as well as on weight reduction. As I reported now, we were almost at 100 mg/dL reduction over four to six week and five kilogram. And we haven\u2019t yet optimized the titration to even higher doses. So we are very encouraged of what we see we going to share with regulators soon, our next trial set and move swiftly to allow us to pick the winner and the regimen for a potential Phase 3 study to come after the Phase 2b.\nMohit Bansal: Thank you, Mikael.\nAlbert Bourla: And also to add that this is for us clearly high priority project. We have a designation within the company what we call the Lightspeed project, project of significant value to patients and as a result also significant economic value where we give this designation and we move them with a speed of light and we overinvest to make sure that we derisk and we move fast. And I review personally on a biweekly \u2013 on the bimonthly basis, the progress of this program. So that is going to be one of them. Thank you very much. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is come from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: Hello, thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. I would love for your perspective on the provision for Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers a part of the now coined Inflation Reduction Act that we have press reports \u2013 reporting deal between Manchin and Schumer. And what kind of \u2013 what's the potential long-term impact on your R&D and innovation? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. I'm disappointed with what I'm reading in the newspapers. Of course, we can't know exactly what will happen because we have seen that this situation is very volatile, but everything that they are reporting they are going to implement a pride setting in reality it is not a price negotiation because they're forcing their will by implementing a 95% tax, according to previous guidance that will cause the industry significant. We estimate that 270 billion over 10 years. There is a positive provision there, but they're reducing the out of pocket cost for the patients. That's a significant one, but it's too little and too late. They could do way more because that will cost them 10% of the 270 billions, but they're going to collect. They are basically not doing that to alienate patient's costs because they could give all the money and then made significant, significant difference with the patient. They're just giving a part of that and they won't even to start it for understood well from year 2025. So although that out of pocket is a very positive provision, but the rest one is a provision that I think will force the industry to reduce R&D if it goes the way that they are suggesting. So other than that, I don't have anything to add. We will wait to see how the \u2013 what exactly in reality that means and we'll go from there. And also I want to say it is very disappointing that they're choosing to single out one industry everything in this bill, from what I understand [indiscernible] is affecting everyone, but then there are specific measures to affect only the pharma industry, particularly when we are out of the pandemic or this industry has proven the value that brings to public health and to the global economy. We would be in a very different point in this global economy if we didn't have the investments and the thriving life sciences sector. And they are choosing to single out this industry I think is wrong and I hope that the reason will prevail when this discussions goes to Congress. Let's move to the next question please.\nOperator: Your next questions come from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question here. Just curious if some of the setbacks that we've seen in the CD47 space changed your view on the market opportunity for your Trillium asset. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Why don't we go to William?\nWilliam Pao: Yes, sure. So thanks for the question, Louise. So we saw the news the other day. Internally, we remain confident in our program with Trillium and we proceed with the programs that we are planning and we'll let the data speak for itself when they come out.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much and congratulations on the performance. I wanted to ask a little bit about VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX. The performance was below our and consensus expectations. If you could speak to that and also talk about the sequential prospects going forward i.e., has the product peaked out in the U.S. and how should we think about future prospects relative to the sales that you booked? Thank you very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, David. Angela, what do you think?\nAngela Hwang: Well, we continue to be really pleased with how VYNDAQEL is doing. If you look at just from a diagnosis perspective, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, we continue to do a really great job of effectively finding and identifying who that ATTR-CM patients are diagnosing them and then bringing them on to therapies. So in this quarter we have reached an all time high over 40% diagnosis rate. And I think that this is well beyond what we thought we would be able to do in the timeframe that we have had. So we continue to believe in the growth that this product has. The real world data that has been generated now and the overall survival benefits are really compelling. And the fact that we are the only product being able to demonstrate these benefits, I think speaks well to how we'll continue to be able to build in this market despite competition that will arise. I think what you're referring to in terms of the impact and the expectations really is a one-time effect in and it was in Japan. And this was a very specific price decrease that was planned and driven by regulation. When VYNDAQEL was launched in Japan, again based on pricing regulation in the country, that was specific to the country, it was much higher price than any other country we had. And so by regulation, again, it's the 75% price decrease that we're seeing is a function of that. But the underlying growth of VYNDAQEL in Japan is really strong. We had just in the first half of 2022, 69% volume growth. We had 32% year-over-year of new patient starts. So, hopefully, this gives you a sense that the net revenue impacts you see are, in fact, not a reflection of the demand and the true underlying demand, whether it's in the U.S. or ex-U.S.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Thank you, Angela. Thank you, David. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Well, thank you. A question on your RSV vaccine. There doesn't seem to be anything, but a brief mention of the program in the press release or the slides, and really nothing in prepared remarks that we have Phase 3 data results coming out very soon, I'm wondering why. But really my main question is why you recently changed the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 trial, including downsizing of the trial. And that comes on top of the delay in readout as announced earlier this year. And if I can slip one in on your quadrivalent mRNA flu, when would we likely see results from your Phase 3 that you're starting up?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Mikael, both questions goes to you. I think the first question thing was for RSV, right? Yes.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. We have made a great progress in the RSV adult file. As you know, we ran it through two different seasons in the northern and southern hemisphere to make sure we had good patient experience and cases. Things are looking good for a readout that would come soon. I remain very positive about RSV adult based on our Phase 2 challenge data that was stellar and the role this particular entity and that we're targeting play unless we are the only one that are targeting the two forms of this perfusion. You also asked about modRNA flu. Yes, as Albert mentioned, we are going big here with an efficacy study. We are enquired about the data we're seeing. We think it's a unique dataset. And we plan to soon embark on our Phase 3 after proper dialogue with regulators. Of course, this is an event trial, but if the season is robust, which you can never know, we would expect the Phase 3 to readout next year.\nAlbert Bourla: Exactly. And also, I'm sorry if we gave the impression that RSV is not important to us. It's extremely important. There is no better good news. This is why we didn't mention it much, but still remains the very good news. But the previous studies were extremely strong and that the current studies are progressing very well. So we have very high confidence, absent a surprise, but we will launch next year, very robust product, both in adults and in maternal \u2013 the maternal whereas both studies are progressing very well. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question is come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just had a couple on PAXLOVID real quick. Can you give us an update on the number of countries you're in contract discussions with I'm just thinking relative to the start of the year? And then related what's been the biggest contributor of supply expansion in 2Q? And when do you think you guys will be fully, fully normalized? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Let's go to Angela for the number of countries and where we are with that.\nAngela Hwang: Yes. So we are in contract with a significant number of countries at this point, maybe I can talk about it from a dose perspective. So more than 35 million treatment courses have already been contracted with a number of countries and this is what we publicly disclosed. There are additional doses that I can't talk about because either the country didn't want us to disclose them publicly or we're in the middle of negotiations with them. So I think to answer your question since we last left off, we have made progress with our contracting. I think what's \u2013 maybe what's more important to clarify is just that the approach that countries are taking to contract with us is just really different to where we were in Comirnaty. In Comirnaty, they were interested in securing large amounts of doses upfront, but that's in fact not the case here in PAXLOVID. And the reason being that number one, they're being prudent with how they are ordering. And they're able to do that because they know that we have the manufacturing capacity and that we can pivot as we need. They will \u2013 the countries are also trying to manage inventory and not to have too much aged product lying around. And so I think that this is what's driving the more smaller more frequent contracting rather than big, big contracts that like you saw in Comirnaty. The other thing I will also say is, and the reason why I'm talking in doses rather than specific countries is because we're also working with supranational organizations, who are acting on behalf of multiple countries. So think Global Fund, think UNICEF, these are \u2013 in addition to the bilaterals there are also important organizations who are helping us to supply and bring doses into the countries. So I think all in all great progress, and I think you should expect to see that this is one of these things will \u2013 that will just keep inching away because of how countries want to manage the inventory and the supply.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. And also to \u2013 because you had also question on supplier above, we have done tremendous, tremendous progress on that field. Actually, we have been able to reduce dramatically the lead time, so how much time it's needed for manufacturing and to have improved dramatically our yields. So supply is not an issue, actually removed almost everything in-house now in terms of API and finished product. Thank you very much. Next, go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next questions come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions, just one follow up on the PAXLOVID comments. As we move, I guess, from some of these large government orders that was out of the U.S., et cetera earlier this year to maybe these more kind of on-demand smaller contracts. How do we think about what the impact that has on pricings? I think that you were giving some volume based discounts before. And just help us, I guess, as we think about kind of 2023 and beyond what pricing does for that business. And then kind of the bigger question I had was just on Ibrance dynamics. I think you mentioned in the prepared marks, you're seeing signs of a recovery for your business there. I am just interested in how you're kind of seeing the balance of just overall market dynamics relative the competitive landscape with obviously competitors with an adjuvant indication? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: So thank you very much. Chris, we do not provide, let's say, forward-looking projections on pricing and particularly every time I speak about pricing is becoming big news. So I want to make sure that we respect that. I know what you are asking and I can give a very high level answer. Clearly, we are providing special pricing when we are contracting very, very big quantities with governments. That's also the incentive for the government to buy big quantities because the price is really, really very attractive. If we move to normal market, the prices would reflect both in vaccines and in antivirals, the prices of similar value, similar technology products that they are out there. Clearly, also when you move to private to commercial markets, the complexities are getting way, way higher. We will need to go to single doses in the vaccines, so manufacturing complexities are very higher. We need to have distribution to small distribution centers, including physician offices. So all of that creates a very big complexity, but also could be taken into consideration as we price our products at that time. And I want to emphasize that also those present significant opportunities for us because the open market it is way more complex, way more diverse to have millions of customers rather than one or two and displays our strengths in terms of having global presence or within the U.S. a dramatic presence in every single territory of the country with thousands of people that they are calling physicians, hospitals, accounts \u2013 in payers accounts, et cetera, et cetera. So it's something that if we see a turn into this market also we would see us being able to compete more of a position of strength than now. As we get to Ibrance, Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Well, as you say, the metastatic breast cancer CDK4/6 market is incredibly competitive yet. I will emphasize that Ibrance continues to be the leading CDK4/6 inhibitor. In fact, we have a 74% market share across all patients in first line therapy. So I \u2013 and I think that this number has been pretty consistent because we talk about it every quarter. And I think it demonstrates just the tremendous experience that physicians and patients have and the confidence they have in Ibrance despite new competition, the patient experience, the fact that we have real-world clinical evidence. All of this really adds to the confidence that we have in this brand. And even though Ibrance is a mature brand, we do continue to see growth and where the growth will come from \u2013 from the following places. You're going to see growth from the CDK class. You're going to see growth from the recovery of new patient starts, which as you know has not recovered to the levels of the \u2013 of prior to the pandemic, as well as stabilization of the PAP through time when economic conditions improve. And I actually want to make a special point of this class growth because therein lies, I think, a tremendous opportunity for all of us. Today, well, last year, this time, the CDK class was 48% in first line metastatic breast cancer use. This quarter, it was 54%. So even though it's grown, that still means that the majority of the time CDKs are not being used. And I think all of us in this class really need to focus on this as the leading priority in helping to grow each of our brands, but also to grow the class to impact patient outcome.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank Angela. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next questions come from the line of Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. First a quick word of welcome and appreciation to David for your proactive commentary on the facing of revenues. It really mirrors what your predecessor hit off and finally referred to as the rhythm of the numbers. Very helpful to get insights on near term factors that are generating push-pulls on those numbers. My question is on business development. However, I'm not sure that Aamir has joined us, but perhaps if you could update us on your latest thoughts, the teams in terms of how you're feeling about areas of focus, particularly in view of recent broader commentary, for instance, from the FTC, taking a look at competitive dynamic there? And then secondly, as you reflect upon the overall ecosystem and the receptivity, given things like lowered relatively speaking, biotech valuations, are you sensing any shifts or trends or changes in the mindset of potential targets, partners, acquirers? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Aamir is here. And he will be happy to speak about it. Aamir?\nAamir Malik: Chris, thank you for the question. Let me just start with your specific FTC point. I think we've demonstrated a very strong track record of shepherding our transactions to-date through the regulatory process. And that's been largely built on having just a close successful, constructive, and collaborative relationships with regulatory bodies globally. In addition, our business development focus and I'll recap, our priorities in a second, is focus on how do we use our unique abilities to translate emerging science into breakthrough medicine. So most of the deals that we do are pro-patient and they're pro-innovation. So we're confident that we can continue to advance our BD strategies in a successful way. We've been very clear that our goal is to add $25 billion of risk adjusted revenue by 2030. And I think we are making very good progress against that. This year you saw our transaction with ReViral and subsequently with Biohaven, which respectively we believe have the potential to add $1.5 billion and $6 billion in peak sales to our business. And this was on the back of a very active 2021. And going forward, we're leaving very few stones unturned when we look at opportunities and our focus is going to be consistent. It's on scientific substrate that has the potential breakthrough for patients, deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade, and then opportunities where we can add substantial value, whether that's through our scientific chops and/or our commercial capabilities. And we're going to be very open to deal structures. And we've said before, we're also going to be agnostic to size. We've been clear about the fact that cost synergy driven deals are not where our focus is going to be, and we're going to be extremely disciplined. I think we're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us and the flexibility that our balance sheet gives us to pursue those. And on your question on valuation fluctuations, those market valuation fluctuations are not going to drive RBD strategy. We're going to remain focused on fundamentals in the way that I described.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. And it's very important when we are aiming very high to also be able at the same time to be disciplined. Disciplined in valuing the science and paying the right price for the right science, so that the capital that we will dispose will be maximized in producing value for patients and holders. So we grow very big $25 billion, but as we are proving, we are very, very disciplined in how we are allocating our capital. And we will continue doing that. With that, let's go to the next question. Thank you, Aamir.\nOperator: Your next questions come from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. Two part question, please. Your former Head of Vaccines is now in [indiscernible] your competitor GSK when he top line the recent positive Phase 3 data for their RSV vaccine Canada, which is adjuvant data observation he made was he stressed the same level of efficacy in the older patient cohort than in the younger patient cohort. It's possible to imagine that this may be uniquely related to the adjuvant that they have given The immunosenescence of the aging population's T-cell given your vaccine does not have an adjuvant and give background. Is that a concern particularly over follow long years, follow up? And then second just following up on the question on Ibrance, could you think talk to your Arvinas compound ARV-471, we come up with market shares, which are materially lower than yours. But whatever the number is, it's clearly reducing quite significantly as competition builds momentum in the market. How do you thinking about as you transition this drug into Phase 3, both what combinations you're going to run and what are you going to use as the control arm for the combination of a plus a CDK4/6?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Andrew. Just to make a correction. It was not the Head of our Vaccines that joined was another member of the vaccines team, but by no means was correct. Let's move to Mikael.\nMikael Dolsten: Yeah. I am very optimistic about our RSV vaccine construct. We have seen high immune titer that are critical for the vaccine across all ages. In fact, we are the only one that have showed cross strain A and B for RSV, the ReViral high titers, which differ between all the vaccines, including the one that you mentioned, because they mainly measure cross activity from A to B strain. So that was supported also by our challenge data that looked formidable. So while nobody can predict exactly outcome of studies and compare one study to another, we remain very bullish that our bivalent vaccine should stand out in performance and in tolerability. Please note some of the arguments, including the one that you referred to often associated with somewhat unpleasant side effects. And that was one part of our differentiation to achieve with the bivalent, very high data is far and with best in class tolerability.\nAlbert Bourla: And what about Ibrance?\nMikael Dolsten: The ARV-471, I can only speak about the science here, that we see that drug being active in several lines as by itself best-in-class estrogen receptor PROTAC. And we are going to set up our studies in a patient population, which contains many estrogen receptor mutants, which often are poorly managed by the current available fulvestrant or other sides. And we think this is a unique opportunity. And number two, the drugs seem to combine very well with our own CDK4/6 drugs, and we think it could advance into early metastatic lines and possible over time, even to early breast cancer, maybe they're combined with our CDK4. So we have very high hopes for that class of drugs ARV-47 1 combined with our pipeline. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Anything to add William?\nWilliam Pao: Yeah, I would just add as you mentioned Mikael, the preclinical data shows that the protein degradation could be superior to selective estrogen receptor integrators. And so we're very excited about this potential to be superior to search that are being developed.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you from your lips to gut ears. Also, I want to add on the RSV, because it's the second question that came and maybe gave the impression that we are not very hot on it. We are extremely hot on it. Clearly very important product for us, clearly very important product for GSK. So there will be a lot of speculation. Maybe the other one will do that, or maybe the other thing will do this. I think data will speak on the cells with the totality of data available so far that I have seen. We have higher reasons to believe we are better, but you never know before the end of the trials. But right now with all-in-all looks like we have very, very strong profile with all the data that has seen so far. We are waiting a lot with a lot of excitement to underlying data and see the realities. And then of course the best will win. Next move now to Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you so much. I would just like to understand more deeply Pfizer's thinking on Factor XI. I could think of three possibilities. First Pfizer believes there are simply no room to improve upon Eliquis. Second Pfizer believes Factor XI could be very useful, but you haven't found the ideal candidate or third, Pfizer is not sure the jury's still out. Any thoughts?\nAlbert Bourla: I think we have answered it before, and maybe Mikael also can give some color because it's a very, very good question. But bottom line is we are looking for science that it could provide hope that we can have something better than Eliquis and we haven't found yet. So that's the reality. According to our opinion, there is not much maturity right now to overcome the brilliant, the very good profile of Eliquis. Mikael anything to add that simple as that?\nMikael Dolsten: I think you said it very well, in the atrial fib platlet inhibitor and ASI are going to be genericized Eliquis and Rivaroxaban, great drugs, Eliquis being a market leader Factor X inhibitor or by the time Factor XI comes to market close to, or already generalized. So the room for an expensive drug in an area with this many great treatments that requires tremendously high R&D expense coming off the patients have consumed multiple great drugs. For us doesn't look like the best area to deploy capital. We always wish other would like for the benefit of patients.\nAlbert Bourla: Yep. Thank you. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Your final question will come from the line of Elliott Bosco with UBS.\nElliott Bosco: Hi, this is Elliott Bosco from UBS on for Colin Bristow. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a few on PAXLOVID. You mentioned countries needing to manage broader supply. Do you think that current PAXLOVID use trends will result in excess inventory versus what has been contractually purchased? And additionally, could you comment on the recent Codexis retainer arrangement and how we should think about that with regard to 2023 PAXLOVID demand? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. I think that the way we are manufacturing PAXLOVID with of course, great knowledge from our prior experiences with COMIRNATY, but also in terms of our negotiations and discussions with countries is actually allowing us to do supply planning very well. So we are manufacturing as we need and according to the contracts and according to the demand that the countries are providing us. So I think we're doing that in a very prudent and in a very \u2013 in a prudent and an effective way. So I didn't \u2013 we didn't your second question?\nAlbert Bourla: Yeah. What was the second question? I'm not sure.\nElliott Bosco: Codexis, the enzyme supplier for PAXLOVID.\nAlbert Bourla: It was the \u2013 you want to speak, I did refer to it, but maybe also you can yeah reiterate it David.\nDave Denton: Yeah. I think Albert indicated this earlier in his remarks, is that in fact over the last several quarters, we've improved our manufacturing process, reduced the cycle time and importantly improved the yield from an output perspective. So therefore we don't need as much raw materials and API to produce the same amount of finished goods. And then finally we've actually invested in our network to make sure that we can actually produce some API as well. So we're in good shape.\nAlbert Bourla: Is what I said before. We are moving most of it now, because we could way faster than what we anticipated, move it inside. So that created some cancellation of raw materials to some external suppliers. I'm sorry about that. I think that was the last question. Let me close with a few takeaways. The first one, as you see, we continue to deliver strong operational performance. We increased our full year 2022 operational financial forecast, while maintaining it challenging for an extension environment. So I think few companies likely will be able to do that. We believe we are well positioned not only to maintain, but also to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. It will be for us very important focus. And we believe that the medical need will be there for the years to come. That's why we're investing so heavily. We continue focus on driving long-term shareholder returns by remaining very disciplined both on our operations and our incremental capital deployment, you saw even in this quarter but even more we are squeezing our administrative expenses our SMA is going down. And then we reinvest in R&D because we have programs that we are starting, that we feel is a very good return on our investment. And we continue to advance our internal scientific pipeline while executing against our previously announced plans to potentially add at least $25 billion of risk adjusted revenues through business development opportunities from 2030 comply. Just I want very quickly to see that these results in our yielding curve, this efforts in our year-end results. Just to mention few of the potential approvals and launches that we're going to have in the next few months. CIBINQO, we expect to launch the adolescence in next year. And of course next year will be very first year where we expect to have full access for this drug. We expect to launch next year, RSV maternal. We expect to launch next year RMV adults. We expect to launch next year, Prevnar 20 for pediatrics. We expect to launch next year, Elranatamab for triple class refractory myeloma. We expect to launch next year, Ritlecitinib for atopic. We expect to launch next year TRUMENBA, our meningococcal vaccine. We expect to launch next year Talapro for prostate cancer metastatic castrations with patients. We expect to launch Myfembree for endometriosis. And then a little bit later, we expect maybe this in 2023 or beginning of 2024 DMD and through mRNA. So this is the organic, I'm not referring to the Biohaven that is coming and to other molecules I'm referring mainly to the organically developed pipeline assets. I don't think that much of that has been a factor into what some of the analysts are projecting. That's why I'm emphasizing them so that they can pay a little bit more attention. Those are very high probability of success. The ones that I mentioned they are not in the pocket clearly all of them, and some clearly might not make it to the cross-line, but we believe they're seriously de-risked all of that. So with that in mind, I'm really looking forward to have a 6% CAGR by 2025 in our business as we promised in 2019. In fact, year-to-date, we are at 6% excluding BD and excluding COVID. And I think we will do that by 2025, we will maintain this 6% CAGR and we will do more by BD that with are right now implementing. So I think we have a very good growth prospect, and we will maintain our leadership in comp. Thank you very, very much for your interest. And for those that have summer vacations yet, enjoy your summer vacations.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Pfizer's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I am proud to say that Pfizer continued to deliver strong operational performance in the second quarter and has increased its full year 2022 operational financial forecasts for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per shares, all while operating in a challenging foreign exchange environment. Compared with the second quarter of 2021, global revenues were up 53% operationally to $27.7 billion and adjusted diluted EPS increased 100% operationally to $2.04. Both results exceeded consensus analyst expectations, and the quarterly revenue figure represented the largest in Pfizer's history. Key growth drivers for the quarter included PAXLOVID, Comirnaty, Eliquis and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax globally, and our Prevnar family of products in the U.S. Year-to-date, we have reached an estimated 845 million patients around the world with our innovative medicines and vaccines, which represents a 77% increase from the prior-year period. And we did all this while also taking steps to help address broader issues impacting global health, including climate change, equitable access and the war in Ukraine. So, where do we go from here? After two-and-a-half long years, like everyone else, we would hope that this global health crisis would be over soon. But as much as hope is important, hope is not science. And science is telling us that COVID-19 likely will remain a major global healthcare concern for years to come. We believe that Pfizer is well positioned not only to maintain but to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. In terms of our commercial leadership, we believe Pfizer's skills are even better suited for operating in open markets than they are for government-contracting markets and will be even more competitive when this transition happens. Recently, Angela announced a new commercial structure that prepares us to provide even better support for the ongoing Comirnaty and PAXLOVID revenue streams.  In terms of our scientific leadership, we expect to further enhance our position through the continued introduction of new innovations, including preparation for new variants of concern and potentially improving the durability of protection. So far, we have been fortunate that most of the variants have led to less severe illness, but there remains the possibility that a future variant could emerge that combines Omicron's contagiousness with the original virus's severity. This is a scenario no one wants to imagine, but one for which we need to be prepared why we're doing all these investments. That's why also it is critical that Pfizer continues to invest in the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. With this context as a backdrop, let me provide an update on our current COVID-19 offerings and then continue with other products. I will start with Comirnaty. To date, we have shipped more than 3.6 billion doses of our vaccine to 180 countries and territories around the world. Comirnaty remains the most utilized COVID-19 vaccine in the markets in which we operate that report market share data. Pfizer's cumulative share of doses administered in these markets have increased from 52% in January of this year to 63% in July of this year. In developed markets, our share has increased from 59% to 68% over that same time period. Next, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of vaccine boosters for the fall. Outside the U.S., global regulators have issued guidance to advance an Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine candidate to help address the continued evolution of the virus. As such, Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted data to the European Medicines Agency on the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity for the company's bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccine candidate. We also continue to work with health authorities around the globe on regulatory submissions. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration recently asked biopharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop a modified vaccine containing an Omicron BA.4/BA.5 component and we begin clinical trials with these vaccine candidates. Pfizer is currently proceeding with development of a COVID-19 bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 booster vaccine candidate and is targeting this fall for rollout in the U.S., subject of course to regulatory authorization. Pfizer is well positioned to satisfy its current contractual obligations and potential demand within its production capacity through the end of the year. Because of our robust manufacturing capabilities, we are planning to deliver both variant vaccines in the fall, pending regulatory approvals. Turning to PAXLOVID, we continue to be very pleased with how things are progressing in the U.S. as we are seeing several initiatives supporting increased access for eligible patients. First, the number of facilities with PAXLOVID, the supply have continued to increase with more than 41,000 sites live as of July 15, an increase of more than 7,000 sites since early May. We are pleased with the FDA's July 6 revision of the Emergency Use Authorization for PAXLOVID that authorized state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe the treatment under certain conditions, thereby expanding access for patients. As you can see on this slide, we have seen a nearly five-fold increase in PAXLOVID utilization since the first quarter. We also continue to retain greater than 90% market share of oral COVID-19 treatments in the U.S. and are taking a state-by-state approach to engaging key government officials to discuss their access strategies. We are also continuing to work with states to educate consumers, healthcare providers and pharmacists about the importance of treating all appropriate high-risk patients rather than limiting treatment to the severely immunocompromised and unvaccinated. In spite of the strong growth, we have seen in PAXLOVID uptake in the U.S. due to our and the government's efforts, we estimate that a significant amount of eligible patients outside the U.S. are not yet being treated with the drug and may not know they are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. So, we believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow PAXLOVID utilization. For international developing markets, we are seeing significant increases in usage across many markets, reflecting the recent wave of BA.4/BA.5 and resulting increases in hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths. For example, over the month from June 24 to July 24, average daily deaths in Europe almost doubled from a low of 0.6 per 1 million people to 1.15 per 1 million; in Japan, they almost tripled from 0.12 per 1 million people to 0.34 per 1 million; and in Australia, they increased from 1.78 per 1 million people to 2.59 per 1 million. While we have less precise numbers on market shares outside the U.S., our internal estimates indicate that we saw an estimated 116% increase in usage between June 24 and July 15 across international developed markets where we have supply agreements. So, we believe there is a significant opportunity to continue the growth outside the U.S. as physicians become more knowledgeable about PAXLOVID and treat appropriate patients. While COVID-19 remains top of mind for many people, we are seeing encouraging performance with some of our other innovative products as well, and I wanted to take a moment to highlight two of them. We are very pleased with the success of our U.S. launch of Prevnar 20 for adults. Second quarter U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family of vaccines for adults were up 337% operationally, compared with the prior-year quarter to $431 million, with Prevnar 20 representing more than three quarters of the total adult revenue. The great majority of U.S. healthcare networks, IDNs and retailers, who have made formulary decisions, have chosen Prevnar 20 alone as their higher valency pneumococcal vaccine of choice to help protect adults. This has resulted in Prevnar 20 having a 97% market share. This is also the first time there has been a routine recommendation for Prevnar for people in the 19 to 64 age group with underlying medical conditions. This group has an increased risk for contracting pneumococcal pneumonia and, unfortunately, has historically been the hardest to activate. Lastly, we believe the simplicity of Prevnar 20 being the only vaccine that can help protect patients with one dose in one visit is preferable to competitors' offerings. Quarterly revenues for Ibrance grew 1% in the U.S. compared with the same quarter last year, despite a continued increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through Assistance Program. This marked the first quarterly revenue uptick in the U.S. since the fourth quarter of 2020, which is an encouraging sign. Total volume in the U.S. increased 3% compared with the year ago quarter. Before I turn it over to Mikael, I want to touch on some actions we have taken recently to further demonstrate our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance, ESG principles. We recently announced an Accord for a Healthier World. Under this Accord, we are offering all of our patented, high-quality products that are available in the U.S. or the EU on a not-for-profit basis for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower income countries. This includes all future Pfizer products, as well. I am thrilled to say that the first product under this Accord has arrived in Rwanda, with more on the way. Pfizer's experts also held a session for 100 Rwandan medical professionals to discuss efficacy, safety and dosing of this milestone. This is just the first step of Accord implementation, but an important one that will impact many lives. We also recently announced our commitment to achieve the Net-Zero Standard across our value chain by year 2040. This is ten years ahead of a new voluntary external standard. This includes aiming to reduce our company emissions by 95% and value chain emissions by 90% within the next roughly 18 years. In response to the war in Ukraine, we are donating the equivalent of all profits from our sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Our first down payment of $5 million is going to eight global and local NGOs to support humanitarian relief and response efforts, and we will continue to channel these profits to the Ukrainian people until peace is achieved. I am also very proud to share with you that in a recently published report from MSCI, Pfizer's annual ESG rating increased three notches compared with June 2021, going from B to A. This is just the latest external recognition we have received for our commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices. I couldn't be prouder of our colleagues' commitment to good governance practices, quality and integrity. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Dave will provide financial details on the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Sure. William why don't you speak a little bit about the program, what we haven't rebounding? And then Angela, you speak a little bit about the trend of the revenues in the uptake. Thank you, William. And I need to say that we are very serious about PAXLOVID and we are looking very diligently. All the anecdotal reports that are coming, but all the data, I repeat all the data, our internal data, but we are detecting rebounds by proactively checking viral loads or the external data that have been reported through pharmacovigilance to us, or through studies that have been performed by third parties, very reputable third parties like Kaiser Permanente and or Mayo Clinic. They are consistent that this is low single-digit, actually less than 1% in the external studies. And it was as repeated around 2% in the methodology we used in ours and very consistent with the numbers of the placebo. So although we try to see if there is a need to do something about it, seriously, we can't find any data set other than anecdotal reports. Also, I want to emphasize that even the anecdotal reports, they are all indicating that it is a mild. So we don't have any rebound that it is more serious, right? And clearly, we haven't identified any single case that we have resistance to the PAXLOVID. So we are looking into it. And William said that we are going to run also some studies we're discussing our protocols with FDA to see if treatment of those cases could help. But so far our conclusion, although we are looking a lot, it is very small percentage similar to COVID placebo or COVID other antivirals, and with very mild symptoms. Angela, what about the trends internationally and in the U.S., if you want. Thank you. Thank you very much Terence. Mikael, why don't you take this question? And also Mikael, you spoke about A, you didn't speak about the B strains in the immunogenicity as they were similar to the current high dose of quadrivalent. [Ph] And then they think how confident we feel it is that although the regulatory pathway, it is just demonstrate non-inferiority in immunogenicity, we are going for an efficacy trial. So the trial that is we announced yesterday is going to measure real efficacy in flu, which we believe that we expect of course science is unpredictable, but we expect to win with flying colors. Let's go to the next one. Yes. Angela, what do you think if we go to open commercial market? Do you think that we will be better or worse off for PAXLOVID? Thank you, Angela. Well said. What about TL1A Mikael? Let's go to the next call. Mikael, maybe also could take that question. And also to add that this is for us clearly high priority project. We have a designation within the company what we call the Lightspeed project, project of significant value to patients and as a result also significant economic value where we give this designation and we move them with a speed of light and we overinvest to make sure that we derisk and we move fast. And I review personally on a biweekly \u2013 on the bimonthly basis, the progress of this program. So that is going to be one of them. Thank you very much. Next question, please. Thank you. I'm disappointed with what I'm reading in the newspapers. Of course, we can't know exactly what will happen because we have seen that this situation is very volatile, but everything that they are reporting they are going to implement a pride setting in reality it is not a price negotiation because they're forcing their will by implementing a 95% tax, according to previous guidance that will cause the industry significant. We estimate that 270 billion over 10 years. There is a positive provision there, but they're reducing the out of pocket cost for the patients. That's a significant one, but it's too little and too late. They could do way more because that will cost them 10% of the 270 billions, but they're going to collect. They are basically not doing that to alienate patient's costs because they could give all the money and then made significant, significant difference with the patient. They're just giving a part of that and they won't even to start it for understood well from year 2025. So although that out of pocket is a very positive provision, but the rest one is a provision that I think will force the industry to reduce R&D if it goes the way that they are suggesting. So other than that, I don't have anything to add. We will wait to see how the \u2013 what exactly in reality that means and we'll go from there. And also I want to say it is very disappointing that they're choosing to single out one industry everything in this bill, from what I understand [indiscernible] is affecting everyone, but then there are specific measures to affect only the pharma industry, particularly when we are out of the pandemic or this industry has proven the value that brings to public health and to the global economy. We would be in a very different point in this global economy if we didn't have the investments and the thriving life sciences sector. And they are choosing to single out this industry I think is wrong and I hope that the reason will prevail when this discussions goes to Congress. Let's move to the next question please. Yes. Why don't we go to William? Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you, David. Angela, what do you think? Thank you. Thank you, Angela. Thank you, David. Let's go to the next question, please. Thank you. Mikael, both questions goes to you. I think the first question thing was for RSV, right? Yes. Exactly. And also, I'm sorry if we gave the impression that RSV is not important to us. It's extremely important. There is no better good news. This is why we didn't mention it much, but still remains the very good news. But the previous studies were extremely strong and that the current studies are progressing very well. So we have very high confidence, absent a surprise, but we will launch next year, very robust product, both in adults and in maternal \u2013 the maternal whereas both studies are progressing very well. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question. Let's go to Angela for the number of countries and where we are with that. Thank you, Angela. And also to \u2013 because you had also question on supplier above, we have done tremendous, tremendous progress on that field. Actually, we have been able to reduce dramatically the lead time, so how much time it's needed for manufacturing and to have improved dramatically our yields. So supply is not an issue, actually removed almost everything in-house now in terms of API and finished product. Thank you very much. Next, go to the next question. So thank you very much. Chris, we do not provide, let's say, forward-looking projections on pricing and particularly every time I speak about pricing is becoming big news. So I want to make sure that we respect that. I know what you are asking and I can give a very high level answer. Clearly, we are providing special pricing when we are contracting very, very big quantities with governments. That's also the incentive for the government to buy big quantities because the price is really, really very attractive. If we move to normal market, the prices would reflect both in vaccines and in antivirals, the prices of similar value, similar technology products that they are out there. Clearly, also when you move to private to commercial markets, the complexities are getting way, way higher. We will need to go to single doses in the vaccines, so manufacturing complexities are very higher. We need to have distribution to small distribution centers, including physician offices. So all of that creates a very big complexity, but also could be taken into consideration as we price our products at that time. And I want to emphasize that also those present significant opportunities for us because the open market it is way more complex, way more diverse to have millions of customers rather than one or two and displays our strengths in terms of having global presence or within the U.S. a dramatic presence in every single territory of the country with thousands of people that they are calling physicians, hospitals, accounts \u2013 in payers accounts, et cetera, et cetera. So it's something that if we see a turn into this market also we would see us being able to compete more of a position of strength than now. As we get to Ibrance, Angela? Thank Angela. Next question, please. Thank you very much, Aamir is here. And he will be happy to speak about it. Aamir? Thank you. And it's very important when we are aiming very high to also be able at the same time to be disciplined. Disciplined in valuing the science and paying the right price for the right science, so that the capital that we will dispose will be maximized in producing value for patients and holders. So we grow very big $25 billion, but as we are proving, we are very, very disciplined in how we are allocating our capital. And we will continue doing that. With that, let's go to the next question. Thank you, Aamir. Thank you, Andrew. Just to make a correction. It was not the Head of our Vaccines that joined was another member of the vaccines team, but by no means was correct. Let's move to Mikael. And what about Ibrance? Anything to add William? Thank you from your lips to gut ears. Also, I want to add on the RSV, because it's the second question that came and maybe gave the impression that we are not very hot on it. We are extremely hot on it. Clearly very important product for us, clearly very important product for GSK. So there will be a lot of speculation. Maybe the other one will do that, or maybe the other thing will do this. I think data will speak on the cells with the totality of data available so far that I have seen. We have higher reasons to believe we are better, but you never know before the end of the trials. But right now with all-in-all looks like we have very, very strong profile with all the data that has seen so far. We are waiting a lot with a lot of excitement to underlying data and see the realities. And then of course the best will win. Next move now to Steve. I think we have answered it before, and maybe Mikael also can give some color because it's a very, very good question. But bottom line is we are looking for science that it could provide hope that we can have something better than Eliquis and we haven't found yet. So that's the reality. According to our opinion, there is not much maturity right now to overcome the brilliant, the very good profile of Eliquis. Mikael anything to add that simple as that? Yep. Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Angela? Yeah. What was the second question? I'm not sure. It was the \u2013 you want to speak, I did refer to it, but maybe also you can yeah reiterate it David. Is what I said before. We are moving most of it now, because we could way faster than what we anticipated, move it inside. So that created some cancellation of raw materials to some external suppliers. I'm sorry about that. I think that was the last question. Let me close with a few takeaways. The first one, as you see, we continue to deliver strong operational performance. We increased our full year 2022 operational financial forecast, while maintaining it challenging for an extension environment. So I think few companies likely will be able to do that. We believe we are well positioned not only to maintain, but also to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. It will be for us very important focus. And we believe that the medical need will be there for the years to come. That's why we're investing so heavily. We continue focus on driving long-term shareholder returns by remaining very disciplined both on our operations and our incremental capital deployment, you saw even in this quarter but even more we are squeezing our administrative expenses our SMA is going down. And then we reinvest in R&D because we have programs that we are starting, that we feel is a very good return on our investment. And we continue to advance our internal scientific pipeline while executing against our previously announced plans to potentially add at least $25 billion of risk adjusted revenues through business development opportunities from 2030 comply. Just I want very quickly to see that these results in our yielding curve, this efforts in our year-end results. Just to mention few of the potential approvals and launches that we're going to have in the next few months. CIBINQO, we expect to launch the adolescence in next year. And of course next year will be very first year where we expect to have full access for this drug. We expect to launch next year, RSV maternal. We expect to launch next year RMV adults. We expect to launch next year, Prevnar 20 for pediatrics. We expect to launch next year, Elranatamab for triple class refractory myeloma. We expect to launch next year, Ritlecitinib for atopic. We expect to launch next year TRUMENBA, our meningococcal vaccine. We expect to launch next year Talapro for prostate cancer metastatic castrations with patients. We expect to launch Myfembree for endometriosis. And then a little bit later, we expect maybe this in 2023 or beginning of 2024 DMD and through mRNA. So this is the organic, I'm not referring to the Biohaven that is coming and to other molecules I'm referring mainly to the organically developed pipeline assets.

So with that in mind, I'm really looking forward to have a 6% CAGR by 2025 in our business as we promised in 2019. In fact, year-to-date, we are at 6% excluding BD and excluding COVID. And I think we will do that by 2025, we will maintain this 6% CAGR and we will do more by BD that with are right now implementing. So I think we have a very good growth prospect, and we will maintain our leadership in comp. Thank you very, very much for your interest. And for those that have summer vacations yet, enjoy your summer vacations."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Albert, and thanks for the question. So as we reported earlier in the EPIC-HR study, we did see a single agent percent of potential rebound. But we also saw it in the placebo arm with a very similar rate. Since then we have seen other studies coming out including from the Mayo Clinic, Case Western, and Kaiser Permanente and others showing data that's very consistent with ours in terms of single-digit percent of rebound. And it's also been seen not only with placebo, but also with competitor antivirals. And internally, we also have data from real-world data, as well as additional pharmacovigilance data showing again that it's a very similar low percentage rate of recurrence. That said, though we are working with the FDA to finalize plans for a trial in which we would treat such patients and we're still deciding on the final outline of that. And in addition as Mikael outlined, we'll be looking at other cohorts of patients, for example, immunocompromised patients who have a large unmet medical need. And in that setting, we will be looking at, for example, five days, 10 days and 15 days of dosing to determine the optimum dose regimen for those patients. Yes, sure. So thanks for the question, Louise. So we saw the news the other day. Internally, we remain confident in our program with Trillium and we proceed with the programs that we are planning and we'll let the data speak for itself when they come out. Yeah, I would just add as you mentioned Mikael, the preclinical data shows that the protein degradation could be superior to selective estrogen receptor integrators. And so we're very excited about this potential to be superior to search that are being developed."

            "content": "Thank you, Albert. I'd like to start by highlighting two recent leadership appointments. I've appointed Annaliesa Anderson to lead Vaccine Research & Development, succeeding Kathrin Jansen, who previously announced her retirement. With more than two decades of biopharma R&D experience, Liesa most recently served as CSO for Bacterial Research and Hospital. Over the last two years, she has led the team of infectious disease biologists that designed and delivered PAXLOVID to an emergency use authorization. Under her leadership, we also advanced several bacterial vaccine programs into clinical development and approval. I've also named Charlotte Allerton, CSO for Anti-Infectives, a new research unit. Creating this new research unit allows us to expand our focus beyond medicines that typically are used in hospitals. Charlotte is an esteemed scientist who will broaden our anti-viral strategies with additional efforts in antibacterial and anti-fungal science and medicines. Charlotte has been our Head of Medicine Design most notably co-leading the discovery and development of PAXLOVID and will continue in that role, as well. I have had the privilege to work closely with Liesa and Charlotte for more than 10 years and have been continuously impressed by them as world class scientists in their respective fields of expertise. Both have demonstrated good product hunting skills and a sound business mindset. I'm looking forward to working with them in their new roles. Let's begin with COVID-19. The pandemic continues to evolve into a disease which is causing significant disease burden, including high rates of acute disease, medical care utilization, hospitalization and deaths, during the entire year. A growing number of patients affected by acute COVID infections are developing chronic disease and suffering from long COVID symptoms affecting multiple organs such as the lungs, heart, kidney and brain and the vascular system. We have seen major waves of variants of concern emerge quickly, become dominant, then be superseded by the next variant. Omicron and its sublineages are the most antigenically distinct compared to prior variants of concern, more transmissible and show evidence of partial immune escape from existing vaccines. As the composition of SARs-CoV-2 changes, it is essential we advance new approaches to extend the level of protection that COMIRNATY originally conveyed. In a clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of mono and bivalent Omicron BA.1-modified vaccines administered as a fourth dose in more than 1,900 participants over age 55. We are also evaluating different doses of mono and bivalent BA.1 in participants 18 to 55 years of age. While we saw promising responses to both mono and bivalent versions in the over 55 population, we moved forward with bivalent following guidance from regulators. The BA.1 vaccine candidate elicited a superior immune response for BA.1 compared to the current version of the vaccine. A seroresponse rate which exceeded noninferiority and neutralization activity which increased substantially. The BA.1 vaccine neutralized wild type and Delta similarly to the current version of the vaccine, suggesting the Omicron-modified version maintained responses for the ancestral strain and other variants. Based on these data and following guidance from regulators, we have completed regulatory submissions in Europe, UK and Canada for the 30-microgram bivalent vaccine in individuals 12 and older and plan submissions in other markets soon. The data also showed this vaccine candidate neutralized Omicron BA.4 and BA.5, though to a lesser extent than BA.1. This suggested a need to develop both a BA.1-modified vaccine and a BA.4/5-modified vaccine. We studied BA.4/5 monovalent and bivalent booster candidates in mice and found a substantial increase in neutralization responses to all Omicron variants of concern. Neutralizing titers against BA.4/5 increased 11-fold for the monovalent and 4.8-fold for the bivalent compared to monovalent BA.1 vaccine. These data were shared at the recent FDA advisory committee meeting as a potential surrogate to help expedite development of a BA.4/5 vaccine. We plan to submit the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine candidate for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. in preparation for the fall booster campaign. To adapt more rapidly, we have agreed with FDA that this submission will be based on safety and immunogenicity data generated in adults with an Omicron-modified BA.1 vaccine and supported by BA.4/5 bivalent-specific preclinical data and BA.4/5 bivalent chemistry, manufacturing and controls data. This strategy is bolstered by previous experience showing that overall responses have been similar between human clinical and mouse data, our clinical experience with Beta and Omicron-modified vaccine candidates, and by leveraging our mRNA platform and manufacturing experience for the current vaccine. To support future potential U.S. licensure and global registrations, we plan to initiate a clinical study to evaluate the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine. The clinical study design is under discussion with the FDA. We aspire to continue leading with science and working to identify vaccines that will help provide strong and durable protection as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. We aim to deliver a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that can provide durable antibody and T cell immune protection against severe disease and hospitalization for at least one year. We plan to take a stepwise approach by designing and testing different candidates that engage multiple arms of the immune system including antibodies and T cells. First, yesterday we announced the start of a Phase 2 study evaluating a bivalent modRNA vaccine candidate which consists of RNAs encoding novel enhanced prefusion spike proteins for the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and an Omicron variant. The enhanced spike protein encoded from the mRNAs has been modified with the aim of increasing the magnitude and breadth of antibody neutralization response that could better protect against COVID-19. We project delivering key clinical data this fall. Second, we plan to initiate a proof-of-concept study with a potential pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by the end of the year. This combines the super-stabilized spike sequences with a T-cell enhancing construct, aiming to extend durability of protection against severe disease and new emerging SARs-CoV-2 viral variants. Now turning to PAXLOVID, last month, we submitted a new drug application to the U.S. FDA, seeking approval for the treatment of COVID-19 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated adults and pediatric patients 12 years and over weighing at least 40 kilograms at high risk for progression to severe illness. We anticipate a PDUFA date in the first quarter of 2023. We plan to generate further data in those who are immunocompromised, hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and at increased risk for poor outcomes due to the disease or who are pregnant. We also are considering multiple collaborative studies to evaluate potential treatment for long COVID. Finally, we are working with the FDA to finalize a protocol to study patients who may be in need of retreatment. According to CDC, a brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARSCoV-2 infection in some people. We believe the occurrence of COVID-19 rebound is uncommon and not uniquely associated with any specific treatment. At this time, cases are being reported at a rate consistent with the EPIC-HR trial. Turning now to flu, we know that currently available vaccines are not optimal in addressing the unmet need as each year many people are infected, hospitalized and die, resulting in tremendous public health and economic impact. In part, this is because the flu vaccine development cycle is inefficient and even when current seasonal vaccine strains match circulating strains well, they typically confer only 40% to 60% protection. Potential advantages of the mRNA platform include shortened timelines to enable a quicker response each season, improved strain matching, faster and more reliable manufacturing and broader immune responses from both antibodies and T cells, the latter needed particularly in older adults. Based on our experience with COVID-19, T cell responses appear to be critical for protection against severe disease and hospitalization in infectious viral disease. Here we show Phase 2 T cell data for our quadrivalent mod-mRNA flu vaccine candidate in subjects 65 and older. We believe this is the first evidence of a flu vaccine candidate inducing substantial responses for both CD4 and CD8 T cells. On the left, at day seven the CD4 T cell response was more than two-fold for all four flu strains for our vaccine compared to a current high dose vaccine now recommended in the U.S. for adults 65 and older. Over half of the cohort receiving our vaccine candidate had a more than two-fold response. On the right, at day seven the CD8 T cell response and responder rates were greater for all four strains for our vaccine candidate versus the comparator. Our belief is that these encouraging T cell responses, combined with higher seroconversion rates through A strains which are the most predominant circulating strains and have pandemic potential may translate into improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. Based on these data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 efficacy study this year. We're excited to share that new data on our oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, two abstracts on twice-daily danuglipron and one on our once-daily candidate known as 1532 have been accepted for the European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference in September. These investigational medicines were designed in-house by Pfizer's innovative chemistry and discovery teams. In a Phase 1 study in adults with Type 2 diabetes, after only six weeks of treatment, 1532 robustly reduced mean daily glucose to almost near-normal levels. Participants also experienced weight loss of up to 5 kilograms, compared with 2 kilograms for placebo. We believe this to be a potentially best-in-class profile across both injectables and orals. Similar changes in body weight were observed in participants with non-diabetic obesity, 1532 is characterized by favorable once-daily pharmacokinetics, a low risk for drug-drug interactions, robust efficacy across multiple metabolic endpoints and GLP-1 receptor agonist class-like tolerability which overall encouraged us to plan for a Phase 2 study to pick the winning candidate prior to a potential Phase 3 study start. These development programs may lead to potential indications in Type 2 diabetes, obesity, NASH and cardiovascular risk reduction in Type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. Over the 12 past months, we have built a strong inflammation and immunology portfolio with diverse products to help address multiple drivers of disease and unmet need. CIBINQO was approved for atopic dermatitis in adults and last week received priority review designation in the U.S. for adolescents 12 to 18 years. We are nearing a regulatory submission for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis. We have submitted regulatory applications in the U.S., Europe and UK for ritlecitinib for alopecia areata and are awaiting acceptances. We also plan to start a Phase 3 study of ritlecitinib in vitiligo this year. We are pleased to now share promising new updated data from our anti-Interferon beta monoclonal antibody in specialized rheumatology. Patients with dermatomyositis show elevated Type I Interferon gene signature in blood, skin and muscle, correlating with disease activity in skin. As we continue our development of this candidate, a potential breakthrough therapy for hard-to-treat dermatomyositis which attacks the skin and muscles, we believe it may have the ability to address a broader set of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, possibly including polymyositis and lupus. On our third quarter 2021 call, I shared data from our ongoing Phase 2 dermatomyositis study, focused on skin inflammation and showing significant reduction in disease activity when compared with placebo in just three months of treatment. Now both doses met the primary efficacy endpoint in skin predominant disease. The disease also manifests with progressively debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue. Early data suggest that in a small cohort of patients with muscle predominant disease, our candidate resulted in numerically better efficacy scores across all key muscle endpoints including patient-reported outcomes after three weeks. We plan to submit the data for presentation once the study completes. Now, a promising update on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen CD3-targeted bispecific antibody. At ASCO, we presented data from a Phase 1 trial in people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma whose disease is refractory to at least one agent in each of three major classes of medications approved for the disease. We saw a confirmed overall response rate of 64% and 35% of patients achieved stringent complete response or complete response. More than half who received prior BCMA-directed therapy, such as an antibody-drug conjugate or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, achieved a response. Responders' probability of being event free at nine months was 77%. Elranatamab elicited durable Minimal Residual Disease or MRD negativity meaning no disease was detected after treatment in all evaluable patients who experienced a complete response or stringent complete response. Molecular responses were durable as well with 60% \u2013 62% of those complete responders documented to have MRD negativity at more than six months, including two patients who were MRD negative beyond 18 months. MagnetisMM-1 results, and emerging data from MagnetisMM-3 which is studying triple-class refractory multiple myeloma support further development across a broader program with potential registration enabling studies MagnetisMM-5 in patients with double-class exposed multiple myeloma and MagnetisMM7 in newly diagnosed post-transplant patients with multiple myeloma. There is potential for deep and durable results that can be broadly accessible to patients due to off-the-shelf, subcutaneous, and convenient dosing. The efficacy and safety profile we have seen to date in a challenging patient population supports advancement into earlier lines of treatment. Finally, here is a snapshot of select milestones for this year, showing healthy progress in the pipeline. It was an important quarter for COVID execution, and we look forward to sharing complete readouts from anti-Interferon Beta and the modFlu candidate before the end of the year. Thank you for your attention. Let me turn it over to Dave. Yes. We will share details in upcoming conference, but I can just give a little bit more color. As you know, the highest medical burden and hospitalization of cures in the 65 plus were the A strains are the most dominant. We had very strong titers against the A strains and exceeding what you would see with the current recommended vaccines. So we are very bullish about our ability with mRNA to induce both strong antibody response and CD4 and CD8 T cells, which are not in used by current standard of care. And this is the reason why we are sharing today that we are announcing to Phase 3 study. Tolerability, sorry. Tolerability of this 30 microgram, sorry, Terence. I didn't note that first. Tolerability is of course supported by our billion of doses of the platform in COVID. And on top of that in older adults, the 30 microgram have a very good acceptance, the main patient group. And I believe it's going to be excellent and very similar to other available flu vaccines. Yes. I didn't mention the B strains. We noted in general, lower response to B strains with both standard of care. And we edged on the lower side with our vaccine. That's why I was so encouraged to see the unique T cell response against the B cell strain and the total of that data make us encouraged that we will have a strong product for both A and B. Briefly, this is our internally discovered antibody against TL1A, a member of the TNF superfamily that is associated with inflammatory diseases. Yes, we had consistent, robust efficacy for all come you see patients and very strong efficacy consistent across the trial for a prospectively defined precision biomarker. Tolerability was very good. Now this is induction data, and later this year, we will have maintenance data and as we get those data set, we will decide about next step. Yes. We are very excited about this new data set [indiscernible] that you will see at EASD Meeting in Stockholm in September, there will be additional data. And I think you will find HbA1c very encouraging, although this was a short study. I think, compared to oral semaglutide, the differentiation is substantial. This is a true small molecule that can be given. So once a day, it's completely independent on fasting or meal concordance. And I think you will be able to reach higher effects on both glucose as well as on weight reduction. As I reported now, we were almost at 100 mg/dL reduction over four to six week and five kilogram. And we haven't yet optimized the titration to even higher doses. So we are very encouraged of what we see we going to share with regulators soon, our next trial set and move swiftly to allow us to pick the winner and the regimen for a potential Phase 3 study to come after the Phase 2b. Yes. We have made a great progress in the RSV adult file. As you know, we ran it through two different seasons in the northern and southern hemisphere to make sure we had good patient experience and cases. Things are looking good for a readout that would come soon. I remain very positive about RSV adult based on our Phase 2 challenge data that was stellar and the role this particular entity and that we're targeting play unless we are the only one that are targeting the two forms of this perfusion. You also asked about modRNA flu. Yes, as Albert mentioned, we are going big here with an efficacy study. We are enquired about the data we're seeing. We think it's a unique dataset. And we plan to soon embark on our Phase 3 after proper dialogue with regulators. Of course, this is an event trial, but if the season is robust, which you can never know, we would expect the Phase 3 to readout next year. Yeah. I am very optimistic about our RSV vaccine construct. We have seen high immune titer that are critical for the vaccine across all ages. In fact, we are the only one that have showed cross strain A and B for RSV, the ReViral high titers, which differ between all the vaccines, including the one that you mentioned, because they mainly measure cross activity from A to B strain. So that was supported also by our challenge data that looked formidable. So while nobody can predict exactly outcome of studies and compare one study to another, we remain very bullish that our bivalent vaccine should stand out in performance and in tolerability. Please note some of the arguments, including the one that you referred to often associated with somewhat unpleasant side effects. And that was one part of our differentiation to achieve with the bivalent, very high data is far and with best in class tolerability. The ARV-471, I can only speak about the science here, that we see that drug being active in several lines as by itself best-in-class estrogen receptor PROTAC. And we are going to set up our studies in a patient population, which contains many estrogen receptor mutants, which often are poorly managed by the current available fulvestrant or other sides. And we think this is a unique opportunity. And number two, the drugs seem to combine very well with our own CDK4/6 drugs, and we think it could advance into early metastatic lines and possible over time, even to early breast cancer, maybe they're combined with our CDK4. So we have very high hopes for that class of drugs ARV-47 1 combined with our pipeline. Thank you. I think you said it very well, in the atrial fib platlet inhibitor and ASI are going to be genericized Eliquis and Rivaroxaban, great drugs, Eliquis being a market leader Factor X inhibitor or by the time Factor XI comes to market close to, or already generalized. So the room for an expensive drug in an area with this many great treatments that requires tremendously high R&D expense coming off the patients have consumed multiple great drugs. For us doesn't look like the best area to deploy capital. We always wish other would like for the benefit of patients."

            "name": "Dave Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mikael and good morning, everyone. As this is my first call as CFO, I thought I would set the stage for the next chapter of Pfizer, and our relentless focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Over the past few years, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities have expanded significantly, and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. It's clear to me the company is uniquely positioned for growth, and at the same time, enhancing financial returns. And as we look to the future of the company, we are focused on three primary areas to drive significant shareholder value. First and foremost is our continued emphasis and investment in science and innovation. We are investing internally and externally to create breakthrough medicines, deploying more than $50 billion in this area in the past three years alone. Our second priority is maintaining and growing Pfizer's dividend, paying out more than $25 billion to shareholders over this period. We recognize that our dividend represents an important component of returns for our investors. And finally, from time to time, we will return capital to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases. Over the past three years, the company has allocated nearly $9 billion in this area. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value will be a major focus and I believe all three areas will contribute to our success. More recently, in year to date, we deployed more than $12 billion into innovation, paid dividends of $4.5 billion, and repurchased $2 billion of our shares. This demonstrates an on-going commitment to our robust capital deployment framework. With that now let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I will confine my remarks largely to adjusted and operational growth figures. Turning to the income statement. Revenues increased 53% operationally in the second quarter of 2022. These results were driven by momentum in PAXLOVID sales and strong sales of the COVID-19 vaccine; and underlying strength from a number of our key products. Excluding PAXLOVID and Comirnaty, Biopharma product revenues grew operationally by 2% compared to the prior year. In-line products, Xeljanz and Chantix, were impacted by labelling changes and a global pause in shipments, respectively. While Ibrance continued to transition into a new COVID normal market environment. PC1, our contract manufacturing business, grew 89% operationally in the second quarter 2021, and therefore faced a tough comparison versus last year, with PC1 declining by 25% operationally. And now bringing that together, Pfizer's non-COVID-related revenues grew by 1% operationally in the second quarter. Adjusted cost of sales dollars grew more slowly than revenues, resulting in gross margin rate expansion of 570 basis points versus the second quarter of LY. This improvement in gross margin is largely attributable to the impact of higher-margin PAXLOVID sales; partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine sales; and the impact of a $450 million write-off of COVID-related inventory that had expired or are expected to expire. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we chose to manufacture and hold excess stock to ensure we could meet global health demand for products if an extreme need were to arise. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the second quarter grew by 7% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and Comirnaty, and higher healthcare reform fees. The 27% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q2 was primarily driven by investments in multiple late-stage clinical programs, including programs to prevent and treat COVID-19, and costs to develop recently-acquired programs. The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter of 15.4% declined by 170 basis points versus last year driven by a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. And as a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.73 grew by 77%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04 grew 92%; on operational basis adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 100% in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results; negatively impacting revenues and adjusted earnings per share by 7% or $0.08 per share. So with that, let's move to our 2022 guidance. Given our strong second quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year, we are increasing our operational revenue expectations by $2 billion, and operational adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.24. Unfortunately, given additional U.S. dollar strengthening since we last updated guidance in early May, foreign exchange negatively impacts revenues by $2 billion, leaving our reported revenue guidance range unchanged at $98 to $102 billion. This represents an operational growth rate of 29% at the midpoint compared to 2021, a 200 basis point improvement over prior expectations. The improvement in our operational adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook of $0.24 is also negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, compressing EPS by $0.19. The net impact of these cross currents allows the company to raise the low-end of its adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05 to $6.30 to $6.45 a share. This represents 65% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we continue to expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, unchanged compared to our prior guidance provided on May 3, despite the impact of approximately $1 billion of incremental negative foreign exchange. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance unchanged, despite an incremental $300 million headwind due to FX. Our non-COVID-related revenues are absorbing approximately $700 million of impact from negative foreign exchange. Given the seasonality that we expect, I would also like to give you some color on the expected cadence of these COVID-related revenues across the second half. Based on current guidance for Comirnaty, we expect approximately 25% of second half sales in Q3 and 75% of sales in Q4, driven by expected deliveries of Omicron-adapted vaccines in Q4, again subject to regulatory approval. Conversely for PAXLOVID, we expect approximately 60% of sales in Q3 and 40% in Q4.  So, with that, let me give you some detail on changes in our cost and expense guidance. We are decreasing our expected adjusted SI&A spend by $300 million across the range to $12.2 to $13.2 billion. Additionally, we are also increasing our guidance for adjusted R&D expense by $500 million at the low-end only, with the new range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, reflecting incremental investments in multiple programs, including mRNA vaccine programs outside of COVID-19 and other programs. We are also slightly reducing our expected effective tax rate on adjusted income by 50 basis points to approximately 15.5%. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases, beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March 2022. So in closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. This is Dave. Carter, this is Dave. Thank you for the question. Let me walk you the guidance for this year from a vaccine perspective. As you well know, we had a guidance of $32 billion to begin with as we entered \u2013 come out of Q1. There's really three moving parts as I think about our guidance for the year: one is we do have an incremental contract from the USG for 105 million doses this year, which is an uptick to that guidance; Secondly, we're experiencing headwinds from an FX perspective to the tune of $1 billion since Q1, but for the year, really $2 billion in that product alone; and then third, as I just articulated, the cadence of deliveries in the back half is really skewed to Q4. And with that, some ex-U.S. deliveries could move from November into December of the calendar year. And if that were to occur, given our one month lag from a reporting perspective that would fall \u2013 those revenues would fall into Q1 of 2023. I do not know whether that's going to happen, but I'm planning that it might happen. So therefore, I'm probably being conservative in my approach, in my outlook to the revenue guide for that specific medicine. Yeah. I think Albert indicated this earlier in his remarks, is that in fact over the last several quarters, we've improved our manufacturing process, reduced the cycle time and importantly improved the yield from an output perspective. So therefore we don't need as much raw materials and API to produce the same amount of finished goods. And then finally we've actually invested in our network to make sure that we can actually produce some API as well. So we're in good shape."

            "content": "Chris, thank you for the question. Let me just start with your specific FTC point. I think we've demonstrated a very strong track record of shepherding our transactions to-date through the regulatory process. And that's been largely built on having just a close successful, constructive, and collaborative relationships with regulatory bodies globally. In addition, our business development focus and I'll recap, our priorities in a second, is focus on how do we use our unique abilities to translate emerging science into breakthrough medicine. So most of the deals that we do are pro-patient and they're pro-innovation. So we're confident that we can continue to advance our BD strategies in a successful way. We've been very clear that our goal is to add $25 billion of risk adjusted revenue by 2030. And I think we are making very good progress against that. This year you saw our transaction with ReViral and subsequently with Biohaven, which respectively we believe have the potential to add $1.5 billion and $6 billion in peak sales to our business. And this was on the back of a very active 2021. And going forward, we're leaving very few stones unturned when we look at opportunities and our focus is going to be consistent. It's on scientific substrate that has the potential breakthrough for patients, deals that accelerate our top line growth in the back half of the decade, and then opportunities where we can add substantial value, whether that's through our scientific chops and/or our commercial capabilities. And we're going to be very open to deal structures. And we've said before, we're also going to be agnostic to size. We've been clear about the fact that cost synergy driven deals are not where our focus is going to be, and we're going to be extremely disciplined. I think we're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us and the flexibility that our balance sheet gives us to pursue those. And on your question on valuation fluctuations, those market valuation fluctuations are not going to drive RBD strategy. We're going to remain focused on fundamentals in the way that I described."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "So globally, I think that we're doing really well and we're making excellent progress. We have made and manufactured 30 million doses, and we delivered 23.5 million of those doses. So I think that the contracting is going well. The demand and expectations for the need for PAXLOVID is definitely up there. But maybe let me use some U.S. examples where things are - where we have a little bit more data and where things I think are going particularly well. The U.S. actually contracted a 10.8 million doses with us so far and 7.4 million doses of all of those have already been allocated to all the states. So I think that gives you a sense of how much demand is coming in from all of the states, and then every single week, our utilization of PAXLOVID has also increased. In fact, most recently we hit an all-time high of 389,000 doses or doses of PAXLOVID that were used in just in one week. So that gives you a sense of sort of the increase and the momentum. What's really driving this is, obviously, the education and the familiarity and the experience now of physicians, as well as patients. But also the excellent work that is being done at the federal, as well as the state level \u2013 at the state level in terms of education and utilization. And I want to call out in particular, the test-to-treat program that I think has been particularly effective and very positive. To date, more than 41,000 pharmacies are now test-to-treat centers. And that means that that just gives access to a tremendous amount of the population to be able to access PAXLOVID. And also recently pharmacists are now able to prescribe PAXLOVID within certain limitations. And over and above whatever states and the federal government are doing Pfizer is also aggressively and assertively supporting education. So actually, we have leveraged the entire Pfizer field force to provide education, we're running webinars. And to date, we've reached over 300,000 healthcare professionals, as well as 80,000 pharmacists just to give you a sense of the extent and the breadth of reach that we have accomplished. And all of that and also complemented by public service announcements about driving awareness of the treatment, but also the individual risk that each patient could carry and making them aware that they could be a potential candidates for PAXLOVID. So I think with all of these efforts that have gone on and that we're continuing, we feel really good about the momentum of PAXLOVID, the utilization of PAXLOVID, and the benefit that PAXLOVID can bring, particularly in a time when there's surges going on around the entire world. Yes. So I think that there are elements that we will be able to implement in the commercial market that currently that we don't. So for sure, you've just heard me share comments about the efforts that we've put into PAXLOVID already here in the U.S. and ex-U.S., right? The execution and the support of education support of our entire field forces, support of retail, support of patients through education again, and PSAs. Now, all that will continue, but I think what happens in a full commercial launch is that you will have multiple distributors and multiple points of distribution throughout the entire country. You will have stocking by every pharmacist, pharmacy, and pharmacist and various points of use. And so I think that in a commercial setting actually, you'll be able to reach a much broader set of channels that we currently even do today. So I think that's one difference. I think, the second difference is that what you can do from a commercial perspective will also look different. Remember today we're under an EUA and while we can do a lot of education, key things like sampling cannot be done in an EUA. So that's going to be an example of another difference that will happen post EUA. And then I think finally even if you think about consumer education, today we've really limited ourselves to unbranded and sort of disease awareness education, but again in a commercial setting, you could support through branded education and talk a lot more about the product. And so all of these are things that actually Pfizer does and the commercial organization of Pfizer does really well. This is our sweet spot. So I think that we look forward to building on top of what the government has been doing, which has been really excellent and building on top of that to do more and to support greater initiatives across the country. Well, we continue to be really pleased with how VYNDAQEL is doing. If you look at just from a diagnosis perspective, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, we continue to do a really great job of effectively finding and identifying who that ATTR-CM patients are diagnosing them and then bringing them on to therapies. So in this quarter we have reached an all time high over 40% diagnosis rate. And I think that this is well beyond what we thought we would be able to do in the timeframe that we have had. So we continue to believe in the growth that this product has. The real world data that has been generated now and the overall survival benefits are really compelling. And the fact that we are the only product being able to demonstrate these benefits, I think speaks well to how we'll continue to be able to build in this market despite competition that will arise. I think what you're referring to in terms of the impact and the expectations really is a one-time effect in and it was in Japan. And this was a very specific price decrease that was planned and driven by regulation. When VYNDAQEL was launched in Japan, again based on pricing regulation in the country, that was specific to the country, it was much higher price than any other country we had. And so by regulation, again, it's the 75% price decrease that we're seeing is a function of that. But the underlying growth of VYNDAQEL in Japan is really strong. We had just in the first half of 2022, 69% volume growth. We had 32% year-over-year of new patient starts. So, hopefully, this gives you a sense that the net revenue impacts you see are, in fact, not a reflection of the demand and the true underlying demand, whether it's in the U.S. or ex-U.S. Yes. So we are in contract with a significant number of countries at this point, maybe I can talk about it from a dose perspective. So more than 35 million treatment courses have already been contracted with a number of countries and this is what we publicly disclosed. There are additional doses that I can't talk about because either the country didn't want us to disclose them publicly or we're in the middle of negotiations with them. So I think to answer your question since we last left off, we have made progress with our contracting. I think what's \u2013 maybe what's more important to clarify is just that the approach that countries are taking to contract with us is just really different to where we were in Comirnaty. In Comirnaty, they were interested in securing large amounts of doses upfront, but that's in fact not the case here in PAXLOVID. And the reason being that number one, they're being prudent with how they are ordering. And they're able to do that because they know that we have the manufacturing capacity and that we can pivot as we need. They will \u2013 the countries are also trying to manage inventory and not to have too much aged product lying around. And so I think that this is what's driving the more smaller more frequent contracting rather than big, big contracts that like you saw in Comirnaty. The other thing I will also say is, and the reason why I'm talking in doses rather than specific countries is because we're also working with supranational organizations, who are acting on behalf of multiple countries. So think Global Fund, think UNICEF, these are \u2013 in addition to the bilaterals there are also important organizations who are helping us to supply and bring doses into the countries. So I think all in all great progress, and I think you should expect to see that this is one of these things will \u2013 that will just keep inching away because of how countries want to manage the inventory and the supply. Sure. Well, as you say, the metastatic breast cancer CDK4/6 market is incredibly competitive yet. I will emphasize that Ibrance continues to be the leading CDK4/6 inhibitor. In fact, we have a 74% market share across all patients in first line therapy. So I \u2013 and I think that this number has been pretty consistent because we talk about it every quarter. And I think it demonstrates just the tremendous experience that physicians and patients have and the confidence they have in Ibrance despite new competition, the patient experience, the fact that we have real-world clinical evidence. All of this really adds to the confidence that we have in this brand. And even though Ibrance is a mature brand, we do continue to see growth and where the growth will come from \u2013 from the following places. You're going to see growth from the CDK class. You're going to see growth from the recovery of new patient starts, which as you know has not recovered to the levels of the \u2013 of prior to the pandemic, as well as stabilization of the PAP through time when economic conditions improve. And I actually want to make a special point of this class growth because therein lies, I think, a tremendous opportunity for all of us. Today, well, last year, this time, the CDK class was 48% in first line metastatic breast cancer use. This quarter, it was 54%. So even though it's grown, that still means that the majority of the time CDKs are not being used. And I think all of us in this class really need to focus on this as the leading priority in helping to grow each of our brands, but also to grow the class to impact patient outcome. Sure. I think that the way we are manufacturing PAXLOVID with of course, great knowledge from our prior experiences with COMIRNATY, but also in terms of our negotiations and discussions with countries is actually allowing us to do supply planning very well. So we are manufacturing as we need and according to the contracts and according to the demand that the countries are providing us. So I think we're doing that in a very prudent and in a very \u2013 in a prudent and an effective way. So I didn't \u2013 we didn't your second question?"

A brief question-and-answer session will follow prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steven Immergut. Please go ahead.\nSteven Immergut: Thank you, and welcome to GBT's conference call to discuss the company's financial results for the first quarter 2022 and to provide a business update. I'm Steven Immergut, Head of Communications and Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Dr. Ted Love, our President and CEO; Jeff Farrow, Chief Financial Officer; David Johnson or DJ, Chief Commercial Officer; and Dr. Kim Smith Whitley, Executive Vice President and Head of R&D. During today's call, Ted will give an update on our progress in Q1, Jeff will review our financial results, DJ will give an update on the Oxbryta launch, Ken will discuss our pipeline and then Ted will give a few closing remarks before we open the line for questions. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release announcing GBT's financial results and business progress for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.

I'll now turn the call over to Ted.\nTed Love: Thank you, Steven, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a notable start to the year for GBT, highlighted by strong sequential growth in new prescriptions of Oxbryta, including a promising start to our launch in patient ages 4 to 11. The early feedback and metrics on the pediatric launch have been encouraging. For example, we've already secured coverage with many important payers for this expanded indication. In patient ages 12 and older, we had our best result for new prescriptions in several quarters. We are optimistic that this momentum will continue if our key growth drivers increased overall awareness and interest in Oxbryta as we expect. In addition, we are hopeful that the COVID-19 environment will continue to improve given the significant headwinds it has caused for delivery of regular in-person care for patients with SCD. With respect to Europe, we continue to make exciting progress. Following the marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the European Commission in February, we completed regulatory activities to put us on track for a potential approval in Great Britain by mid-year. We kicked off reimbursement discussions in Germany, France and England and continue to enroll patients in our early access program. We also began educating HCPs on Oxbryta and have robust activities planned for launch in Germany very soon and for the EHA meeting in June. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to aggressively advance our clinical programs while exploring additional therapeutic targets in SCD and other red blood cell disorders. For GBT601, we plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial by mid-2022. And later in the call, Kim will provide an exciting update on the restart of our Phase 1 study based on patient interest. Altogether, we are well positioned to continue delivering for patients with SCD. We have continued to build momentum with Oxbryta both in the U.S. and internationally, and we are advancing what we believe is the most comprehensive pipeline in sickle cell disease. Our dedication to supporting the SCD community has never been stronger, and our progress with these and other efforts are highlighted in our recently published 2021 ESG report. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to review the first quarter 2022 results.\nJeff Farrow: Thank you, Ted. Total net revenue from sales of Oxbryta was $55.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, in line with our guidance of $54 million to $56 million; first quarter revenue increased by approximately $16 million or 41% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, first quarter revenue declined slightly from the fourth quarter. This reflects the anticipated work down of inventory during the quarter following increased purchases by distributors at the end of the fourth quarter, an incremental increase in gross to net and the impact of Omicron variant in the first part of the quarter. These drivers were partially offset by the continued increase in the net number of patients on Oxbryta, days of inventory on hand at the end of the first quarter was in line with historical levels. Gross to net was 16.3% for the quarter, around 0.5% increase from the fourth quarter, primarily related to increased patient co-pay support as commercial insurance out-of-pocket deductibles reset for patients for the new year as well as higher 340B and Medicaid accruals in the quarter. Now turning to expenses. Cost of sales for the quarter was $1 million compared with $600,000 for the first quarter of 2021, which represents a slight increase on a percentage of sales basis. Cost of sales is anticipated to increase in 2022 as we begin to finish utilizing the remainder of our fully expensed inventory that was previously recorded as R&D expense. R&D expense for the first quarter was $53 million compared with $51 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to an increase in external costs related to GBT601, partially offset by a decrease in external costs related to Oxbryta. SG&A for the first quarter was $75 million compared with $59 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased professional and consulting services associated with our expanded commercial and medical affairs operations for Oxbryta, including supporting the pediatric launch in the U.S. and launch readiness in geographies outside of the U.S., increased employee-related costs and operational growth, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense. Both R&D and SG&A expenses were slightly below our expectations in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that we now expect to be recognized later in 2022. Net loss for the first quarter was $81 million compared to $75 million for the same period in 2021. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the first quarter was $1.26 per share compared with $1.21 per share for the same period in 2021. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $662 million compared with $735 million at the end of 2021. Looking forward to the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate revenues in the range of $63 million to $65 million or sequential growth of 14% to 18%. We expect this will be driven by new prescription growth, including phasing in the first quarter, which was more back-end weighted in terms of growth of new prescriptions. And we expect this will be partially offset by an increase in gross to net and the timing of broad pediatric payer coverage. In summary, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we expect that revenue will grow over the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to be well positioned with a strong balance sheet allowing us to continue to make key investments for future growth. And with that, I will now turn the call over to DJ.\nDavid Johnson: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As I've done in the past, I will provide an update on three key metrics that will give you further insight into our progress. These metrics are: new prescriptions for Oxbryta, which informs underlying patient demand; the number of healthcare providers prescribing Oxbryta, which captures the progress we are making on adoption; and payer coverage, which speaks to the access environment for Oxbryta. First, new prescriptions. We delivered more than 1,200 new prescriptions during the quarter, our strongest demand quarter since Q1 of 2020. This was driven by the pediatric launch and incremental growth from the 12 and older group. Starting with the pediatric launch, we got off to a strong start in the quarter. We were able to leverage two years of Oxbryta education and awareness building from our original approval to quickly engage with healthcare providers on the pediatric label expansion and to train them on administering the new formulation in early January. Our team did an excellent job building excitement, particularly among pediatric hematologists and caregivers, and early feedback from this engagement has been overwhelmingly positive. This is reflected in the high number of new prescriptions in the quarter. Somewhat expected, the uptake in the pediatric population was strongest in the early part of the quarter when many physicians and patients have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to start Oxbryta therapy. As a result, many existing prescribers had some of their younger patients ready to initiate therapy shortly after approval. In terms of COVID-19, we did see some impact from Omicron in January, reflecting continued caution by SCD patients and caregivers. However, demand and field team access dynamics did improve in February as infections declined. Similarly, our market research shows that comfort levels for in-person care bounced back quickly in February with most patients and caregivers preferring in-person visits for routine care. And in February, HCPs we surveyed indicated that the majority of their SCD appointments were conducted in-person. This is a good leading indicator that things are likely to start trending back to more normal health care engagement this year. Feedback from our field teams supported what we heard from our market research. Anecdotally, our team saw patient volumes increase in February and March, with ongoing headwinds for COVID causing some adult patients to be cautious due to the increased risk to their health. On the provider side, we continue to see office turnover and staff shortages. And when we look at the claims data in Q1, SCD patient visits to HCP offices remain below pre-pandemic levels. We believe the net effect of all these trends contributed to the sequential growth in new prescriptions for the 12 and older age group, along with the momentum from our DTC and real-world evidence that was presented at ASH last year and recently published in expert review of hematology. We also believe the 12 and older segment benefited from HCP engagement around the pediatric launch, given that the majority of our targets treat a range of age groups. We also continue to see a broad range of patient characteristics for those prescribed Oxbryta, such as baseline hemoglobin and VOC burden suggesting that the prescribers are increasingly recognize the importance of addressing polymerization and long-term health. The COVID environment has remained relatively stable from mid Q1 through April, though we are closely watching the recent uptick in cases. Assuming COVID impact does not escalate, we anticipate that new prescriptions in the second quarter will be roughly flat compared to the first quarter. This reflects slightly lower pediatric new prescriptions following the strong start with patients that have been waiting for Oxbryta, offset by continued incremental improvement in the 12 and older group. Looking ahead to the second half of the year. If the environment continues to improve, we believe we have the potential to accelerate growth driven by our ongoing DTC campaign, new real-world data that we continue to publish and the pediatric launch. The key leading indicators that we see as predictive of a return to sustained quarter-over-quarter growth are improvements in the industry-wide new-to-brand prescriptions and our patients' health care visits returning to pre-pandemic levels. While we are hopeful this will occur, we know SCD patients remain cautious. For example, all the SCD focused community-based organization meetings planned for the second half of the year are taking place virtually. As we prepare for more SCD patients to potentially return to face to face interactions with their health care providers, we are working to raise overall Oxbryta awareness through our ongoing DTC campaign. The metrics from the campaign around targeted audience reach continue to exceed our original goals. In the first quarter, this was aided by several new tactics, including updating the campaign to reflect the pediatric approval and an improved ability to target SCD patients, which we believe contributed to a higher frequency of monthly engagement. In addition, we launched our branded and unbranded content on new channels, including YouTube, Pandora and podcasts. Visits to oxbryta.com and SickleCellSpeaks.com, reached an all-time high in the first quarter. We also are seeing encouraging growth in the number of SCD patients visiting their HCPs within one month of seeing our DTC advertisement. As we think about recent trends, the conversion rate for new prescriptions was consistent with prior quarters. Similarly, Oxbryta adherence, which includes compliance and persistence for patients in the first year of therapy, continued to be within the range of our prior quarter\u2019s and analogs. As we gain more data on adherence for year two and beyond, we are seeing lower adherence compared to year one as would be expected for any chronic medication. But we are encouraged that some patients in year one and beyond have restarted Oxbryta, and that Oxbryta adherence continues to trend better than SCD analogs. In addition, we continue to proactively roll out new tactics aimed at improving overall adherence, including long-term adherence. This includes additional services through our, a patient hub GBT Source Solutions, which continues to be an important driver of patient engagement and adherence. For example, early feedback on the email newsletters and mobile messaging that we launched around the end of 2021 has been encouraging. These services are also available to patients via our specialty pharmacies. And the data shows that patients engage with GBT Source or the similar services offered by these partners, have better adherence rates than those that do not. So we plan to continue investing and driving utilization of these programs. Next, my second metric, healthcare provider penetration. During the quarter, total interactions with healthcare providers increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which was lower due to the holidays and lingering impact of the Delta variant. And despite the impact of the Omicron variant in January, in-person visits continued to improve as they have for several quarters, reaching around 50% of our salesforce interactions with HCPs during the quarter. Against this backdrop, we added about 120 new prescribers in the quarter. This includes several prescribers from the 200 new targets we added for the pediatric launch. This group focuses almost entirely on patients that are 11 and younger. Encouragingly with the momentum from the pediatric launch on new prescribers and reengaging prior writers March was our highest month for the number of active prescribers in the last 12 months. When we look at the breakdown of writers, we continue to see prescriptions being written by both specialists and non-specialists, which we believe is a positive trend for the long-term trajectory for the long-term trajectory of the launch. Turning the payor coverage. We continue to have broad payor coverage for the 12 and older patient population with more than 90% of coverage lives, having access in the United States. And our focus is on making it easier for physicians to prescribe and patients to receive Oxbryta. In terms of coverage for the four to eleven age group, we made substantial progress and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of broad coverage by mid-2022, faster than we did with the adolescent and adult population. Before turning the call over to Kim, I also want to provide a brief update on our commercial activities in Europe. We are gaining experience with more than 100 patients participating in our early access programs across Germany, France, and the UK. And following our European Commission approval in February, we are working to launch Oxbryta in Germany in mid-May. We will have open pricing in Germany for the first year while we negotiate future reimbursement. There are around 3000 sickle cell patients in Germany, and we anticipate adoption will be gradual leading to minimal revenues for Europe in 2022. Separately, our team has also begun reimbursement negotiations in France and England. We have begun educating physicians in Europe, on Oxbryta, including plans for our robust presence at the European Hematology Association or EHA meeting in June. At EHA we plan to promote Oxbryta for the first time in Europe, engage with physicians, including our branded [indiscernible] and sponsor an educational program. We also recently held a successful internal launch meeting in Europe, where it was clear that our employees are excited about bringing Oxbryta to patients and to helping GBT achieve our mission around the world. And with that, Kim will now talk about the developments in our pipeline.\nKim Smith Whitley: Thank you, DJ. And good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will provide an update on our efforts to further expand Oxbryta\u2019s clinical evidence and geographic reach, and our progress advancing our pipeline. Following on our regulatory approval in the European Union in February, we submitted for marketing authorization in Great Britain and believe we are on track potential approval by midyear. As a reminder in the UK Oxbryta was granted approval of early access medicines scheme EAMS, which provides two key advantages. First, patients that meet the eligibility criteria can gain early pre-licensed access to Oxbryta. We are pleased that UK patients have already started on Oxbryta through the EAMS designation. Second, medicines under EAMS that receive marketing authorization by the MHRA, as well as a positive assessment by NICE, benefit from accelerated NHS, England commissioning. In support of the pediatric launch this week at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology or ASPO Conference, we will present results from the Oxbryta expanded access program for children with sickle cell disease, age four to eleven.  The EAP data reinforces the efficacy and safety of treatment with Oxbryta in these patients, as seen in the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. Those hope HOPE-KIDS 1 results were first presented at EHA last year and were published this April in pediatric blood and cancer. Importantly, the majority of patients in the EAP had improved scores as measured by the patient and clinical global impressions of change scale, indicating that Oxbryta treatment is positively impacting their lives. I also want to flag that a 77-patient, single center, real-world experience study of Oxbryta from Dr. Alan Anderson was published in late April in the European Journal of Hematology. Dr. Anderson presented this data, which showed a mean hemoglobin increase of two grams per deciliter and substantial improvements in patient quality of life at several meetings in 2021. At the Annual EHA meeting in June, we plan to present new Oxbryta, real world data and other studies that reflect our efforts to generate new data. EHA abstracts will be announced later this month and we are excited about our planned activities. Now let's turn to the pipeline. For inclacumab, our P-selectin inhibitor, we are enrolling patients in our two Phase 3 studies collectively named THRIVE. One is evaluating the reduction of VOCs over a 48-week treatment period based on inclacumab's potential for quarterly dosing. We believe this would be a meaningful improvement for patients compared to monthly dosing and aligns well with a typical sickle cell disease practice schedule of quarterly office visits. The other Phase 3 study is evaluating 90-day VOC, readmission rates, following an initial VOC hospitalization, which tragically occurs in around 50% of patients who experience an initial VOC. This study is enabled by inclacumab's profile and aligned with its best-in-class potential. We are continuing to focus on enrolling THRIVE as quickly as possible. Turning to GBT-601, our next-generation hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor that we believe has potential to be a best-in-class therapy. At EHA, we aim to share more data on GBT-601, including sickle cell disease patient EPO levels from the Phase 1 study. Separately, we aim to publish new preclinical data for GBT-601 in a peer-reviewed journal later this year. Based on the impressive data we reported at ASH in December, we are working to aggressively advance GBT-601. Our plan is to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with the goal of submitting for a full regulatory approval with FDA. We expect the Phase 2/3 design will allow us to advance more quickly into the pivotal Phase 3 portion and are working towards our goal of initiating the Phase 2 portion by mid-2022. The purpose of the Phase 2 portion is to identify the optimal dose to advance into Phase 3. As we explore higher doses, we believe they will lead to higher occupancy and hemoglobin increases, and importantly, consistently improve the red blood cell health of patients to resemble that of a sickle cell trait individual. We are also exploring a 150-milligram dose of GBT-601 with patients from our Phase 1 study. We are very excited that all six patients reach out to the clinical trial site wanting to restart therapy, providing us the opportunity to restart the study and explore a higher dose. In my experience, this is the first time I have seen the restart of a sickle cell study due to patient demand.  Patients will receive a 150-milligram daily maintenance dose for six weeks. We anticipate data from this portion of the study will be available by the end of the year and include the same key endpoints as the data we reported at ASH in December. I am proud of the progress we are making with GBT-601, over a short timeframe, while also continuing to drive enrollment in our inclacumab studies and advancing our Oxbryta studies. I firmly believe GBT has the leading clinical and pipeline programs in sickle cell disease. I'll now turn it back over to Ted.\nTed Love: Thank you, Kim. In closing, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Given our progress, we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Oxbryta and our pipeline, which provide multiple, new growth opportunities in the coming quarters and years. For Oxbryta, new prescriptions are improving and we believe we have additional upside with the anticipated increase in in-person patient visits. And as we raise awareness through our many ongoing efforts, including our DTC campaign, our compelling clinical data and our pediatric launch. We also continue to invest in the near-term opportunities in Germany, France in the UK, afforded by a recent European commission approval, with the goal of potential broader expansion over time to add another layer to Oxbryta\u2019s growth potential. In terms of innovation, we believe GBT is well positioned with what we view as the most comprehensive pipeline in sickle cell disease. And over the next several years, our goal is to have at least five medicines approved or in the clinic. This R&D goal is matched by our commitment to provide broader support to the SED community. On that note, I want to provide a brief update on potential federal legislation we are supporting that will provide new funding from multidisciplinary care teams across the lifespan of individuals living with sickle cell disease. This legislation is modeled after the federally funded hemophilia treatment centers, a network of 130 clinics that offer coordinated care to Americans living with hemophilia. The total package of $535 million would help the SED community several ways, including a dramatic increase in the funding for SED treatment centers. Currently, this funding is about $9 million per year, which is far below federal funding for other orphan diseases. The legislation would also fund 110 community-based organizations that support patients, families, and communities facing SED. If signed into law, this would be the most comprehensive piece of legislation for sickle cell in 50 years. In summary, we are well positioned to be the leader in sickle cell disease with multiple opportunities to positively impact the lives of the patients we serve. With that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Ritu Baral with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRitu Baral: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to drill down a little bit more into the distribution of NRxs sort of across the quarter? And maybe any color on what you\u2019re seeing in April? Can you just confirm that there was sort of a net increase in NRx numbers over the quarter? I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out if the pediatric bolus is over, but that growth is continuing into April. And then I have a follow-up.\nTed Love: Hi, Ritu. This is Ted. We\u2019ll ask DJ to answer that.\nDavid Johnson: Yes. Thank you, Ritu. Yes. So, we have seen an increase in net patients on Oxbryta in Q1 over Q4, just like we\u2019ve seen every quarter, the pool of patients on Oxbryta has increased. And of course, as you would expect, because we have the new indication in Q1, we did see some healthy growth, not only in top line enrollments in Q1 at 12 \u2013 over 1,200 new enrollments, but the total pool of patients also went up consistent with that. So, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not here to talk about Q2 results. I don\u2019t have a lot to talk about that. But we\u2019re certainly pleased with the overall performance in Q1. It\u2019s our strongest quarter from a pure demand perspective since the first quarter of approval two years ago.\nRitu Baral: And the pediatric bolus is pretty much over. Is that what you guys are anticipating internally?\nDavid Johnson: What I tried to convey in my prepared comments was that we did see the strongest enrollments in the early part of Q1. So signifying that all that work we\u2019ve done for two years, preparing the market, educating on Oxbryta. And of course, many of \u2013 in fact, two thirds of the prescribers in the pediatric pool of treaters are ones that we were already calling on for the two years because they also have 12-and-older patients. So yes, they had patients ready to go right when we got approval. And so that\u2019s why that would make sense that was the strongest months for us. So yes, we think we\u2019ve kind of gotten past that. Now, we\u2019re moving on to more of a consistent number of enrollments expected from the pediatric group going forward.\nRitu Baral: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on GBT601. What doses will you be investigating in the Phase 2a what\u2019s the sort of range of doses? And will you be pursuing a loading dose strategy again in this study? Thanks.\nKim Smith Whitley: Hi, Ritu, it\u2019s Kim. Yes, we are going to be pursuing a loading dose similar to what we did with the Phase 1, MAD 1 and MAD 2 phases. And then we will be using a daily maintenance dose of 150 milligrams.\nRitu Baral: In the Phase 2a? Great. Thanks for taking all the questions.\nKim Smith Whitley: So that\u2019s to clarify, Ritu, I\u2019m sorry. That was for the follow-up for the Phase 1. We have not disclosed a dose for the Phase 2 because, as you know, we are using Phase 2 for the dose finding portion. So that\u2019s just what\u2019s going to be going on with the additional Phase 1 restart.\nRitu Baral: Okay. And so the range of doses that you\u2019re going to use in that, that\u2019s to be determined?\nKim Smith Whitley: So, we are going to explore, of course, the doses that we looked at, at least in our Phase 1 and consider doses based on a 100 milligram and 150 milligram before we decide whether or not we will explore doses above that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Parry on the line for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get some additional detail on reinitiating the Phase 1 trial for GBT601. First, when could we expect to get an update on when patients will start getting dosed \u2013 and then I know that you spoke about the six patients, but is there a potential for a higher number of patients in the Phase 1? And then I just have one other question.\nKim Smith Whitley: We are anticipating to restart the six participants, hopefully, all six, but we are not planning on adding new participants to the Phase 1 portion.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. And then just one more on the NRx number. Are you able to give a breakdown on adults versus teens in 1Q for NRx? And then I\u2019m curious, in terms of the states that have gain coverage. Are any of these states from the key geographies? I know that you\u2019ve discussed 17 states with this high concentration of sickle cell disease patients? Any detail would be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Johnson: Yes. Regarding the NRxs, we\u2019re not breaking out NRx by age group. Our goal is to drive overall adoption with sickle cell patients in four and above. The pricing is the same and we know that these patients will matriculate into the 12-and-older category over time anyway. So another important dynamic to keep in mind is just that the 12-and-older population is still going to be the largest driver of growth going forward. It\u2019s by far the largest group of patients. So, we think just reporting on overall demand, overall enrollments every quarter gives you the best idea of how we\u2019re driving demand. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at that time. And I forget the second piece.\nUnidentified Analyst: The second question is related to specific states, if you\u2019re able to provide any detail on key geography states.\nDavid Johnson: Yes. We\u2019re getting prescriptions across the 17 states that make up 85% of our sickle cell patients. As you would imagine, that\u2019s where we\u2019re also the bulk of the pediatric patients near that same geographies, and we are getting prescriptions across the state you would expect.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Greg. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on your expectation around the growth trend in adult population going forward as the pandemic impact has gradually stabilized. What\u2019s your latest thinking around providing more long-term sales guidance and probably breaking down the revenues by age group?\nTed Love: So Jeff, do you want to take that, because you speak to the issue about revenue guidance in the long term. I think we have up to now, as you know, focused on giving quarterly guidance, and our plan has been to move to longer-term guidance, but we really want to make sure that we are somewhat beyond the pandemic. And we\u2019re not really sure if we\u2019re there yet. We\u2019re hopeful, but not really convinced that we\u2019re completely be there with some of the variants that could be popping up it. So\u2026\nJeff Farrow: That\u2019s exactly right, Ted. I think the biggest unknown that we have is what\u2019s going to happen with the potential additional variants popping up and the impact it might have to patients visiting their physicians, which is a big driver new Rxs. So \u2013 and I believe the part of your question to is what\u2019s our expectations on the 12 and above. We do anticipate that growing over time. We do expect to get back to sort of the level that we saw prior to the pandemic happening. It\u2019s going to take some time. One of the things that we\u2019ve referenced before in this past, given the fact that these patients haven\u2019t gotten in to visit their physicians previously, the first visit might be one of those health check-ins \u2013 like how are you doing? Let\u2019s talk generally what\u2019s going on? And then maybe the second visit, is where we talk about, hey, there\u2019s a couple of new medications out there for sickle cell, would you like to hear a little bit about that. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re anticipating it to be sort of a stepwise growth as opposed to a light switch in terms of growth there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jeffries.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Akash. So you have indicated a call. So previously, we noticed in the consensus estimate about 280 Oxbryta sales for 20 [ph] this year. And based on our math, this revenue implied about putting 100 new prescriptions per quarter for the rest of the year. Do you think that\u2019s a reasonable goal for this year? And in addition, previously, you mentioned you have a goal to reaching $15 billion market cap by 2025. We believe that suggests around $3 billion to $4 billion product sales. What are some signals you saw major confident to reaching that target in 2025? Thank you.\nTed Love: Yes, Jeff, you may want to take part of that, but I\u2019ll start off with the 2025 goal. So in building a company, you do want to set some aspirational goals for how you want to build a business. You want them to be realistic, though, as well. And one of the things that we did is that we looked at companies, which had actually moved from where we are today to a market cap of beyond $15 billion, we\u2019re in that range. And if you look at those companies, those companies tend to have multiple products either approved or looking very likely that they will be approved shortly. And we certainly think we\u2019re well positioned that with Oxbryta already approved with inclacumab in Phase 3 and with GBT601 being a program that we think we can move very aggressively with. And obviously, there\u2019s more opportunities. We do have things going on in research and we have the capacity to do deals. So, we think the 5% is achievable. We also know that companies that hit these numbers tend to have significant revenue. And obviously, we think Oxbryta has long-term potential of generating revenue. We\u2019re obviously growing our revenue quarter-over-quarter. And over the next couple of years, we think that the revenue could look like a company that has a position to be in that market cap. So there\u2019s nothing mathematical. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a program that tells you how to get to a market cap of $15 billion, but they\u2019re ingredients. And we think we\u2019ve got the fundamental ingredients to make it happen here.\nJeff Farrow: In reference to the patient numbers, we\u2019re really not in a position to speak to it because it does go hand-in-hand with revenue guidance. That said, I think what we\u2019ve previously said still holds true that we expect growth in the back half of this year. A couple of things that are going to be driving that is our hope that the pandemic will subside, and we\u2019ll start seeing more in-office visits, which will drive more NRxs. And then just a reminder that we still have to go through the payer process on the pediatric side. And so we expect to have broader coverage by the middle of this year, which, of course, will help revenues in the long run as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yanan Zhu with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nYanan Zhu: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress and the four to 11 age group launch. Two questions perhaps. The one on the guidance and the prescription numbers, is the \u2013 is that from this quarter\u2019s $55 million to the guidance for the next quarter at the middle point, $64 million revenue. How much of that is driven by the pediatric patients transitioning, I mean, four to 11 age group transitioning to insurance coverage and how much is that driven by increasing in demand? So that's my first question. Thanks.\nTed Love: Yes, and thanks for the question. We're not really in a position I think to bifurcate those out, but I think your point is a good one. As I mentioned on the previous question that we are still seeking broad payer coverage on the pediatric side. So obviously those patients that maybe weren't covered in the first quarter, becoming covered in Q2 will help us on that aspect of it but we also do anticipate growth overall in new prescriptions, somewhat incremental growth, but we do also expect some growth on the 12 and above as well. So generally I think what DJ had said was that we expect a, somewhat of a decrease on the pediatric side, the four to 11, just given the early access that happened there. But we do anticipate growth on the 12 and above side of prescriptions.\nJeff Farrow: Which we saw in this quarter as well, yes.\nYanan Zhu: Right, because, Jeff, I thought I heard you say when you were making the guidance, there is a phasing in part of consideration of that kind of dynamic. Basically that says in a sec back half of the first quarter, the demand is higher. So that's my understanding?\nJeff Farrow: That's correct. That is correct. Yes, particularly in the adults.\nYanan Zhu: Right, right. Yes, given that there is a bolus in \u2013 when the pediatrics was approved, which is I mid-February, so it sounds like there has to be adult growth in the back half of the quarter for that \u2013 for you to consider facing in into next quarter.\nJeff Farrow: Correct, yes.\nYanan Zhu: Thanks for explaining that. And my next, other question is on the 150 milligram dose, so could you talk about, obviously if you have to choose a dose, this is a dose you have chosen a higher dose. What's the hemoglobin occupancy that you think you'll get based on your modeling? And is there a possibility that you will do something similar to what you did before that is having a, like a second part with even higher dose with these six patients? Thank you.\nKim Smith Whitley: We anticipate with the modeling that obviously this will be adjusted because our original modeling was based on six participants. But when you look at those six participants, we should, with a 150 milligram dose get occupancies above 40%. So we are comfortable using those going into a Phase 2, but understand that we'll get much more data to support a model to find a dose out of the Phase 2 study.\nJeff Farrow: And I think one of the other things that's important to point out is that we looked and showed you all a fair amount of [indiscernible] data. And we showed that many of the parameters on these patients were beginning to approach normality. We would love to have them actually arrive at mimicking the blood from a sickle trait individual rather than someone from a sickle cell patient. So that's the rationale for going higher to see if we can recapitulate, that state that looks like sickle cell trait and no longer sickle cell disease.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nYatin Suneja: Hey guys, two questions. First, I just want to confirm the guidance is 63 to 65 for Q2, correct?\nJeff Farrow: Correct.\nYatin Suneja: Okay. So if we look at the midpoint, your guidance is actually implying about $9 million off additional growth in 2Q, which is exactly what you did in second quarter of 2021? And this is the guidance that you're providing despite having an expanded label or limited COVID headwinds, a lot more increase in NRx that you're seeing. So I'm just trying to understand why revenues are not growing at a higher rate when you have all these dynamic in your favor? And then also maybe comment that will they accelerate in Q3; just help us understand this dynamic?\nJeff Farrow: Sure, Yatin. It\u2019s a great question and it is something that we wanted to make sure was understood. The biggest issue in \u2013 there's a delta between the NRx growth and the revenue guidance that we're providing. The biggest issues are really three folders. One, we still don't have broad payer coverage on the pediatric side, so while we might be shipping bottles or having requests come in, we can't recognize revenues on that. So that's going to inhibit the revenue growth. The other aspect to a less extent is our increase in gross-to-net. And then finally we have a dynamic in Q2 similar to what we had in Q1, where the quarter ends on a Thursday. And we have seen is one of our customers especially distributor tends to buy on that date, but that shipment is not received until the following quarter. So there results a fairly large purchase that does not get recognized in the second quarter. So that's part of the rationale as well for the lower on the guidance.\nYatin Suneja: Got it. And then maybe just one more on the pediatric side, so of the 16,000 patients that you're targeting, can you just talk about realistically how many can be reached with Oxbryta mean, is it like 50%, 30% or higher? Just give us some number if you can in the longer term? Thank you.\nDavid Johnson: Yes, this with DJ. I don't think we've ever given a market share estimate for our sickle cell patients, including the adult patients for that matter. I think if you look at some of the analogs in the marketplace that should give you an idea of what we can likely achieve and exceed. I mean, if you look at hydroxyurea consistently is in the 30% of patients in any given year are on therapy. There's a lot of patient's cycle on and off therapy, but consistently about 30% of patients are on therapy in a given year. So that would be if you assume around 100,000 patients that's about a 30%, I guess patient share. With Oxbryta being a broad indication and now going down to four years old, it does open up the market to 100,000 sickle cell patients that are now qualified for Oxbryta. With really no restrictions to speak of in terms of hemoglobin levels or other conditions that would, it's a very broad indication. So we would expect to do at least as good as that over time, it's going to take time. We do need to fully come out of the pandemic. We talked about some of the headwinds still being patient visits to healthcare providers still lower than we needed to be, but we are expecting that to improve this year. So yes, so I think all of our pediatric patients in the four to 11 are really candidates for us, and we're going to work very hard to get them access to Oxbryta as quickly as possible.\nYatin Suneja: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Burnett with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nCarolina Ibanez: Hi, good afternoon. This is Carolina Ibanez on for Ben Burnett. Thank you for taking our question. Expanding up on a previous question what do you expect to show in terms follow-up time for the six patients that are going to be restarted in the 601 \u2013 in the higher dose 601 study, and that will be part of the data update later this year?\nJeff Farrow: Yes. You're talking about the follow up patient that we're restarting on therapy from Phase 1.\nCarolina Ibanez: Correct.\nJeff Farrow: We kind of said the toward the end of the year it's typically as where we try to present major news, depending upon when the patients we start, we would present all the data that we have. So it could be multiple months of treatment by that time.\nCarolina Ibanez: Okay. And a quick \u2013 and a second follow-up question for the pediatric patients do you have a sense for the adherence in this patient population?\nJeff Farrow: It's little early to have any adherence data. We only have a couple of months and in some cases, some patients are still awaiting to receive their first bottles and that sort of thing. So we don't have enough data yet, although we can look at our 12 and older population and we know for example that the 12 to 18 year olds in that group are actually the highest adherence. And so we think the younger the patients, and especially when the caregivers, the parents are involved we have the potential with the four to 11 year olds to have some of the best adherence yet. So we're excited to look at that and we should be able to talk about that more later in the year.\nCarolina Ibanez: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raju Prasad with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nRaju Prasad: Thanks for checking the questions. DJ, you just mentioned this kind of on the compliance rate in some of the younger patient populations. And do you guys have any data that supports kind of this from the early launch metrics that you're getting kind of repeat prescriptions from these younger patient populations. And if we're thinking about kind of pull through revenue in the next quarter, how much recurring revenue we could expect from kind of this bolus of new patients you brought in, in the first quarter? I got another one. Thanks.\nDavid Johnson: Yes, yes. I would just say that from a pediatric group in particular, we don't have enough data because they're really just getting going. So you need to look at that over time. It's really anecdotal from the clinicians that four to 11 year olds in the trials and the fully access programs, et cetera. And they would tell you that with the parents involved, the kids tend to do better on adherence. And we've seen in our own data that that the younger patients, the teenagers in our 12 and older category do in fact have better adherence than the adults. So we think everything's pointing towards better adherence. I would say that that, yes, over time what we've always said is that we want to be at least in the same category as the analogs, 50% to 70% adherence at the end of the first year therapy. We remain there right now with our therapies and we're going to watch it over time. We're putting a lot of resources towards supporting patients and we're hopeful that this year will be able to actually increase adherence in some groups over time.\nRaju Prasad: Great. And then can you remind me the gross-to-net that you said in your prepared remarks, and then maybe just give me directional \u2013 directionality on the gross-to-net and the pediatric cohort?\nJeff Farrow: Hey Raju, it's Jeff. So we had gross-to-net this quarter was about 16.3 and we do expect that to go up incrementally quarter-over-quarter to sort of a steady state of about 25% probably by midyear. I think it's better to look at it in aggregate because that's how we think about it. Particularly since price signal is flat between the two indications, but you are right there are more patients in the four to 11 age group that are on Medicaid as opposed to potentially being dual eligible on Medicaid and Medicare. So it is slightly higher gross-to-net on those patients, but in the aggregate we do expect to get to that 25% by middle of next year.\nRaju Prasad: Great. And then maybe just one last one on 601, you mentioned that it was kind of inbound interest from the patients to get back on drug and to study 150. Just kind of curious to know would that, I mean, is there any thoughts about expanding the SCD cohort or have more patients or is it just bringing those six patients back in that were washed out of drug and getting them back on drug to look at occupancy before the Phase 2? And then just kind of as a Part B to that question is there a chance that you might study two dose cohorts in the Phase 2 trial after this data? Thanks.\nJeff Farrow: Yes. So just to be clear, the plan was to do a proper Phase 2 study with dose ranging, and we're doing that. What happened with the six patients is that they called back and said, they'd like to go back on drug and we're opportunistic. So we thought that was fantastic news and an opportunity to oblige those patients and get more information, but that's not a subsidy for our Phase 2 study. So we're starting our Phase 2 study. That's where we're going to get the proper dose range. We're going to get more data from these six patients. But again, to be clear, it's not our Phase 2 study.\nRaju Prasad: Great. Thank you. And would you file amendment to increase the dose level in the Phase 2 2150 \u2013 or is that already included in the design?\nTed Love: The plan is to expose these six patients starting at 150. I think Kim had that in her prepared remarks. And in the proper Phase 2 study, we'll look at a variety of branches. We obviously have shown you data on 100 milligrams. We saw that, that produced about 32% modification. We saw the [indiscernible] data look very exciting, but the patients didn't get perfectly to sickle cell disease. So obviously, we're going to go higher, and we're going to go longer and we're going to get the data and make decisions based on the data. So it's a little bit hard to tell you what the dose is going to be until we actually do the study.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joon Lee with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJoon Lee: Hi, thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. Just following up on the previous question. Impressive that you're able to restart the trial, the Phase I trial for 601 due to patient demand. It's also highly unusual. Was there any particular clinical benefit that they missed and complained that drove them to demand that we start? And did this require any level of dialogue with the FDA to get this restarted. Thank you.\nKim Smith Whitley: We were really pleased to see that participants in the Phase 1 were interested in restarting 601. I think that what we're pleased with in the development of 601 is we have data from Oxbryta to go on. And as you know, in our HOPE trials, we had a global impression of health overall that shows that individuals felt better when they were receiving Oxbryta. So it's not inconsistent to think that individuals felt better and that was one of the reasons that they were interested in restarting. However, we did not query specifically why they were interested. But I think that just from knowing our Oxbryta experience, I would suggests that they may have felt better while on 601.\nJoon Lee: Did this restart required a consent from the FDA or in any way?\nKim Smith Whitley: Well, I think that one of the things that is very interesting about this approach is that using intrapatient or intra participant dose escalation is kind of standard within our drug development. So I don't think that this really required an additional discussion with FDA. I think that what we did was pretty conservative. We looked at two doses, then we looked at our safety tolerability profile and analyzed the data before we offered an increase in dose for the participants restarting.\nTed Love: I mean, of course, I was of course, our protocols and things are filed with the FDA. So there's nothing FDA is not aware of. And our safety data from Phase 1 has been shared widely as well. So we feel good about the profile. And I would just add, I mean while we didn't do formal testing of the patients or how they felt, my suspicion is that they came back and said they wanted to go back on drug. They must have had something desirable, but we did not formally collect anything.\nJoon Lee: Right. No, because when I \u2013 when we did our touches, they said that the patients just felt better \u2013 and it's just such a big descriptor. So I just want to understand what aspect of this clinical improvement they were localizing just that was a curiosity. But I mean, it's good, but...\nTed Love: Yes. That \u2013 so I mean many of these patients with one, two, three gram increase in hemoglobin, they feel more like they can get their normal activities done. They \u2013 I mean, if you were anemic with a hemoglobin of, you wouldn't feel normal. And if it increased to 10%, you would definitely feel better. So I think a lot of it is that. Some patients have also complained that they have kind of daily pain that gets better when they have fewer sickle cells, presumably on treatment. But again, we didn't do anything formal. So we don't want to project it is if we get something formal. We are just being clear that the patients did come back and say, we want to go back on the therapy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tessa Romero with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTessa Romero: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. The first one is, can you provide a little bit more color on what you are seeing with respect to in-office healthcare professional visits with sickle cell disease patients by age group, are there any differences that are noteworthy? And then I had one follow-up on the 601.\nDavid Johnson: Yes, I'd be happy to share some of the information. We \u2013 every quarter, we take a look at the claims data for sickle cell patients, and it still is below pre-pandemic levels in terms of health care visits across the board. When you look at it for 12 and older versus 4 to 11, the 4 to 11 are actually even farther below baseline. And the reason for that is because recall that the vaccinations for the younger kids has been slower and haven't gotten to all of them yet. So parents are very cautious about getting their kids in and around the health care system and out and about when they have sickle cell disease and could potentially contract COVID. So that's why those health care visits are down. It has everything to do with COVID risk or our patients being at risk for poor outcomes if they catch it. So they're just being cautious. They're being smart and the kids are being especially, I guess, conservative. So that's still the case today. Although, as I also said in my prepared remarks, our market research suggests that physicians and patients are feeling more optimistic about getting back in person our reps are getting back in person at higher levels now. So we think this is all a good sign and a leading indicator that we're going to get there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Choi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Choi: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking our questions. My first question is commercial. And just going back perhaps to DJ's earlier comments with regard to a substantial portion of the growth coming from the pediatric population. I want to maybe just understand a little better as to why the 12 and older population growth here seems to be relatively flat. Is it just in terms of understanding slower NRx dynamics? Or is it \u2013 has it been just sort of issues with regard to adherence broadly over the population as to why this portion of the revenue mix has been relatively flat over the past few quarters? And then I had a follow-up question.\nTed Love: Yes. Just to be clear, I want DJ to answer, but just to be clear, it wasn't flat. There was obviously new patients coming in the four to 11 because that was just approved, but there was growth in the 12 and older. I think I want to make sure we want to be clear about that.\nDavid Johnson: Yes, that's exactly right, Ted. We've seen growth across the board, of course, substantial growth in the four to 11 given that it's new. But we do see growth also in the adults being reinitiated now as we've gotten this approval. There's it makes a lot of sense as well. Many of the physicians that are now treating the four to 11-year olds also have patients in the 12 and older. And as they \u2013 as we got approval, in a broader set of patients and the FDA wanting it to get to lower ages. That's also a great signal to our clinicians that this drug has even more experience, has been tested and proven in the marketplace now. The real-world evidence is stronger than it's ever been. So for all these reasons, there's more confidence using Oxbryta across the board. And in fact, in the 12- to 18-year-old group, we saw some reasonable growth as well, suggesting that yet, some of those same physicians that are now using it in four to 11 are now initiating it in their \u2013 in their 12 to 18 year olds as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask two things related to 601. So First, can you just remind us how much tox data you have and how long you can dose patients for with 601 right now, if there are any restrictions related to preclinical talks. And then second \u2013 what are the headwinds to starting the Phase 2/3 just in terms of this operational things? Or are there other things you're still considering related to dose and still doing some modeling and things like that? Thanks very much.\nKim Smith Whitley: Yes. We're on target with our toxicology studies, there's no limitation for dose increasing based on that. And then the second part of your question was regarding...\nMatthew Harrison: So I guess I was asking more around if there's any limitation on duration of dosing related to the tox studies that you've done, I don't know if you've done all of the longer-term tox studies, and that has an implication on duration. And then second, I was just asking around the Phase 2/3 study in terms of getting that started. What are you waiting for to get that started? Thanks.\nKim Smith Whitley: Yes. So there's no limitation on duration as well. And the \u2013 really the goal of the Phase 2/3 study will be, of course, with the Phase 2 to do dose finding and then to go over into a Phase 3 without having to start a new Phase 3 study. And there is really no limitation on the start of the Phase 2 other than the completion of the protocol, getting the sites on board and those study-related factors.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Li Watsek with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\nLi Watsek: Hey guys congrats and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'm just wondering if you can comment a little more on the new prescription growth in Q1. What is sort of the relative contribution from I guess, improved cover situation versus sort of this new expansion to younger kids? And where do you see the trends go this year? And also, I guess, on the expansion into the pediatric population, can you talk about maybe the dynamics that you've seen in younger kids relative to adults? And are there any particular concerns from I guess, pediatric prescribers that you may call out and on penetration into this group. Is it mostly a function of access? Or are there any other considerations here as well. Thanks.\nDavid Johnson: Yes, I can take that one. So yes, as we said in our prepared remarks, the NRx \u2013 we're not breaking it out by age group. We're looking at overall demand. We're super excited about having over 1,200 enrollments in the quarter, the highest we've had in over well, about two years and for a quarter, and that's really driven by both groups, the four to 11-year olds as well as the 12 and older. We saw growth in both those groups. In terms of dynamics in the kids versus adults. Yes, I mean, in general, pediatricians tend to be parents to be pretty cautious about what you put in the kid. So they're going to want to see and be convinced of a lot of the data. The good news is we got this indication after being on the market for two years. We have a wealth of real-world experience, safety data and experience in the real world. So we have a new formulation, for example, that was developed specifically for the kids that can be dissolved and into a liquid and given to the kids that way. And lots of great patient education and parent and caregiver education that goes with it. So we're set there. In terms of concerns, no new concerns. I mean if you think about it mechanistically, this is the exact place we should be going. The younger the population stopping sickling and preventing polymerization early should have the best impact on preventing downstream effects of sickle cell disease. So we're super excited about that, and we think the parents are as well. And then penetration-wise, we're very excited about being indicated across the board for all sickle cell patients ages four and older now. So we should be able to, over time be able to grow into more and more patients.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ted Love for any closing comments.\nTed Love: Okay. I'd just like to end by thanking everyone for joining the call today. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. And please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ted. Total net revenue from sales of Oxbryta was $55.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, in line with our guidance of $54 million to $56 million; first quarter revenue increased by approximately $16 million or 41% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, first quarter revenue declined slightly from the fourth quarter. This reflects the anticipated work down of inventory during the quarter following increased purchases by distributors at the end of the fourth quarter, an incremental increase in gross to net and the impact of Omicron variant in the first part of the quarter. These drivers were partially offset by the continued increase in the net number of patients on Oxbryta, days of inventory on hand at the end of the first quarter was in line with historical levels. Gross to net was 16.3% for the quarter, around 0.5% increase from the fourth quarter, primarily related to increased patient co-pay support as commercial insurance out-of-pocket deductibles reset for patients for the new year as well as higher 340B and Medicaid accruals in the quarter. Now turning to expenses. Cost of sales for the quarter was $1 million compared with $600,000 for the first quarter of 2021, which represents a slight increase on a percentage of sales basis. Cost of sales is anticipated to increase in 2022 as we begin to finish utilizing the remainder of our fully expensed inventory that was previously recorded as R&D expense. R&D expense for the first quarter was $53 million compared with $51 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to an increase in external costs related to GBT601, partially offset by a decrease in external costs related to Oxbryta. SG&A for the first quarter was $75 million compared with $59 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to increased professional and consulting services associated with our expanded commercial and medical affairs operations for Oxbryta, including supporting the pediatric launch in the U.S. and launch readiness in geographies outside of the U.S., increased employee-related costs and operational growth, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash stock compensation expense. Both R&D and SG&A expenses were slightly below our expectations in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that we now expect to be recognized later in 2022. Net loss for the first quarter was $81 million compared to $75 million for the same period in 2021. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the first quarter was $1.26 per share compared with $1.21 per share for the same period in 2021. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $662 million compared with $735 million at the end of 2021. Looking forward to the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate revenues in the range of $63 million to $65 million or sequential growth of 14% to 18%. We expect this will be driven by new prescription growth, including phasing in the first quarter, which was more back-end weighted in terms of growth of new prescriptions. And we expect this will be partially offset by an increase in gross to net and the timing of broad pediatric payer coverage. In summary, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and we expect that revenue will grow over the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to be well positioned with a strong balance sheet allowing us to continue to make key investments for future growth. And with that, I will now turn the call over to DJ. That's exactly right, Ted. I think the biggest unknown that we have is what's going to happen with the potential additional variants popping up and the impact it might have to patients visiting their physicians, which is a big driver new Rxs. So \u2013 and I believe the part of your question to is what's our expectations on the 12 and above. We do anticipate that growing over time. We do expect to get back to sort of the level that we saw prior to the pandemic happening. It's going to take some time. One of the things that we've referenced before in this past, given the fact that these patients haven't gotten in to visit their physicians previously, the first visit might be one of those health check-ins \u2013 like how are you doing? Let's talk generally what's going on? And then maybe the second visit, is where we talk about, hey, there's a couple of new medications out there for sickle cell, would you like to hear a little bit about that. So that's why we're anticipating it to be sort of a stepwise growth as opposed to a light switch in terms of growth there. In reference to the patient numbers, we're really not in a position to speak to it because it does go hand-in-hand with revenue guidance. That said, I think what we've previously said still holds true that we expect growth in the back half of this year. A couple of things that are going to be driving that is our hope that the pandemic will subside, and we'll start seeing more in-office visits, which will drive more NRxs. And then just a reminder that we still have to go through the payer process on the pediatric side. And so we expect to have broader coverage by the middle of this year, which, of course, will help revenues in the long run as well. Which we saw in this quarter as well, yes. That's correct. That is correct. Yes, particularly in the adults. Correct, yes. And I think one of the other things that's important to point out is that we looked and showed you all a fair amount of [indiscernible] data. And we showed that many of the parameters on these patients were beginning to approach normality. We would love to have them actually arrive at mimicking the blood from a sickle trait individual rather than someone from a sickle cell patient. So that's the rationale for going higher to see if we can recapitulate, that state that looks like sickle cell trait and no longer sickle cell disease. Correct. Sure, Yatin. It's a great question and it is something that we wanted to make sure was understood. The biggest issue in \u2013 there's a delta between the NRx growth and the revenue guidance that we're providing. The biggest issues are really three folders. One, we still don't have broad payer coverage on the pediatric side, so while we might be shipping bottles or having requests come in, we can't recognize revenues on that. So that's going to inhibit the revenue growth. The other aspect to a less extent is our increase in gross-to-net. And then finally we have a dynamic in Q2 similar to what we had in Q1, where the quarter ends on a Thursday. And we have seen is one of our customers especially distributor tends to buy on that date, but that shipment is not received until the following quarter. So there results a fairly large purchase that does not get recognized in the second quarter. So that's part of the rationale as well for the lower on the guidance. Yes. You're talking about the follow up patient that we're restarting on therapy from Phase 1. We kind of said the toward the end of the year it's typically as where we try to present major news, depending upon when the patients we start, we would present all the data that we have. So it could be multiple months of treatment by that time. It's little early to have any adherence data. We only have a couple of months and in some cases, some patients are still awaiting to receive their first bottles and that sort of thing. So we don't have enough data yet, although we can look at our 12 and older population and we know for example that the 12 to 18 year olds in that group are actually the highest adherence. And so we think the younger the patients, and especially when the caregivers, the parents are involved we have the potential with the four to 11 year olds to have some of the best adherence yet. So we're excited to look at that and we should be able to talk about that more later in the year. Hey Raju, it's Jeff. So we had gross-to-net this quarter was about 16.3 and we do expect that to go up incrementally quarter-over-quarter to sort of a steady state of about 25% probably by midyear. I think it's better to look at it in aggregate because that's how we think about it. Particularly since price signal is flat between the two indications, but you are right there are more patients in the four to 11 age group that are on Medicaid as opposed to potentially being dual eligible on Medicaid and Medicare. So it is slightly higher gross-to-net on those patients, but in the aggregate we do expect to get to that 25% by middle of next year. Yes. So just to be clear, the plan was to do a proper Phase 2 study with dose ranging, and we're doing that. What happened with the six patients is that they called back and said, they'd like to go back on drug and we're opportunistic. So we thought that was fantastic news and an opportunity to oblige those patients and get more information, but that's not a subsidy for our Phase 2 study. So we're starting our Phase 2 study. That's where we're going to get the proper dose range. We're going to get more data from these six patients. But again, to be clear, it's not our Phase 2 study."

            "name": "Ted Love",
            "content": "Thank you, Steven, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a notable start to the year for GBT, highlighted by strong sequential growth in new prescriptions of Oxbryta, including a promising start to our launch in patient ages 4 to 11. The early feedback and metrics on the pediatric launch have been encouraging. For example, we've already secured coverage with many important payers for this expanded indication. In patient ages 12 and older, we had our best result for new prescriptions in several quarters. We are optimistic that this momentum will continue if our key growth drivers increased overall awareness and interest in Oxbryta as we expect. In addition, we are hopeful that the COVID-19 environment will continue to improve given the significant headwinds it has caused for delivery of regular in-person care for patients with SCD. With respect to Europe, we continue to make exciting progress. Following the marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the European Commission in February, we completed regulatory activities to put us on track for a potential approval in Great Britain by mid-year. We kicked off reimbursement discussions in Germany, France and England and continue to enroll patients in our early access program. We also began educating HCPs on Oxbryta and have robust activities planned for launch in Germany very soon and for the EHA meeting in June. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to aggressively advance our clinical programs while exploring additional therapeutic targets in SCD and other red blood cell disorders. For GBT601, we plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial by mid-2022. And later in the call, Kim will provide an exciting update on the restart of our Phase 1 study based on patient interest. Altogether, we are well positioned to continue delivering for patients with SCD. We have continued to build momentum with Oxbryta both in the U.S. and internationally, and we are advancing what we believe is the most comprehensive pipeline in sickle cell disease. Our dedication to supporting the SCD community has never been stronger, and our progress with these and other efforts are highlighted in our recently published 2021 ESG report. With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to review the first quarter 2022 results. Thank you, Kim. In closing, we are off to a strong start in 2022. Given our progress, we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Oxbryta and our pipeline, which provide multiple, new growth opportunities in the coming quarters and years. For Oxbryta, new prescriptions are improving and we believe we have additional upside with the anticipated increase in in-person patient visits. And as we raise awareness through our many ongoing efforts, including our DTC campaign, our compelling clinical data and our pediatric launch. We also continue to invest in the near-term opportunities in Germany, France in the UK, afforded by a recent European commission approval, with the goal of potential broader expansion over time to add another layer to Oxbryta's growth potential. In terms of innovation, we believe GBT is well positioned with what we view as the most comprehensive pipeline in sickle cell disease. And over the next several years, our goal is to have at least five medicines approved or in the clinic. This R&D goal is matched by our commitment to provide broader support to the SED community. On that note, I want to provide a brief update on potential federal legislation we are supporting that will provide new funding from multidisciplinary care teams across the lifespan of individuals living with sickle cell disease. This legislation is modeled after the federally funded hemophilia treatment centers, a network of 130 clinics that offer coordinated care to Americans living with hemophilia. The total package of $535 million would help the SED community several ways, including a dramatic increase in the funding for SED treatment centers. Currently, this funding is about $9 million per year, which is far below federal funding for other orphan diseases. The legislation would also fund 110 community-based organizations that support patients, families, and communities facing SED. If signed into law, this would be the most comprehensive piece of legislation for sickle cell in 50 years. In summary, we are well positioned to be the leader in sickle cell disease with multiple opportunities to positively impact the lives of the patients we serve. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator? Hi, Ritu. This is Ted. We'll ask DJ to answer that. So Jeff, do you want to take that, because you speak to the issue about revenue guidance in the long term. I think we have up to now, as you know, focused on giving quarterly guidance, and our plan has been to move to longer-term guidance, but we really want to make sure that we are somewhat beyond the pandemic. And we're not really sure if we're there yet. We're hopeful, but not really convinced that we're completely be there with some of the variants that could be popping up it. So... Yes, Jeff, you may want to take part of that, but I'll start off with the 2025 goal. So in building a company, you do want to set some aspirational goals for how you want to build a business. You want them to be realistic, though, as well. And one of the things that we did is that we looked at companies, which had actually moved from where we are today to a market cap of beyond $15 billion, we're in that range. And if you look at those companies, those companies tend to have multiple products either approved or looking very likely that they will be approved shortly. And we certainly think we're well positioned that with Oxbryta already approved with inclacumab in Phase 3 and with GBT601 being a program that we think we can move very aggressively with. And obviously, there's more opportunities. We do have things going on in research and we have the capacity to do deals. So, we think the 5% is achievable. We also know that companies that hit these numbers tend to have significant revenue. And obviously, we think Oxbryta has long-term potential of generating revenue. We're obviously growing our revenue quarter-over-quarter. And over the next couple of years, we think that the revenue could look like a company that has a position to be in that market cap. So there's nothing mathematical. I don't think there's a program that tells you how to get to a market cap of $15 billion, but they're ingredients. And we think we've got the fundamental ingredients to make it happen here. Yes, and thanks for the question. We're not really in a position I think to bifurcate those out, but I think your point is a good one. As I mentioned on the previous question that we are still seeking broad payer coverage on the pediatric side. So obviously those patients that maybe weren't covered in the first quarter, becoming covered in Q2 will help us on that aspect of it but we also do anticipate growth overall in new prescriptions, somewhat incremental growth, but we do also expect some growth on the 12 and above as well. So generally I think what DJ had said was that we expect a, somewhat of a decrease on the pediatric side, the four to 11, just given the early access that happened there. But we do anticipate growth on the 12 and above side of prescriptions. The plan is to expose these six patients starting at 150. I think Kim had that in her prepared remarks. And in the proper Phase 2 study, we'll look at a variety of branches. We obviously have shown you data on 100 milligrams. We saw that, that produced about 32% modification. We saw the [indiscernible] data look very exciting, but the patients didn't get perfectly to sickle cell disease. So obviously, we're going to go higher, and we're going to go longer and we're going to get the data and make decisions based on the data. So it's a little bit hard to tell you what the dose is going to be until we actually do the study. I mean, of course, I was of course, our protocols and things are filed with the FDA. So there's nothing FDA is not aware of. And our safety data from Phase 1 has been shared widely as well. So we feel good about the profile. And I would just add, I mean while we didn't do formal testing of the patients or how they felt, my suspicion is that they came back and said they wanted to go back on drug. They must have had something desirable, but we did not formally collect anything. Yes. That \u2013 so I mean many of these patients with one, two, three gram increase in hemoglobin, they feel more like they can get their normal activities done. They \u2013 I mean, if you were anemic with a hemoglobin of, you wouldn't feel normal. And if it increased to 10%, you would definitely feel better. So I think a lot of it is that. Some patients have also complained that they have kind of daily pain that gets better when they have fewer sickle cells, presumably on treatment. But again, we didn't do anything formal. So we don't want to project it is if we get something formal. We are just being clear that the patients did come back and say, we want to go back on the therapy. Yes. Just to be clear, I want DJ to answer, but just to be clear, it wasn't flat. There was obviously new patients coming in the four to 11 because that was just approved, but there was growth in the 12 and older. I think I want to make sure we want to be clear about that. Okay. I'd just like to end by thanking everyone for joining the call today. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. And please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions. Thank you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "David Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As I've done in the past, I will provide an update on three key metrics that will give you further insight into our progress. These metrics are: new prescriptions for Oxbryta, which informs underlying patient demand; the number of healthcare providers prescribing Oxbryta, which captures the progress we are making on adoption; and payer coverage, which speaks to the access environment for Oxbryta. First, new prescriptions. We delivered more than 1,200 new prescriptions during the quarter, our strongest demand quarter since Q1 of 2020. This was driven by the pediatric launch and incremental growth from the 12 and older group. Starting with the pediatric launch, we got off to a strong start in the quarter. We were able to leverage two years of Oxbryta education and awareness building from our original approval to quickly engage with healthcare providers on the pediatric label expansion and to train them on administering the new formulation in early January. Our team did an excellent job building excitement, particularly among pediatric hematologists and caregivers, and early feedback from this engagement has been overwhelmingly positive. This is reflected in the high number of new prescriptions in the quarter. Somewhat expected, the uptake in the pediatric population was strongest in the early part of the quarter when many physicians and patients have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to start Oxbryta therapy. As a result, many existing prescribers had some of their younger patients ready to initiate therapy shortly after approval. In terms of COVID-19, we did see some impact from Omicron in January, reflecting continued caution by SCD patients and caregivers. However, demand and field team access dynamics did improve in February as infections declined. Similarly, our market research shows that comfort levels for in-person care bounced back quickly in February with most patients and caregivers preferring in-person visits for routine care. And in February, HCPs we surveyed indicated that the majority of their SCD appointments were conducted in-person. This is a good leading indicator that things are likely to start trending back to more normal health care engagement this year. Feedback from our field teams supported what we heard from our market research. Anecdotally, our team saw patient volumes increase in February and March, with ongoing headwinds for COVID causing some adult patients to be cautious due to the increased risk to their health. On the provider side, we continue to see office turnover and staff shortages. And when we look at the claims data in Q1, SCD patient visits to HCP offices remain below pre-pandemic levels. We believe the net effect of all these trends contributed to the sequential growth in new prescriptions for the 12 and older age group, along with the momentum from our DTC and real-world evidence that was presented at ASH last year and recently published in expert review of hematology. We also believe the 12 and older segment benefited from HCP engagement around the pediatric launch, given that the majority of our targets treat a range of age groups. We also continue to see a broad range of patient characteristics for those prescribed Oxbryta, such as baseline hemoglobin and VOC burden suggesting that the prescribers are increasingly recognize the importance of addressing polymerization and long-term health. The COVID environment has remained relatively stable from mid Q1 through April, though we are closely watching the recent uptick in cases. Assuming COVID impact does not escalate, we anticipate that new prescriptions in the second quarter will be roughly flat compared to the first quarter. This reflects slightly lower pediatric new prescriptions following the strong start with patients that have been waiting for Oxbryta, offset by continued incremental improvement in the 12 and older group. Looking ahead to the second half of the year. If the environment continues to improve, we believe we have the potential to accelerate growth driven by our ongoing DTC campaign, new real-world data that we continue to publish and the pediatric launch. The key leading indicators that we see as predictive of a return to sustained quarter-over-quarter growth are improvements in the industry-wide new-to-brand prescriptions and our patients' health care visits returning to pre-pandemic levels. While we are hopeful this will occur, we know SCD patients remain cautious. For example, all the SCD focused community-based organization meetings planned for the second half of the year are taking place virtually. As we prepare for more SCD patients to potentially return to face to face interactions with their health care providers, we are working to raise overall Oxbryta awareness through our ongoing DTC campaign. The metrics from the campaign around targeted audience reach continue to exceed our original goals. In the first quarter, this was aided by several new tactics, including updating the campaign to reflect the pediatric approval and an improved ability to target SCD patients, which we believe contributed to a higher frequency of monthly engagement. In addition, we launched our branded and unbranded content on new channels, including YouTube, Pandora and podcasts. Visits to oxbryta.com and SickleCellSpeaks.com, reached an all-time high in the first quarter. We also are seeing encouraging growth in the number of SCD patients visiting their HCPs within one month of seeing our DTC advertisement. As we think about recent trends, the conversion rate for new prescriptions was consistent with prior quarters. Similarly, Oxbryta adherence, which includes compliance and persistence for patients in the first year of therapy, continued to be within the range of our prior quarter's and analogs. As we gain more data on adherence for year two and beyond, we are seeing lower adherence compared to year one as would be expected for any chronic medication. But we are encouraged that some patients in year one and beyond have restarted Oxbryta, and that Oxbryta adherence continues to trend better than SCD analogs. In addition, we continue to proactively roll out new tactics aimed at improving overall adherence, including long-term adherence. This includes additional services through our, a patient hub GBT Source Solutions, which continues to be an important driver of patient engagement and adherence. For example, early feedback on the email newsletters and mobile messaging that we launched around the end of 2021 has been encouraging. These services are also available to patients via our specialty pharmacies. And the data shows that patients engage with GBT Source or the similar services offered by these partners, have better adherence rates than those that do not. So we plan to continue investing and driving utilization of these programs. Next, my second metric, healthcare provider penetration. During the quarter, total interactions with healthcare providers increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which was lower due to the holidays and lingering impact of the Delta variant. And despite the impact of the Omicron variant in January, in-person visits continued to improve as they have for several quarters, reaching around 50% of our salesforce interactions with HCPs during the quarter. Against this backdrop, we added about 120 new prescribers in the quarter. This includes several prescribers from the 200 new targets we added for the pediatric launch. This group focuses almost entirely on patients that are 11 and younger. Encouragingly with the momentum from the pediatric launch on new prescribers and reengaging prior writers March was our highest month for the number of active prescribers in the last 12 months. When we look at the breakdown of writers, we continue to see prescriptions being written by both specialists and non-specialists, which we believe is a positive trend for the long-term trajectory for the long-term trajectory of the launch. Turning the payor coverage. We continue to have broad payor coverage for the 12 and older patient population with more than 90% of coverage lives, having access in the United States. And our focus is on making it easier for physicians to prescribe and patients to receive Oxbryta. In terms of coverage for the four to eleven age group, we made substantial progress and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of broad coverage by mid-2022, faster than we did with the adolescent and adult population. Before turning the call over to Kim, I also want to provide a brief update on our commercial activities in Europe. We are gaining experience with more than 100 patients participating in our early access programs across Germany, France, and the UK. And following our European Commission approval in February, we are working to launch Oxbryta in Germany in mid-May. We will have open pricing in Germany for the first year while we negotiate future reimbursement. There are around 3000 sickle cell patients in Germany, and we anticipate adoption will be gradual leading to minimal revenues for Europe in 2022. Separately, our team has also begun reimbursement negotiations in France and England. We have begun educating physicians in Europe, on Oxbryta, including plans for our robust presence at the European Hematology Association or EHA meeting in June. At EHA we plan to promote Oxbryta for the first time in Europe, engage with physicians, including our branded [indiscernible] and sponsor an educational program. We also recently held a successful internal launch meeting in Europe, where it was clear that our employees are excited about bringing Oxbryta to patients and to helping GBT achieve our mission around the world. And with that, Kim will now talk about the developments in our pipeline. Yes. Thank you, Ritu. Yes. So, we have seen an increase in net patients on Oxbryta in Q1 over Q4, just like we've seen every quarter, the pool of patients on Oxbryta has increased. And of course, as you would expect, because we have the new indication in Q1, we did see some healthy growth, not only in top line enrollments in Q1 at 12 \u2013 over 1,200 new enrollments, but the total pool of patients also went up consistent with that. So, we haven't \u2013 we're not here to talk about Q2 results. I don't have a lot to talk about that. But we're certainly pleased with the overall performance in Q1. It's our strongest quarter from a pure demand perspective since the first quarter of approval two years ago. What I tried to convey in my prepared comments was that we did see the strongest enrollments in the early part of Q1. So signifying that all that work we've done for two years, preparing the market, educating on Oxbryta. And of course, many of \u2013 in fact, two thirds of the prescribers in the pediatric pool of treaters are ones that we were already calling on for the two years because they also have 12-and-older patients. So yes, they had patients ready to go right when we got approval. And so that's why that would make sense that was the strongest months for us. So yes, we think we've kind of gotten past that. Now, we're moving on to more of a consistent number of enrollments expected from the pediatric group going forward. Yes. Regarding the NRxs, we're not breaking out NRx by age group. Our goal is to drive overall adoption with sickle cell patients in four and above. The pricing is the same and we know that these patients will matriculate into the 12-and-older category over time anyway. So another important dynamic to keep in mind is just that the 12-and-older population is still going to be the largest driver of growth going forward. It's by far the largest group of patients. So, we think just reporting on overall demand, overall enrollments every quarter gives you the best idea of how we're driving demand. So that's where we're at that time. And I forget the second piece. Yes. We're getting prescriptions across the 17 states that make up 85% of our sickle cell patients. As you would imagine, that's where we're also the bulk of the pediatric patients near that same geographies, and we are getting prescriptions across the state you would expect. Yes, this with DJ. I don't think we've ever given a market share estimate for our sickle cell patients, including the adult patients for that matter. I think if you look at some of the analogs in the marketplace that should give you an idea of what we can likely achieve and exceed. I mean, if you look at hydroxyurea consistently is in the 30% of patients in any given year are on therapy. There's a lot of patient's cycle on and off therapy, but consistently about 30% of patients are on therapy in a given year. So that would be if you assume around 100,000 patients that's about a 30%, I guess patient share. With Oxbryta being a broad indication and now going down to four years old, it does open up the market to 100,000 sickle cell patients that are now qualified for Oxbryta. With really no restrictions to speak of in terms of hemoglobin levels or other conditions that would, it's a very broad indication. So we would expect to do at least as good as that over time, it's going to take time. We do need to fully come out of the pandemic. We talked about some of the headwinds still being patient visits to healthcare providers still lower than we needed to be, but we are expecting that to improve this year. So yes, so I think all of our pediatric patients in the four to 11 are really candidates for us, and we're going to work very hard to get them access to Oxbryta as quickly as possible. Yes, yes. I would just say that from a pediatric group in particular, we don't have enough data because they're really just getting going. So you need to look at that over time. It's really anecdotal from the clinicians that four to 11 year olds in the trials and the fully access programs, et cetera. And they would tell you that with the parents involved, the kids tend to do better on adherence. And we've seen in our own data that that the younger patients, the teenagers in our 12 and older category do in fact have better adherence than the adults. So we think everything's pointing towards better adherence. I would say that that, yes, over time what we've always said is that we want to be at least in the same category as the analogs, 50% to 70% adherence at the end of the first year therapy. We remain there right now with our therapies and we're going to watch it over time. We're putting a lot of resources towards supporting patients and we're hopeful that this year will be able to actually increase adherence in some groups over time. Yes, I'd be happy to share some of the information. We \u2013 every quarter, we take a look at the claims data for sickle cell patients, and it still is below pre-pandemic levels in terms of health care visits across the board. When you look at it for 12 and older versus 4 to 11, the 4 to 11 are actually even farther below baseline. And the reason for that is because recall that the vaccinations for the younger kids has been slower and haven't gotten to all of them yet. So parents are very cautious about getting their kids in and around the health care system and out and about when they have sickle cell disease and could potentially contract COVID. So that's why those health care visits are down. It has everything to do with COVID risk or our patients being at risk for poor outcomes if they catch it. So they're just being cautious. They're being smart and the kids are being especially, I guess, conservative. So that's still the case today. Although, as I also said in my prepared remarks, our market research suggests that physicians and patients are feeling more optimistic about getting back in person our reps are getting back in person at higher levels now. So we think this is all a good sign and a leading indicator that we're going to get there. Yes, that's exactly right, Ted. We've seen growth across the board, of course, substantial growth in the four to 11 given that it's new. But we do see growth also in the adults being reinitiated now as we've gotten this approval. There's it makes a lot of sense as well. Many of the physicians that are now treating the four to 11-year olds also have patients in the 12 and older. And as they \u2013 as we got approval, in a broader set of patients and the FDA wanting it to get to lower ages. That's also a great signal to our clinicians that this drug has even more experience, has been tested and proven in the marketplace now. The real-world evidence is stronger than it's ever been. So for all these reasons, there's more confidence using Oxbryta across the board. And in fact, in the 12- to 18-year-old group, we saw some reasonable growth as well, suggesting that yet, some of those same physicians that are now using it in four to 11 are now initiating it in their \u2013 in their 12 to 18 year olds as well. Yes, I can take that one. So yes, as we said in our prepared remarks, the NRx \u2013 we're not breaking it out by age group. We're looking at overall demand. We're super excited about having over 1,200 enrollments in the quarter, the highest we've had in over well, about two years and for a quarter, and that's really driven by both groups, the four to 11-year olds as well as the 12 and older. We saw growth in both those groups. In terms of dynamics in the kids versus adults. Yes, I mean, in general, pediatricians tend to be parents to be pretty cautious about what you put in the kid. So they're going to want to see and be convinced of a lot of the data. The good news is we got this indication after being on the market for two years. We have a wealth of real-world experience, safety data and experience in the real world. So we have a new formulation, for example, that was developed specifically for the kids that can be dissolved and into a liquid and given to the kids that way. And lots of great patient education and parent and caregiver education that goes with it. So we're set there. In terms of concerns, no new concerns. I mean if you think about it mechanistically, this is the exact place we should be going. The younger the population stopping sickling and preventing polymerization early should have the best impact on preventing downstream effects of sickle cell disease. So we're super excited about that, and we think the parents are as well. And then penetration-wise, we're very excited about being indicated across the board for all sickle cell patients ages four and older now. So we should be able to, over time be able to grow into more and more patients."

            "name": "Kim Smith Whitley",
            "content": "Thank you, DJ. And good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will provide an update on our efforts to further expand Oxbryta's clinical evidence and geographic reach, and our progress advancing our pipeline. Following on our regulatory approval in the European Union in February, we submitted for marketing authorization in Great Britain and believe we are on track potential approval by midyear. As a reminder in the UK Oxbryta was granted approval of early access medicines scheme EAMS, which provides two key advantages. First, patients that meet the eligibility criteria can gain early pre-licensed access to Oxbryta. We are pleased that UK patients have already started on Oxbryta through the EAMS designation. Second, medicines under EAMS that receive marketing authorization by the MHRA, as well as a positive assessment by NICE, benefit from accelerated NHS, England commissioning. In support of the pediatric launch this week at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology or ASPO Conference, we will present results from the Oxbryta expanded access program for children with sickle cell disease, age four to eleven.  The EAP data reinforces the efficacy and safety of treatment with Oxbryta in these patients, as seen in the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. Those hope HOPE-KIDS 1 results were first presented at EHA last year and were published this April in pediatric blood and cancer. Importantly, the majority of patients in the EAP had improved scores as measured by the patient and clinical global impressions of change scale, indicating that Oxbryta treatment is positively impacting their lives. I also want to flag that a 77-patient, single center, real-world experience study of Oxbryta from Dr. Alan Anderson was published in late April in the European Journal of Hematology. Dr. Anderson presented this data, which showed a mean hemoglobin increase of two grams per deciliter and substantial improvements in patient quality of life at several meetings in 2021. At the Annual EHA meeting in June, we plan to present new Oxbryta, real world data and other studies that reflect our efforts to generate new data. EHA abstracts will be announced later this month and we are excited about our planned activities. Now let's turn to the pipeline. For inclacumab, our P-selectin inhibitor, we are enrolling patients in our two Phase 3 studies collectively named THRIVE. One is evaluating the reduction of VOCs over a 48-week treatment period based on inclacumab's potential for quarterly dosing. We believe this would be a meaningful improvement for patients compared to monthly dosing and aligns well with a typical sickle cell disease practice schedule of quarterly office visits. The other Phase 3 study is evaluating 90-day VOC, readmission rates, following an initial VOC hospitalization, which tragically occurs in around 50% of patients who experience an initial VOC. This study is enabled by inclacumab's profile and aligned with its best-in-class potential. We are continuing to focus on enrolling THRIVE as quickly as possible. Turning to GBT-601, our next-generation hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor that we believe has potential to be a best-in-class therapy. At EHA, we aim to share more data on GBT-601, including sickle cell disease patient EPO levels from the Phase 1 study. Separately, we aim to publish new preclinical data for GBT-601 in a peer-reviewed journal later this year. Based on the impressive data we reported at ASH in December, we are working to aggressively advance GBT-601. Our plan is to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial with the goal of submitting for a full regulatory approval with FDA. We expect the Phase 2/3 design will allow us to advance more quickly into the pivotal Phase 3 portion and are working towards our goal of initiating the Phase 2 portion by mid-2022. The purpose of the Phase 2 portion is to identify the optimal dose to advance into Phase 3. As we explore higher doses, we believe they will lead to higher occupancy and hemoglobin increases, and importantly, consistently improve the red blood cell health of patients to resemble that of a sickle cell trait individual. We are also exploring a 150-milligram dose of GBT-601 with patients from our Phase 1 study. We are very excited that all six patients reach out to the clinical trial site wanting to restart therapy, providing us the opportunity to restart the study and explore a higher dose. In my experience, this is the first time I have seen the restart of a sickle cell study due to patient demand.  Patients will receive a 150-milligram daily maintenance dose for six weeks. We anticipate data from this portion of the study will be available by the end of the year and include the same key endpoints as the data we reported at ASH in December. I am proud of the progress we are making with GBT-601, over a short timeframe, while also continuing to drive enrollment in our inclacumab studies and advancing our Oxbryta studies. I firmly believe GBT has the leading clinical and pipeline programs in sickle cell disease. I'll now turn it back over to Ted. Hi, Ritu, it's Kim. Yes, we are going to be pursuing a loading dose similar to what we did with the Phase 1, MAD 1 and MAD 2 phases. And then we will be using a daily maintenance dose of 150 milligrams. So that's to clarify, Ritu, I'm sorry. That was for the follow-up for the Phase 1. We have not disclosed a dose for the Phase 2 because, as you know, we are using Phase 2 for the dose finding portion. So that's just what's going to be going on with the additional Phase 1 restart. So, we are going to explore, of course, the doses that we looked at, at least in our Phase 1 and consider doses based on a 100 milligram and 150 milligram before we decide whether or not we will explore doses above that. We are anticipating to restart the six participants, hopefully, all six, but we are not planning on adding new participants to the Phase 1 portion. We anticipate with the modeling that obviously this will be adjusted because our original modeling was based on six participants. But when you look at those six participants, we should, with a 150 milligram dose get occupancies above 40%. So we are comfortable using those going into a Phase 2, but understand that we'll get much more data to support a model to find a dose out of the Phase 2 study. We were really pleased to see that participants in the Phase 1 were interested in restarting 601. I think that what we're pleased with in the development of 601 is we have data from Oxbryta to go on. And as you know, in our HOPE trials, we had a global impression of health overall that shows that individuals felt better when they were receiving Oxbryta. So it's not inconsistent to think that individuals felt better and that was one of the reasons that they were interested in restarting. However, we did not query specifically why they were interested. But I think that just from knowing our Oxbryta experience, I would suggests that they may have felt better while on 601. Well, I think that one of the things that is very interesting about this approach is that using intrapatient or intra participant dose escalation is kind of standard within our drug development. So I don't think that this really required an additional discussion with FDA. I think that what we did was pretty conservative. We looked at two doses, then we looked at our safety tolerability profile and analyzed the data before we offered an increase in dose for the participants restarting. Yes. We're on target with our toxicology studies, there's no limitation for dose increasing based on that. And then the second part of your question was regarding... Yes. So there's no limitation on duration as well. And the \u2013 really the goal of the Phase 2/3 study will be, of course, with the Phase 2 to do dose finding and then to go over into a Phase 3 without having to start a new Phase 3 study. And there is really no limitation on the start of the Phase 2 other than the completion of the protocol, getting the sites on board and those study-related factors."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nFrancesca DeMartino: Good morning. And welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 via press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D; Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and the disclosures in our SEC filings which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties speak only as of the call's original date and we undertake no obligations to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, and of course, a compelling year we have ahead. I\u2019d like to begin with a few reflections on 2023. As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite however this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amidst the mixed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer. If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results for the first nine months of 2023, we were the number 1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with nine new molecular entity approvals on Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer. Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024. From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That can not only change patient lives but has changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint, spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and government relations. We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year is here are: First of all, to achieve world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I\u2019m confident that Pfizer is well positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders. Let's start with our first priority which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully extended the reach and medical impact of our U.S. commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least eight potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on. On the commercial side, the PADCEV launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and XTANDI launch in nonmetastic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of the PADCEV EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to Phase 3 Data readouts from Vepdegestrant in second line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and Braftovi in first line BRAF colorectal cancer. We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with Phase 3 starts of CDK4i in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early-stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first-in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases, and Inflammation and Immunology. In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry, and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. Starting first with our 4th-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation standalone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated superior relatively efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18-to-64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains. Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a Phase 2 COVID/Flu combination study for 18\u201364-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a Phase 3 COVID/Flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT-601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT-601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have Ponsegromab, our GDF15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with Phase 2 data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths significantly. Our third priority is of course to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution, to continue growing our top-line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years. To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than one billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment. With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With Elrexfio, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of Velsipity, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to Velsipity as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With Litfulo, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to Litfulo. In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave?\nDavid Denton : Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally right-sizing our cost base. With that said, I\u2019ll start this morning with our full-year and our fourth quarter results, then I\u2019ll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full-year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full-year and fourth quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14. On the bottom line, we reported full-year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the impact of the $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for Paxlovid and to a lesser extent Comirnaty. Now turning to the quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Contributing to this strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as Vyndaqel and Eliquis; partially offset by lower revenues for Ibrance and the Prevnar Family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom-line, continued to be significantly, and negatively, impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the results were significant decrease in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points driven primarily by the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix. Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10%, compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products. And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on re-prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses. Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion Paxlovid revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations. But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13 reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher sero-type coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend. Second is reinvesting in the business. And finally is making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, we have invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D and finally, we have invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, net of cash acquired, essentially all for the acquisition of Seagen. Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while de-levering our capital structure, with a gross leverage target of 3.25x and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to Tier 1 commercial paper. Upon achieving our de-levering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now given that we issued our full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance on December 13, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full-year '24 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8%-10%. We remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of the year. We believe right sizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing towards margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the full-year 2024 and as a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, and again with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our longer-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value. We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of the decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: So maybe I'm stupid on this question, but if I'm doing your math for your guidance of margins in low-70s for fiscal year '24. By my math, the margins for other biopharma would have to drop to about 60% in order to balance out the other margins. Can you just help me understand your guidance and triangulate that with your top-line and bottom-line guidance and triangulating that with your margin guidance?\nDavid Denton: This is Dave. Correct. Our guidance for gross margin, although we don't provide it specifically, we give us some color around the fact that it's approximately 70%. Obviously, our focus going forward is to improve our margin rate and more importantly, improve our operating margin rate to the bottom-line. As we look here at 2024, there's a few things that have compressed our margin rate. First is, as COVID has declined year-over-year, that has served to, I'll say, delever, if you will, the P&L as COVID takes up and cover some fixed overhead. But importantly, what's happening is we are in sourcing products that we've recently acquired. That in sourcing requires time before we get up to peak yield and performance so that in the short-term, dampens gross margin rate, but has a trajectory to improve gross margin rate over time. And then secondly, we have new launches that are coming online late in Q3 -- late in the second half of 2023 and moving into '24. Again, those are not at peak performance yet. That will ultimately improve gross margin rate as we cycle into later years. And then finally, I will say that over the last several years, we have absorbed some amount of inflation within our cost of goods sold. That is an area of opportunity for us as we think about improving performance longer term. So I hope that gives you some color.\nOperator: Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould : Maybe another kind of finance question here. Certainly, R&D in 4Q was meaningfully below kind of where you guys had set the guide there. How should we think about that? Does it just reflect sort of faster cost cutting? Is it just more an artifact of the later integration of SGen? And clearly, you're reaffirming your guide but just maybe if you can just sort of check that box for us, that would be helpful.\nDavid Denton: Sure. Probably not much to read into that. Obviously, R&D came in a little favorable than our expectations previously. Part of this is the fact that we are very focused on our -- realigning our cost base so consistent with the program. And then secondly, there probably is some timing that's dampening R&D in the fourth quarter that will slide into 2024 and into 2025. So there is some timing implications to that performance level. But I think importantly, back to my prepared remarks is our focus is on delivering net savings of $4 billion. And if you look through the end of 2023, about half of that we've achieved already. We're now focused on achieving the additional $2 billion or so as we cycle into 2024, and all eyes are on that objective.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Dave. We have high confidence on the number that we gave.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen : Sorry, I was muted. Wanted to ask you on your Prevnar franchise. First of all, for the fourth-generation PCV, could you give more color on how it compares in contrast with Prevnar 20? And then just on the Prevnar order timing issue, was that U.S. or ex U.S.?\nAlbert Bourla: Aamir, why don't you take the Prevnar question? And then maybe Alexandre, you can add a little bit color on the situation in the U.S. So what is the situation in Prevnar with the orders?\nAamir Malik: Yes. So Louise, with regards to Prevnar, with the pediatric business, we often see some lumpiness in quarterly revenues, given the timing and impact of CDC orders, so it's difficult to kind of map that all out quarter by quarter. So you should expect that on the pediatric business. But the pediatric business, otherwise, we're very happy with how our launch is progressing and the growth momentum that we see there. On the adult business, I think it's different in the sense that we have a 96% market share that we closed the adult business with at the end of the year. But it's really important to keep in mind that we are operating in a market where the patient pool is steadily decreasing. There was a big catch-up opportunity versus the prior recommendation, and we've worked through that catch-up opportunity already. So the remaining patients are generally those that are aging into the 65-plus population as well as those with underlying medical conditions, and those are harder to activate patients. So we expect that business to continue to face that smaller patient population going forward. And we also expect competition with V116 emerging that will make the adult market more competitive, but we see a lot of growth potential in the pediatric market.\nAlbert Bourla : Thank you. Alexandre, how was the Prevnar situation in the last quarter or in the year in international markets?\nAlexandre de Germay: Yes. Louise, good question. As you know, the majority of our ex-U.S. business is driven by tender. And of course, we book the sales when we ship the product. It doesn't reflect utilization. And then the government schedule their campaign in their respective markets. The reality is that we continue to have an IP exclusivity in 130 markets around the world. And at the same time, we continue to progress both on the pediatric, as you saw last week, the CHMP positive opinion, and now we're going to go into the final approval and then vaccine technical committees and pricing in all those markets, so that will take a bit of time. But at the same time, we see some positive traction on the adult franchise, where we have launched in over 30 markets. And we see some very good developments with the recommendation of the Vaccine Technical Committee. To give you an example, we used to have very limited access on our Prevnar 13 in country like Germany or France and UK. And we just received a recommendation from the VTC in Germany that actually recommended usage of Prevnar 20 in old adults over 60 as well as at-risk population from 18 to 59, which we believe we have a significant growth opportunity in increasing vaccination in the adult population ex-U.S.\nAlbert Bourla: And Mikael, to conclude what about the fourth-generation Prevnar?\nMikael Dolsten : Yes, I'm very pleased that the fourth generation has entered clinical studies. It has a Fast Track designation from U.S. FDA, indicating a unique product offering. And it includes some of the new technology we have developed that gives us a really cutting-edge tool box, whether it's chemistry carriers or reformulations. And of course, it relies on the unique Pfizer platform to have potential prevention of both invasive disease, which is the smaller disease burden and pneumococcal disease, which causes more than 150,000 hospitalizations. And to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that can address both of them. So we feel very good about that entry.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. So to summarize the Prevnar, which I know it is in the minds of all, let's start with the commercial front. In the U.S., clearly, the adult opportunity, we have taken the cream basically of the catch-up opportunity. This is happening once you are getting a recommendation from CDC for a catch-up. This market, the pool of patients has been largely exhausted. We have already 96% market share of that. So this is not a market, the adult now that we expect that will continuously grow in the U.S. Pediatric, very different story because our market share is now growing, and we have indications that we'll continue growing very strongly. So we expect in the U.S., the Prevnar situation to be a strong growth story in pediatrics. International, both, we expect to see growth because the products have just been launched, and then the recommendations are following. So there is a delay in international higher than usually there is in the U.S. So we expect to see growth in adult and pediatrics. I want to reemphasize that we have basically exclusivity of Prevnar 13 in more than 100 countries, 113 countries in of tenders. And we plan to convert that now to 20. And then on the fourth generation, we are moving full speed. We think that our expertise will allow us to build a polyvalent vaccine that will really compete very, very nicely as a fourth generation and will do that successfully and fast. So that's the story and let's move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Trung Huynh with UBS.\nTrung Huynh: Trung from UBS. Two, please. So in your prepared remarks, you noted you took a $1.4 billion impairment charge associated with etrasimod. Can you add more color here? What prompted that reevaluation? And any feedback of how that launch has gone? Secondly, on Abrysvo, so can you give us some color on how your contracting has evolved in '24 versus '23? And based on that, what's your market share do you think you can capture this year versus the 35% last year?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Why don't you take the impairment question and then I will move to commercial?\nDavid Denton: Yes. So on etrasimod, keep in mind that this product, we still anticipate to be over $1 billion in peak sales. As you know, there are multiple indications attributed to this medicine. And financially, as you look at that medication, there were additional indications that met the financial criteria for an impairment of which we took in the quarter. Clinically, obviously, clinically, there's still some work that will be ongoing in support of the asset. So with that...\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. So Aamir, maybe etrasimod commercially, how the launch is doing and the Abrysvo?\nAamir Malik: Sure. So I'll start with etrasimod or VELSIPITY as we call it. So just in terms of the product value proposition, we think this is a very promising oral option for moderate to severe UC patients. It's got strong efficacy that patients and physicians we've exposed this to. They want to start transitioning from conventional therapy to advanced therapy. And it gives them an option also to maintain once-a-day oral routine, which many are already on instead of beginning with an injection or infusion. So about 80% of those patients that haven't progressed to an advanced therapy prefer an oral option, but only about 10% of those patients actually get one. So there's a very clear need here that VELSIPITY can help us fit. And the benefit risk profile for VELSIPITY is also very, very strong. So we approved -- we received approval at the end of last year. And so we've invested efforts in building HCP and patient awareness on the label and on the value proposition. But I just want to remind you that with any immuno-inflammatory product, it takes time to get broad national access. And that is where our focus is right now is ensuring that we secure VELSIPITY access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option, and that's going to take some time to put in place. And when we have that in place, we see upside momentum from the launch.\nAlbert Bourla: What about Abrysvo?\nAamir Malik: On Abrysvo, I'll comment briefly on the adult and then on the maternal. On the adult vaccine, I think the market was clearly ahead of everyone's expectations and not limited by shared clinical decision-making versus a routine recommendation. We would like to do better than the 30-some percent share that you referred to as well. So we're very focused going forward on retail contracting for the '24, '25 season. But I will also mention that we are doing that with real thoughtfulness on ensuring that we secure a profitable share in those contracts and also differentiating using our maternal indication. We also see opportunities in the non-retail setting, where for example, with the system and with IDNs, we have strong share. And we're going to also focus on new opportunities that we're currently studying with Abrysvo, adults aged 18 and older with underlying medical conditions as well as a new packing presentation to better fit our customer needs. So we see momentum there. And on the maternal side, we're only a few months in, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing as the first maternal vaccine to prevent infants from birth to six months when they are the most vulnerable. More than 65% of women prefer to get the maternal vaccine versus having their infant immunized with a monoclonal antibody. And we think that the label provides us opportunity to grow that segment as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn : Two for me. I guess the first one is just Comirnaty rest of world was ahead of consensus expectations this quarter. Just wondering if there were any one-time benefits in that number, if that's a fair go-forward sales level to think about through 2026, given the existing EU contract? And then the second one is, I noticed that Danuglipron wasn't mentioned in the PR or the prepared remarks. Just wondering if that once-daily PK trial completed yet and what the next steps are there?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Maybe very quickly on Danuglipron, we didn't mention because we don't have anything to say more. So that's the only thing. There is a program, which is composed with a lot of experiments that we are doing now. In terms of moving it to once-a-day and we will speak only when we have data. We don't want to become now the focus again of another earnings call. But that being said, I'm moving it to Alexandre to discuss about Comirnaty in the rest of the world outside the U.S. What are the dynamics of Comirnaty?\nAlexandre de Germay: That's why there are several elements playing out on the Comirnaty franchise. First, what we see is restrictions on vaccination guidelines, right? So versus the previous years, we see that the guidelines are really focusing on the older population as well as the at-risk population. But we have, as you know, already signed several contracts with the European Commission, Canada, UK and Australia. And following the approval in August last year, we started to execute on our contract with the European countries. As a matter of fact, some countries have decided to advance some of their order in 2024 into 2023 so that they can execute their activation campaign properly. The other trend that we see is that actually, we don't see major vaccination uptakes in the future year. We think that what we have seen in 2023, 2024 campaign is really the type of acceleration we will see, and that will be carried on the next few years. The only area where there is a potential future growth in terms of vaccination uptake is, if we can increase our co-administration with the flu vaccines where in all our key markets, the rate of vaccination in flu is actually higher than it is for Comirnaty. So we believe that there is potentially here an opportunity. The last point that I want to say is, as you see that the Comirnaty self-pattern is evolving towards a seasonal pattern. So you saw you have a very strong Q4, like you expect in flu vaccination type of markets. And that\u2019s what we see also to be expected in 2024. And actually, as I was reading some of your models in the financial community, I think there is some confusion that we will have higher Q1, Q2, which I believe will be more towards the second part of the year, but of course, in line with the guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: I was looking at SEC filings from Cerevel and they disclosed that Pfizer was open to putting out a bid on Cerevel after Phase 3 data, which would have been in 2024. Meaning I also noticed that you were saying you're not open to a buyback in 2024 and deleveraging remains a top priority. So I just want to balance those two, especially also in the context of where the stock stands.\nAlbert Bourla: Look, I will ask Dave to speak about it. But the fact that we are looking everything and we are engaging in everything doesn't mean that, that's our obligation. We are doing all the work. It doesn't mean that our intention is to deviate the capital allocation strategy that we have just articulated. And that is the number one priority is our dividend and the growing dividend. Then it's a year of execution. We try to delever as David said. And then once we bring our deleverage to the levels that we are aspiring, we will start also moving into share buybacks and, of course, M&A, which means that for '24, we will see everything in existence because we never say never to business development opportunities could come. But our strategy, it is that you will not see anything major in business development in terms of dollars. David, did I say it well?\nDavid Denton: You said it well. You are correct.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. You are a good teacher. Thank you. And the other question, Umer? I think that was it, right?\nOperator: Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Maybe for Aamir. So Eliquis is the biggest drug on the initial list of 10 drugs for IRA. CMS has until February 1 to provide you the initial proposed negotiated price so that's two days away. So two questions here. Can you confirm you haven't already received that initial proposal yet? And second question, can we expect that at some point between now and September 1, which is the deadline that they have to make the final price public, that you'll give some investors some sort of directional information on how those discussions are going? Are we going to be kind of in the dark until September 1?\nAlbert Bourla: So Aamir, are you planning to give light to more? Give us.\nAamir Malik: So Tim, as you can appreciate, this whole price setting authority in Medicare, this is new and pharma companies obviously beginning to understand this process of the federal government. The rules are complicated, so we\u2019re wrapping our mind around it. Our alliance partner, BMS, is taking lead and engaging with CMS and an official process to determine the price for Eliquis in Part D that will begin in January 1, 2026. And also, as I\u2019m sure you can appreciate, we\u2019re not going to comment on an ongoing price-setting process and negotiation.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, it\u2019s very difficult to comment on these things because they are ongoing. So it\u2019s very inappropriate and absolutely could complicate things. I understand that there is a need for people to understand because that\u2019s an important product. And we will try as soon as possible and practical to be able to provide the level of details that we are looking at everybody is looking so that we can model it appropriately.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions, please. First to Aamir, under your new leadership and commercial focus, what key products would you guide us to of recent launches that we should look for in terms of acceleration of rollout trajectory? And it doesn't have to be recently launched, established ones as well. And then second to Mikael. Could you just share a little bit more information about your next-generation PCV vaccine, specifically how many serotypes? And I'm assuming that given it's a new technology, you will lose the ability to grandfather the pneumonia claim from the CAPiTA trial into the profile as it matures. If you could confirm, that would be great.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Andrew. Your assumption, I don't think it is correct, but Mikael will answer that. But let's first go to Aamir to basically give us a view how you see in '24 the priorities of the commercial execution in the U.S.\nAamir Malik: Yes. So Andrew, I'll take a step back and let me start by saying, I've been very excited about this role and this opportunity. And also to do it with the team that we've built, which is a mix of both seasoned Pfizer leaders as well as experienced leaders from outside of Pfizer. I mean, my focus and we can talk about specific products, we've touched on many of them already. But my focus overall is on execution excellence, right? So in our primary care and specialty care portfolio, we have a lot of great brands. We have some really enduring franchises, VYNDA, Eliquis, Prevnar. I spent quite a bit of time talking about that. Our focus there is to defend and grow where we can and we do see some opportunities. And we also have to acknowledge that we have some brands that have great value propositions, but they happen to be in highly competitive categories with some very, very well entrenched competitors. So in a situation like that, my focus is principally, let's really prioritize the actions that can grow each of the brands and we can talk about the individual launches. There's a lot of operational focus on blocking and tackling, including contracting. And then when we look at our main resources, we have our field force, our advertising and promotion dollars and our medical capabilities just prioritizing exactly where we put those. That is what I'm focused on with me and my management team. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities in some of the core franchises and defending and growing our share but then also in a number of our launches. And Albert mentioned in his opening remarks what we hope and expect to do with Abrysvo, with Nurtec, with Litfulo, with Sabinko. Those are all brands that we're going to continue to focus on, including some of our recent acquisitions like Oxbryta as well.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Aamir. Andrew, let me take the liberty to ask also the other commercial leaders to comment a little bit on their priorities because that will give you better sense of the whole picture. Alexandre, in international, as you are taking over, what are your key priorities?\nAlexandre de Germay: Thanks for the question, Albert, and the opportunity to share my priorities. My main focus is really to focus on the area where we can generate material growth with improved return on investment. This is my mantra. How are we going to do that? My top four markets in the order, China, Japan, Germany, and France represents 40% of our international divisions. So it's quite concentrated. Those four markets will report directly to me so that we can have the resources and support the country to execute on their plan at best and to generate the most growth. Our top 15 country represents 70% of our total international. So it's, again, quite concentrated. What I'm actually doing currently is in each of those markets, we are selecting drivers of growth. What are the key in-line and the key new products where we can have material impact with improved return investment? So I give you an example, of course, is going to be different from one country to the other because the archetype and the dynamic of those markets are different. So last week, I was in Japan. And so for instance, Vyndaqel, diagnosis rate is half the diagnosis rate that we have in the U.S. and in France. So we reviewed last week the plan to go and catch those increased diagnosis rate. And we're going to continue to, of course, track on execution. In Germany, Eliquis has a very strong Eliquis franchise. We believe we have got untapped opportunity. And I'm next week in Germany to actually review the plan on the Eliquis precisely. And we'll do the same thing on the new product. And it's going to be, for instance, LORBRENA in China. As you know, lung cancer in China is unfortunately affecting a large proportion of the population. And as a matter of fact, the proportion of the lung cancer that can benefit from LORBRENA in the worldwide community is about 1.7%. In China, it's actually 7%. So we believe we have a huge opportunity. What are we doing is actually developing a plan, last week when I was visiting China, to quickly get LORBRENA to those patients that could benefit from the clinical outcome. So this is really what I'm doing in each of our top 15 countries. Then frankly, the rest of the year will be simply tracking our execution, tracking all the metrics both from activities, medical activities and KPIs for each of our key products.\nAlbert Bourla: And then maybe, Chris, also on the commercial front? How do you think of the oncology in the U.S. evolving?\nChris Boshoff: Thank you, Andrew, Albert. Our biggest priority right now is obviously continuity of the business. We've done a lot of work during the last nine months during integration planning. And we don't want to miss a peak and it's now moving towards flawless execution with immediate priorities, obviously, the PADCEV launch for advanced/metastatic bladder cancer from the EV-302 study, the launch of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the EMBARK trial, the early launch, and also focus on access and awareness during 2024 for Abrysvo in late-line multiple myeloma. And for TALZENNA where up to 25% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer would be eligible in the U.S. for the -- from the indication.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. And then let's go to Mikael Dolsten, if you can make some comments on the next generation as much as you can share about sales.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. I think we have a very strong position with good momentum in the PCB conjugate. And I think Alexandre, you mentioned just the positive recommendation we got for PCB 20 in Europe. Now we're building on that unique platform. And as Andrew did say here, we are able, what you call, grandfather in unique claims for the higher segment for penumococcal pneumonia. It's really the major burden with 150,000 U.S. hospitalizations. And to the best of our knowledge, the Pfizer platform with a new fourth generation, as was with the third generation, will be the only one that can that claim based on, as you said, the original CAPiTA studies. Now the new generation will contain more serotypes, has applicability for adults and possibly pediatric as we have done with all of ours. And it also will include improvement on existing serotypes to, all together, get a very good increased coverage versus the PCV20. And I do think we are the one that really can continue this expansion of more serotypes, but you need communication chemistry to carry some reformulations. And I am cautious to abandon Neseritide where you work on infant and adults as the characterization what caused disease, for example, pneumonia is not very well described, so maintaining the coverage as we have uniquely and it's not really happening with the other product is a unique differentiation. So I feel very good about the fourth generation.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Albert, the oncology franchise following Seagen, I suspect, will probably be one of your bigger growth drivers for Pfizer going forward. The question is, is there an intermediate or long-term target as a percent of revenue that you're looking to achieve for this segment? And then are there technologies beyond ADC that you think could be additive to the pipeline?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Very general, then I will ask Chris to comment a little bit on the technologies that we are having here. I can't say how much oncology will contribute. But clearly, we have given expectations about Seagen, and we say that we expect it to be at $10 billion by year 2030 from $3.1 billion we gave guidance in 2024. And actually, we feel very good about the $10 billion. The more data coming, when we gave the $10 billion, we were not aware of some of the readouts that follow that projection. So we feel very, very good about that. Now, I have to say that the Pfizer pipeline in oncology, I think was also among the strongest in our therapeutic areas. So I think the combination, in general, is giving us, let's say, a lot of strength. But Chris, why don't you comment a little bit about how you see the R&D evolution of oncology, the platforms you are going to base your strategies?\nChris Boshoff: Thank you. So with the modalities we want to focus on for now are those where we see we have significant strength and capabilities, including with medicinal chemistry, our protein engineering as well as our strength in cancer biology. We therefore want to focus on small molecules, especially from our La Joya site, bispecifics, both La Joya and the new Seattle site and ADCs in Seattle. So small molecules, biologics. As you know, we do have an interest also in allogeneic CAR T cells with the formation of Allogene, the company we still follow and have a significant interest in. But we're now focused on those three modalities where we see significant opportunity also for combinations, for example, doing small molecules, ADCs, but also potentially in the future between ADCs and bispecific.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe a question on Nurtec, the trends in market share as well as pricing. Just wanted to make sure that is there a significant price delta between Nurtec price versus the competitor price, I mean, the discounts that they are offering, given that your competitor has multiple offerings in the headache market. And if there is a delta, do you expect this to grow or decline over 2024 on pricing?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mohit, very much. Aamir, about Nurtec and in general, the migraine franchise.\nAamir Malik: So Mohit, thanks for the question. So we were encouraged by Q4 for Nurtec, and I'll also include some comments on ZAVZPRET as part of my response. We were up more than 30% versus the prior year and 20% -- over 20% versus the prior quarter. And there's a few things that are encouraging. Nurtec continues to be the number one prescribed CGRP, so we have leading TRx volume and share. Interestingly, more than 90% of new prescribers in the category, many of whom are primary care physicians are prescribing Nurtec. And our pills per Rx has also, over the last several quarters, been steadily writing. So we continue to see opportunity. And there's a few things to keep in mind. One is, there's still a lot of unmet need. Albert referred to it in his written remarks. But there's a lot of patients undiagnosed. Very few get an Rx therapy. Oral CGRPs are still only less than 20% of the Rx market. But as you point out, this is also a very competitive category with Qulipta and Ubrelvy. And I won't comment specifically on their pricing strategies versus ours and GTMs play a role in all of it. But our focus for Nurtec, one, I think we want to be sharper and more competitive in our patient engagement and activation. Two, we have an opportunity with our field force to focus on both the most relevant CGRP writers, and as I said, PCPs. PCPs write two-thirds of triptans but only about a little over one-third of CGRP so there's an opportunity there. And then patient access and experience, there's an opportunity to really reduce the friction there. And I will also mention ZAVZPRET because with an intranasal, we think we can have a very nice complement to an oral for either rapid pain relief, and there's also an unmet need for patients that have nausea and vomiting from the use of an oral. So we want to continue to invest in growing our Nurtec and ZAVZPRET franchise.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Two questions. First, on Danuglipron, I know Pfizer doesn't want to provide an update. But clearly, the company has greater insight than we do into how the once-daily version is performing in the Phase I PK trial. So I'd like to ask how would you characterize that performance so far? In the absence of any visibility, it's kind of hard for us to be confident in the outlook for this program. Second question is a new weight loss agent was added to Phase I, designated 6016. Can you tell us what the mechanism is, please?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Steve, I'm going to disappoint you because you are asking things that we have said we are not willing to disclose at this stage for multiple reasons. Clearly, on Danu, we have more information than is very normal with everything that we are doing because we're having a very complicated, as I said, multiple experiments plan right now. But because we don't have new data, we're not going to comment on that. And on the new weight loss molecule also, we said that unfortunately, we are not going to disclose the mechanism of action. The reason is because, first of all, it's too early. We don't want to keep competition, nothing strange about that. So I'm sorry to disappoint you but there is not much to offer at this stage. Hopefully, as we said, mid-year is where we expect to have more information on that.\nOperator: Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\nDavid Risinger : Thanks for all the updates. So I have two questions, please. First is for Dave. Could you please discuss the '24 gross margin [indiscernible] some detail. I think on the last call, you had discussed potentially a low 70% gross margin. But if you can comment on that in more detail, that would be helpful. And the second question is for Mikael. If Danuglipron once-daily does have a profile that you're looking for, would the company then conduct a Phase 2A dose ranging study to assess the efficacy and tolerability in order to design a dose to advance Phase 2B or Phase 3?\nAlbert Bourla: Thanks, Dave. Very quickly, Mikael, resolve Danu and then we'll go to Dave.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, you heard Albert say that we are running a number of clinical experiments to garner insight in that molecule, and we have a second lift. Pfizer has always been open to consider different types of clinical study design. And in general, we tend to move into directly whenever data is supportive, if there is a large safety database into Phase 3 with a lead-in phase. But we have to look at each program by program. So when we have all the data, we will be able to share with you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Let's go to the gross margin where we can serve a little bit more information.\nDavid Denton: So David, this is Dave, and I'll be very brief here. Obviously, we've indicated our '24 gross margin expectations are in the low 70s as we discussed previously. As you know, as we cycle into '24, there's a few things that are happening, as I indicated earlier. One is, as COVID comes down, we're kind of deleveraging as COVID had absorbed a lot of fixed overhead. So that's compressing gross margins. Secondly, we're in the process of in-sourcing many of the acquired products over the last couple of years. And as we in-source, the short-term effect of that is dampening on gross margin, which gives us an opportunity to improve gross margins as yields improve over time. And then finally -- or two things finally here is new launches have that same characteristic, as we launch a new product, yields and performance in -- are not at peak performance. That will be an opportunity for us going forward. And then finally, we have absorbed some inflation over time that is an opportunity for us to take out over the next several periods. So again, an opportunity for us to enhance performance over time. But again, we're in this roughly low 70s for 2024 is our expectation.\nAlbert Bourla: And David, let me add a little bit more color here, but the Comirnaty and Paxlovid are big products, but they are manufactured in the same facilities, but they are separate facilities so they are not affecting the margins of the other products. So the margins were really absorbing in those facilities when you had such a huge volume production and value reduction, of course, the margins were seriously -- those products are seriously taking a lot of the overhead. Now, as we are reducing our expectations for COVID into very realistic within targets, this doesn't mean that we have eliminated our capacity to produce more if the demand is there because that would be not responsible, first of all, from a public health perspective but also from our investors' money perspective. So that's why so far, we maintain all this capacity although the revenues are down. So there's a significant. The second thing that David said, keep in mind, all basically our new acquisitions that brought so many new products, they were from smaller relative companies. They didn't really have their own manufacturing. So these were all outsourced and outsourced, of course, is way more expensive than when you are able to bring it. There are plans for everything, in-source, but in manufacturing, that takes three years, right, to be able to reduce the margin. And the last but not least, we have disproportional amount of new loans. And those new loans are coming with a very big cost when you build infrastructure or something new to be developed, but of course, you build it for your PIK revenues. But of course, you start with very low revenues and then those are going up. So as the infrastructure is there, but then higher revenue for these new products are coming, it\u2019s always the case with new products, but margins are expected. So it\u2019s not something about gross margins. You can see it in months. You see it in years the improvement. But clearly, this is an area that we know why it\u2019s happening what\u2019s happening and how we can improve it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: And maybe just for Dave and Albert, just kind of building on mid- to longer-term margin piece of the equation. It sounds like we should think about margin recovery as a gradual process versus a snapback? Is that fair? And I guess, the bigger picture question I was asking is just how do we think about reasonable longer-term margins, maybe not giving specific time lines, but can we think about kind of like mid- to high 30% operating margins as still a reasonable target for Pfizer? Or just kind of factoring in some of the dynamics we're seeing now, do we need to kind of rethink where margins can go over time?\nDavid Denton: No, I think you're absolutely correct. Mid- to high 30s is a reasonable target for us, with a slight caveat in the sense that the vaccine program, Comirnaty, has a shared, as you know, gross margin level with our partner. And so that\u2019s dampening to gross margins and operating profit. So I\u2019ll say, slightly mix adjusted for that product. And then from a progression standpoint, yes, you can think about this as a gradual steady improvement story over the next several periods.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.\nRajesh Kumar: Just on the medium-term margin profile. Thank you for the color you've provided. If you think about the growth aspirations you have, does that require you sacrificing some of the margins? So if you were to say, at the top end of your growth profile would we be looking at mid-30s gross margin or lower? Or what is the balance there? And the second one, you briefly touched on your capital allocation priorities earlier. Obviously, cost cutting and deleveraging is a priority for 2024. In the medium term, which are the therapy areas where you would deploy more capital after 2024 deleveraging exercise done?\nAlbert Bourla: David, why don't you take that?\nDavid Denton: Yes. So maybe on the margin discussion, obviously, what we've said is we have invested pretty substantially in our business over the past couple of years. So largely, the investment phase at least from a business development standpoint is behind us. We have work to invest to improve performance going forward, but the big dollars are already invested now. It's an execution story and a continued improvement story. So you should expect that to occur over the next several periods. Obviously, the higher the revenue, the better performance because you get to leverage your fixed costs. So clearly, the higher those revenue targets and achievements happen, the better improvement from a margin perspective you should expect from us. And then from a capital allocation perspective, I think you said it right. We are, at the moment, focused on executing our plan, focused on supporting our dividend growth over time, but importantly, beginning to delever as we cycle into an integration of assets. And then from a priority standpoint, clearly, we've made a significant investment in oncology. You should expect us to put the investment thesis behind that franchise going forward. Clearly, that's number one at this point.\nAlbert Bourla: And I would add that following the oncology, where clearly, we have right now the biggest part of our R&D expenses and we have a significant also part of our SI&A expenses. The other areas that we are putting a lot of emphasis when it comes to reserve, clearly, vaccines, it's vaccines and we plan to have significant productivity. In internal medicines, our metabolic franchise, it is an area that we are very excited. Obesity is part of that. We do believe that obesity is a big market and it's growing. And we do believe that Pfizer has the capabilities that allows us to play and win in that area. So that's an area that we will continue investing. Immune inflammation, we have significant investments is the other area. And of course, we have -- we are among the few that they have antiviral and on the effective still investments. So those are the areas that we will put money in, oncology, number one, then vaccines, metabolic diseases, immuno-inflammation antivirals are the ones that we are continuing to invest in.\nOperator: Next, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\nKerry Holford : Just a couple of pipeline questions for me, please. Firstly, on RSV. Can we expect you to announce the date for Abrysvo following that third season in Q2? And then also on the two Phase 3 starts, you've highlighted today B6A in lung and CDK4 in breast. When can we expect Phase 3 data readouts for these two products?\nAlbert Bourla: I'm not sure -- what was your question on RSV?\nKerry Holford : To understand when are you going to publish the data from the following the third season, third winter season of RSV?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Yes, I got it. Thank you. Why don't you take that, Mikael, on the Abrysvo? And then, Chris.\nMikael Dolsten: We continue to accumulate important RSV data and expansion of how the -- this important vaccine can be used. So you should expect this first half of the year, likely Q2, that we share more from our clinical trials, including full second season but also expansion in traditional age groups, as you can know, on clintrial.gov, we have active trials, and we think that will very nicely allow high-risk groups across a large age span to be addressed.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. And then, Chris?\nChris Boshoff: Thank you very much for the question. So the immediate readouts for this year, second half 2024 will be the [indiscernible] in second-line hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, the VERITAC-2 study, also second half 2024. We expect to anticipate results from BREAKWATER, very important indication, up to 12% of colorectal cancer with BRAFTOVI in first-line BRAF CRC. The new study starting right now is CDK4, B6A and dasitumab in Phase 3 programs and then also later this year for ECH2. Those will appear in clinicaltrials.gov and primary completion dates beyond 2025 and 2026, but obviously, there could be interim results with earlier results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Two questions, if I may. Aamir, with your prior role, you had talked about a $25 billion in revenues by 2030 that the company was looking to deliver based upon M&A. We have the impairment with Arena. Is there an update for that? And now that you're in the role of U.S. Chief Commercial Officer, non-oncology, non-COVID, what would be on your wish list in your currency in terms of where you feel an opportunity to expand those revenues potentially through business development that could work to hit that $25 billion target by 2030? Then secondly, with the M&A activity across the industry, investors are always paying attention to what's going on with the FTC. Having passed through this gauntlet with Seagen last year, is there anything you can comment about to help us think about how regulators are thinking about the M&A environment in terms of particularly size of deal or any other dimension that you think is worth being aware of that might have been your observations from your experience in '23?\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Aamir, why don't you take the question? By the way, let me clarify that Aamir's responsibility includes COVID revenue. So go ahead, Aamir.\nAamir Malik: Okay. So Chris, there's a lot in what you asked. Firstly, on the $25 billion goal that we put out there, I'll just remind that we guided to $20 billion for what we plan on getting to by 2030 for the deals that we had done. And I would also just remind you that the $25 billion was a 2030 goal, so there is lots of time between now and 2030 to achieve that goal, consistent with our capital allocation priorities that Dave described. On your second question, I mean, to be honest, yes, everyone's got a wish list, but my focus is on exactly what I described right now and what we talked about as a management team, which is delivering value from our launches and delivering value from the deals that we've done. So that's where my focus is. Now lastly, in terms of FTC, it\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment on what the FTC is going to do or not do. But what I can say is that we feel very good about how we have operated with all regulators in all regulatory sites across the world to get done all the deals that we did. And I think that just speaks to our patient-centric approach and our collaborative nature with regulator.\nOperator: Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\nAkash Tewari: Fair point on the Prevnar comments with the impairment charge and kind of the moving parts between adult pediatric and international. Consensus had modest top-line growth over the next few years for the entire franchise. Is that a reasonable expectation for investors, given the increased competition from Merck and the U.S. pool shrinking? And then do you have an internal view on what the ACIP recommendation will be regarding Prevnar and VV116?\nAlbert Bourla: Look, Aamir, why don\u2019t you take the -- is it the Prevnar expectations? We don\u2019t comment on what the expectations of the Street are, right? So are we -- and I think we gave a very good, let\u2019s say, high-level trajectory how we see this market. In the U.S., the adult opportunity, it is mainly as always in with the adult, a catch-up opportunity. So where you come, you have a pool of all the people that are eligible, but some of them would choose to make the vaccine. Usually, that happens in the first year and maybe a little bit then on the second year. We have exhausted, I think, this opportunity with a 96% market share. So right now, I don\u2019t think that we will see in the U.S. in the adult huge opportunity. Merck competition is coming into that. So this is not a very big growth area for us because, as I said, this is not where we plan to do it. It\u2019s huge when you launch them very quickly, goes down because then it is just the people that we are really graduate, they are going into this cohort in terms of age. The big opportunity is pediatric because it is four doses, it's not one. And because it is a huge cohort every year, way bigger the cohort of newborns than people that are becoming 65. So that\u2019s how we should see it. So there is nothing much to add into that.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: Two questions from me. One, when you think about the additional $25 billion revenues by 2030, now that Seagen's part of this business, where are we in getting to that metric? And then my second question is really on Oxbryta on sickle cell disease. When you bought the asset, you really -- you noted that you plan to speed up the distribution of the drug to parts of the world most impacted by the disease. We haven't really seen much OUS, given recent competitive approvals of in the Middle East. How do you think about the OUS opportunity in context of the competitive updates there? So Seagen and then thinking about some Oxbryta comments.\nAlbert Bourla: On Seagen, maybe I can take it because that's an easy answer. From Seagen, we expect to get $10 billion by year 2030. That was a number that we put out there when we announced the acquisition. Since then, a few things that have reinforced our confidence in this number have occurred. The first one, it is that ADC became the hottest thing on the M&A activity. Everybody wants an ADC, which basically our big bet was in this technology. So it looks like there is an overall consensus among investors, companies, analysts that this is a technology that will deliver a lot. So that gives us a lot of comfort that happened after we announced. The second thing that also happened after we announced this $10 billion was that Seagen came out with significant readouts or significant products that were beyond our expectations. But also what you don't see but we see, they are advancing a lot of stuff that some of them we will show you in the 29 of February. So also, it was a bet in the technology, a bet in the company, we feel that we did very well in both. So the $10 billion is $10 billion of the $25 billion but we remain -- we don't change it, but we remain confident that we can make it. Then of course, in addition to that, there was an additional $10 billion for all the other things that we have done, and this $5 billion that we could execute. Now on Oxbryta, how Oxbryta is doing, Aamir?\nAamir Malik: Yes. So Evan, with regards to Oxbryta and then I'll comment on the acquisition as well since you referred to that. We're pleased with the U.S. performance. Q4 was up 30% over the prior year and 14% over the prior quarter. The prescription trends are very solid. We've made a lot of investments in customer-facing teams since we made that acquisition. So we like the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S., and we expect to see more. Right now, the rest of the world is a very small part of Oxbryta revenue and that is something that will take time to develop and we'll obviously look at that appropriately. And as you think about the GBT acquisition, it's important to look at Oxbryta, but I also would remind you that we're also very excited about GBT601, which we expect can bring a lot of value in addition to Oxbryta. Some of it will -- if it's successful from a clinical and regulatory perspective, some sales will be cannibalized, but there will also be room for Oxbryta in the market to continue to grow. So when you look at the combination of the momentum in the U.S., an opportunity that's yet to be developed outside the U.S. and 601, where we presented great data at ASH in December, we think that there's a lot of value to be gained from this acquisition.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. And I would add, it is the same exactly with the GBT acquisition. When we did the acquisition, we announced our projections for year 2030. Since then, things have improved in terms of our confidence to deliver these numbers. And I'm not talking only that Oxbryta is performing exactly as we thought it would, but the most important upside is that we had data that we didn't have when we made the acquisition on the 601 but has the potential to become a transformative therapy in the sickle cell and really, really brings to the next step change if that thing -- if the Phase 3, let's say, reconfirms the Phase 2 results. So also over there, I think what we announced, we feel now we're more confident but we should be able to achieve and hopefully exceed. So with that, I think we start to end the call. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead. We have defined our five key priorities that will keep us focused. And I repeat again, this will be a year of execution. I have a sample, a team, that are handy that I believe are the absolutely right leaders to execute. And I know that the whole world was impressed with the way that we executed our COVID strategies, how we were able to execute on the R&D front, on the manufacturing front and on the commercial front with two products, the vaccine with the highest market share, and with the product in oral antiviral. We plan to repeat the same execution excellence level as we are building oncology leadership, as we are progressing the next wave of our pipeline, as we are maximizing the performance of all these new launches that have happened, as we execute our cost realignment program starting this year with SI&A, but also which you will see the results. But of course, the program to improve the gross margin that you won't see results now because it takes long but we started now as we speak, and laser focus in maximizing value for shareholders with the way that we allocate our capital. The team is there to make sure that this will happen, and I think we should meet again in three months, and we will see how we are progressing against those stated goals. Thank you very much, all. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Pfizer's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation, and you may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alexandre de Germay",
            "content": "Yes. Louise, good question. As you know, the majority of our ex-U.S. business is driven by tender. And of course, we book the sales when we ship the product. It doesn't reflect utilization. And then the government schedule their campaign in their respective markets. The reality is that we continue to have an IP exclusivity in 130 markets around the world. And at the same time, we continue to progress both on the pediatric, as you saw last week, the CHMP positive opinion, and now we're going to go into the final approval and then vaccine technical committees and pricing in all those markets, so that will take a bit of time. But at the same time, we see some positive traction on the adult franchise, where we have launched in over 30 markets. And we see some very good developments with the recommendation of the Vaccine Technical Committee. To give you an example, we used to have very limited access on our Prevnar 13 in country like Germany or France and UK. And we just received a recommendation from the VTC in Germany that actually recommended usage of Prevnar 20 in old adults over 60 as well as at-risk population from 18 to 59, which we believe we have a significant growth opportunity in increasing vaccination in the adult population ex-U.S. That's why there are several elements playing out on the Comirnaty franchise. First, what we see is restrictions on vaccination guidelines, right? So versus the previous years, we see that the guidelines are really focusing on the older population as well as the at-risk population. But we have, as you know, already signed several contracts with the European Commission, Canada, UK and Australia. And following the approval in August last year, we started to execute on our contract with the European countries. As a matter of fact, some countries have decided to advance some of their order in 2024 into 2023 so that they can execute their activation campaign properly. The other trend that we see is that actually, we don't see major vaccination uptakes in the future year. We think that what we have seen in 2023, 2024 campaign is really the type of acceleration we will see, and that will be carried on the next few years. The only area where there is a potential future growth in terms of vaccination uptake is, if we can increase our co-administration with the flu vaccines where in all our key markets, the rate of vaccination in flu is actually higher than it is for Comirnaty. So we believe that there is potentially here an opportunity. The last point that I want to say is, as you see that the Comirnaty self-pattern is evolving towards a seasonal pattern. So you saw you have a very strong Q4, like you expect in flu vaccination type of markets. And that's what we see also to be expected in 2024. And actually, as I was reading some of your models in the financial community, I think there is some confusion that we will have higher Q1, Q2, which I believe will be more towards the second part of the year, but of course, in line with the guidance. Thanks for the question, Albert, and the opportunity to share my priorities. My main focus is really to focus on the area where we can generate material growth with improved return on investment. This is my mantra. How are we going to do that? My top four markets in the order, China, Japan, Germany, and France represents 40% of our international divisions. So it's quite concentrated. Those four markets will report directly to me so that we can have the resources and support the country to execute on their plan at best and to generate the most growth. Our top 15 country represents 70% of our total international. So it's, again, quite concentrated. What I'm actually doing currently is in each of those markets, we are selecting drivers of growth. What are the key in-line and the key new products where we can have material impact with improved return investment? So I give you an example, of course, is going to be different from one country to the other because the archetype and the dynamic of those markets are different. So last week, I was in Japan. And so for instance, Vyndaqel, diagnosis rate is half the diagnosis rate that we have in the U.S. and in France. So we reviewed last week the plan to go and catch those increased diagnosis rate. And we're going to continue to, of course, track on execution. In Germany, Eliquis has a very strong Eliquis franchise. We believe we have got untapped opportunity. And I'm next week in Germany to actually review the plan on the Eliquis precisely. And we'll do the same thing on the new product. And it's going to be, for instance, LORBRENA in China. As you know, lung cancer in China is unfortunately affecting a large proportion of the population. And as a matter of fact, the proportion of the lung cancer that can benefit from LORBRENA in the worldwide community is about 1.7%. In China, it's actually 7%. So we believe we have a huge opportunity. What are we doing is actually developing a plan, last week when I was visiting China, to quickly get LORBRENA to those patients that could benefit from the clinical outcome. So this is really what I'm doing in each of our top 15 countries. Then frankly, the rest of the year will be simply tracking our execution, tracking all the metrics both from activities, medical activities and KPIs for each of our key products."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, and of course, a compelling year we have ahead. I'd like to begin with a few reflections on 2023. As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite however this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amidst the mixed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer. If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results for the first nine months of 2023, we were the number 1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with nine new molecular entity approvals on Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer. Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024. From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That can not only change patient lives but has changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint, spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and government relations. We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year is here are: First of all, to achieve world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I'm confident that Pfizer is well positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders. Let's start with our first priority which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully extended the reach and medical impact of our U.S. commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least eight potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on. On the commercial side, the PADCEV launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and XTANDI launch in nonmetastic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of the PADCEV EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to Phase 3 Data readouts from Vepdegestrant in second line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and Braftovi in first line BRAF colorectal cancer. We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with Phase 3 starts of CDK4i in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early-stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first-in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases, and Inflammation and Immunology. In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry, and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. Starting first with our 4th-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation standalone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated superior relatively efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18-to-64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains. Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a Phase 2 COVID/Flu combination study for 18\u201364-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a Phase 3 COVID/Flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT-601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT-601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have Ponsegromab, our GDF15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with Phase 2 data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths significantly. Our third priority is of course to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution, to continue growing our top-line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years. To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than one billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment. With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With Elrexfio, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of Velsipity, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to Velsipity as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With Litfulo, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to Litfulo. In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave? Thank you. With that, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. Thank you, Dave. We have high confidence on the number that we gave. Aamir, why don't you take the Prevnar question? And then maybe Alexandre, you can add a little bit color on the situation in the U.S. So what is the situation in Prevnar with the orders? Thank you. Alexandre, how was the Prevnar situation in the last quarter or in the year in international markets? And Mikael, to conclude what about the fourth-generation Prevnar? Thank you, Mikael. So to summarize the Prevnar, which I know it is in the minds of all, let's start with the commercial front. In the U.S., clearly, the adult opportunity, we have taken the cream basically of the catch-up opportunity. This is happening once you are getting a recommendation from CDC for a catch-up. This market, the pool of patients has been largely exhausted. We have already 96% market share of that. So this is not a market, the adult now that we expect that will continuously grow in the U.S. Pediatric, very different story because our market share is now growing, and we have indications that we'll continue growing very strongly. So we expect in the U.S., the Prevnar situation to be a strong growth story in pediatrics. International, both, we expect to see growth because the products have just been launched, and then the recommendations are following. So there is a delay in international higher than usually there is in the U.S. So we expect to see growth in adult and pediatrics. I want to reemphasize that we have basically exclusivity of Prevnar 13 in more than 100 countries, 113 countries in of tenders. And we plan to convert that now to 20. And then on the fourth generation, we are moving full speed. We think that our expertise will allow us to build a polyvalent vaccine that will really compete very, very nicely as a fourth generation and will do that successfully and fast. So that's the story and let's move to the next question, please. Thank you very much. Why don't you take the impairment question and then I will move to commercial? Thank you very much. So Aamir, maybe etrasimod commercially, how the launch is doing and the Abrysvo? What about Abrysvo? Thank you very much. Maybe very quickly on Danuglipron, we didn't mention because we don't have anything to say more. So that's the only thing. There is a program, which is composed with a lot of experiments that we are doing now. In terms of moving it to once-a-day and we will speak only when we have data. We don't want to become now the focus again of another earnings call. But that being said, I'm moving it to Alexandre to discuss about Comirnaty in the rest of the world outside the U.S. What are the dynamics of Comirnaty? Look, I will ask Dave to speak about it. But the fact that we are looking everything and we are engaging in everything doesn't mean that, that's our obligation. We are doing all the work. It doesn't mean that our intention is to deviate the capital allocation strategy that we have just articulated. And that is the number one priority is our dividend and the growing dividend. Then it's a year of execution. We try to delever as David said. And then once we bring our deleverage to the levels that we are aspiring, we will start also moving into share buybacks and, of course, M&A, which means that for '24, we will see everything in existence because we never say never to business development opportunities could come. But our strategy, it is that you will not see anything major in business development in terms of dollars. David, did I say it well? Thank you very much. You are a good teacher. Thank you. And the other question, Umer? I think that was it, right? So Aamir, are you planning to give light to more? Give us. Yes, it's very difficult to comment on these things because they are ongoing. So it's very inappropriate and absolutely could complicate things. I understand that there is a need for people to understand because that's an important product. And we will try as soon as possible and practical to be able to provide the level of details that we are looking at everybody is looking so that we can model it appropriately. Thank you very much, Andrew. Your assumption, I don't think it is correct, but Mikael will answer that. But let's first go to Aamir to basically give us a view how you see in '24 the priorities of the commercial execution in the U.S. Thank you, Aamir. Andrew, let me take the liberty to ask also the other commercial leaders to comment a little bit on their priorities because that will give you better sense of the whole picture. Alexandre, in international, as you are taking over, what are your key priorities? And then maybe, Chris, also on the commercial front? How do you think of the oncology in the U.S. evolving? Thank you, Chris. And then let's go to Mikael Dolsten, if you can make some comments on the next generation as much as you can share about sales. Thank you, Mikael. Yes. Very general, then I will ask Chris to comment a little bit on the technologies that we are having here. I can't say how much oncology will contribute. But clearly, we have given expectations about Seagen, and we say that we expect it to be at $10 billion by year 2030 from $3.1 billion we gave guidance in 2024. And actually, we feel very good about the $10 billion. The more data coming, when we gave the $10 billion, we were not aware of some of the readouts that follow that projection. So we feel very, very good about that. Now, I have to say that the Pfizer pipeline in oncology, I think was also among the strongest in our therapeutic areas. So I think the combination, in general, is giving us, let's say, a lot of strength. But Chris, why don't you comment a little bit about how you see the R&D evolution of oncology, the platforms you are going to base your strategies? Thank you, Mohit, very much. Aamir, about Nurtec and in general, the migraine franchise. Yes. Steve, I'm going to disappoint you because you are asking things that we have said we are not willing to disclose at this stage for multiple reasons. Clearly, on Danu, we have more information than is very normal with everything that we are doing because we're having a very complicated, as I said, multiple experiments plan right now. But because we don't have new data, we're not going to comment on that. And on the new weight loss molecule also, we said that unfortunately, we are not going to disclose the mechanism of action. The reason is because, first of all, it's too early. We don't want to keep competition, nothing strange about that. So I'm sorry to disappoint you but there is not much to offer at this stage. Hopefully, as we said, mid-year is where we expect to have more information on that. Thanks, Dave. Very quickly, Mikael, resolve Danu and then we'll go to Dave. Yes. Let's go to the gross margin where we can serve a little bit more information. And David, let me add a little bit more color here, but the Comirnaty and Paxlovid are big products, but they are manufactured in the same facilities, but they are separate facilities so they are not affecting the margins of the other products. So the margins were really absorbing in those facilities when you had such a huge volume production and value reduction, of course, the margins were seriously -- those products are seriously taking a lot of the overhead. Now, as we are reducing our expectations for COVID into very realistic within targets, this doesn't mean that we have eliminated our capacity to produce more if the demand is there because that would be not responsible, first of all, from a public health perspective but also from our investors' money perspective. So that's why so far, we maintain all this capacity although the revenues are down. So there's a significant. The second thing that David said, keep in mind, all basically our new acquisitions that brought so many new products, they were from smaller relative companies. They didn't really have their own manufacturing. So these were all outsourced and outsourced, of course, is way more expensive than when you are able to bring it. There are plans for everything, in-source, but in manufacturing, that takes three years, right, to be able to reduce the margin. And the last but not least, we have disproportional amount of new loans. And those new loans are coming with a very big cost when you build infrastructure or something new to be developed, but of course, you build it for your PIK revenues. But of course, you start with very low revenues and then those are going up. So as the infrastructure is there, but then higher revenue for these new products are coming, it's always the case with new products, but margins are expected. So it's not something about gross margins. You can see it in months. You see it in years the improvement. But clearly, this is an area that we know why it's happening what's happening and how we can improve it. David, why don't you take that? And I would add that following the oncology, where clearly, we have right now the biggest part of our R&D expenses and we have a significant also part of our SI&A expenses. The other areas that we are putting a lot of emphasis when it comes to reserve, clearly, vaccines, it's vaccines and we plan to have significant productivity. In internal medicines, our metabolic franchise, it is an area that we are very excited. Obesity is part of that. We do believe that obesity is a big market and it's growing. And we do believe that Pfizer has the capabilities that allows us to play and win in that area. So that's an area that we will continue investing. Immune inflammation, we have significant investments is the other area. And of course, we have -- we are among the few that they have antiviral and on the effective still investments. So those are the areas that we will put money in, oncology, number one, then vaccines, metabolic diseases, immuno-inflammation antivirals are the ones that we are continuing to invest in. I'm not sure -- what was your question on RSV? Yes. Yes, I got it. Thank you. Why don't you take that, Mikael, on the Abrysvo? And then, Chris. Thank you, Mikael. And then, Chris? Thank you very much. Aamir, why don't you take the question? By the way, let me clarify that Aamir's responsibility includes COVID revenue. So go ahead, Aamir. Look, Aamir, why don't you take the -- is it the Prevnar expectations? We don't comment on what the expectations of the Street are, right? So are we -- and I think we gave a very good, let's say, high-level trajectory how we see this market. In the U.S., the adult opportunity, it is mainly as always in with the adult, a catch-up opportunity. So where you come, you have a pool of all the people that are eligible, but some of them would choose to make the vaccine. Usually, that happens in the first year and maybe a little bit then on the second year. We have exhausted, I think, this opportunity with a 96% market share. So right now, I don't think that we will see in the U.S. in the adult huge opportunity. Merck competition is coming into that. So this is not a very big growth area for us because, as I said, this is not where we plan to do it. It's huge when you launch them very quickly, goes down because then it is just the people that we are really graduate, they are going into this cohort in terms of age. The big opportunity is pediatric because it is four doses, it's not one. And because it is a huge cohort every year, way bigger the cohort of newborns than people that are becoming 65. So that's how we should see it. So there is nothing much to add into that. On Seagen, maybe I can take it because that's an easy answer. From Seagen, we expect to get $10 billion by year 2030. That was a number that we put out there when we announced the acquisition. Since then, a few things that have reinforced our confidence in this number have occurred. The first one, it is that ADC became the hottest thing on the M&A activity. Everybody wants an ADC, which basically our big bet was in this technology. So it looks like there is an overall consensus among investors, companies, analysts that this is a technology that will deliver a lot. So that gives us a lot of comfort that happened after we announced. The second thing that also happened after we announced this $10 billion was that Seagen came out with significant readouts or significant products that were beyond our expectations. But also what you don't see but we see, they are advancing a lot of stuff that some of them we will show you in the 29 of February. So also, it was a bet in the technology, a bet in the company, we feel that we did very well in both. So the $10 billion is $10 billion of the $25 billion but we remain -- we don't change it, but we remain confident that we can make it. Then of course, in addition to that, there was an additional $10 billion for all the other things that we have done, and this $5 billion that we could execute. Now on Oxbryta, how Oxbryta is doing, Aamir? Yes. And I would add, it is the same exactly with the GBT acquisition. When we did the acquisition, we announced our projections for year 2030. Since then, things have improved in terms of our confidence to deliver these numbers. And I'm not talking only that Oxbryta is performing exactly as we thought it would, but the most important upside is that we had data that we didn't have when we made the acquisition on the 601 but has the potential to become a transformative therapy in the sickle cell and really, really brings to the next step change if that thing -- if the Phase 3, let's say, reconfirms the Phase 2 results. So also over there, I think what we announced, we feel now we're more confident but we should be able to achieve and hopefully exceed. So with that, I think we start to end the call. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead. We have defined our five key priorities that will keep us focused. And I repeat again, this will be a year of execution. I have a sample, a team, that are handy that I believe are the absolutely right leaders to execute. And I know that the whole world was impressed with the way that we executed our COVID strategies, how we were able to execute on the R&D front, on the manufacturing front and on the commercial front with two products, the vaccine with the highest market share, and with the product in oral antiviral. We plan to repeat the same execution excellence level as we are building oncology leadership, as we are progressing the next wave of our pipeline, as we are maximizing the performance of all these new launches that have happened, as we execute our cost realignment program starting this year with SI&A, but also which you will see the results. But of course, the program to improve the gross margin that you won't see results now because it takes long but we started now as we speak, and laser focus in maximizing value for shareholders with the way that we allocate our capital. The team is there to make sure that this will happen, and I think we should meet again in three months, and we will see how we are progressing against those stated goals. Thank you very much, all. Bye-bye."

            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally right-sizing our cost base. With that said, I'll start this morning with our full-year and our fourth quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full-year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full-year and fourth quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14. On the bottom line, we reported full-year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the impact of the $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for Paxlovid and to a lesser extent Comirnaty. Now turning to the quarter, I'd like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Contributing to this strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as Vyndaqel and Eliquis; partially offset by lower revenues for Ibrance and the Prevnar Family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom-line, continued to be significantly, and negatively, impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the results were significant decrease in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points driven primarily by the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix. Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10%, compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products. And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on re-prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses. Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion Paxlovid revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations. But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13 reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher sero-type coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend. Second is reinvesting in the business. And finally is making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, we have invested $10.7 billion in internal R&D and finally, we have invested approximately $44 billion in completed business development transactions, net of cash acquired, essentially all for the acquisition of Seagen. Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while de-levering our capital structure, with a gross leverage target of 3.25x and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to Tier 1 commercial paper. Upon achieving our de-levering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now given that we issued our full-year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance on December 13, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full-year '24 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8%-10%. We remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of the year. We believe right sizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing towards margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the full-year 2024 and as a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, and again with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our longer-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value. We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of the decade. And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session. This is Dave. Correct. Our guidance for gross margin, although we don't provide it specifically, we give us some color around the fact that it's approximately 70%. Obviously, our focus going forward is to improve our margin rate and more importantly, improve our operating margin rate to the bottom-line. As we look here at 2024, there's a few things that have compressed our margin rate. First is, as COVID has declined year-over-year, that has served to, I'll say, delever, if you will, the P&L as COVID takes up and cover some fixed overhead. But importantly, what's happening is we are in sourcing products that we've recently acquired. That in sourcing requires time before we get up to peak yield and performance so that in the short-term, dampens gross margin rate, but has a trajectory to improve gross margin rate over time. And then secondly, we have new launches that are coming online late in Q3 -- late in the second half of 2023 and moving into '24. Again, those are not at peak performance yet. That will ultimately improve gross margin rate as we cycle into later years. And then finally, I will say that over the last several years, we have absorbed some amount of inflation within our cost of goods sold. That is an area of opportunity for us as we think about improving performance longer term. So I hope that gives you some color. Sure. Probably not much to read into that. Obviously, R&D came in a little favorable than our expectations previously. Part of this is the fact that we are very focused on our -- realigning our cost base so consistent with the program. And then secondly, there probably is some timing that's dampening R&D in the fourth quarter that will slide into 2024 and into 2025. So there is some timing implications to that performance level. But I think importantly, back to my prepared remarks is our focus is on delivering net savings of $4 billion. And if you look through the end of 2023, about half of that we've achieved already. We're now focused on achieving the additional $2 billion or so as we cycle into 2024, and all eyes are on that objective. Yes. So on etrasimod, keep in mind that this product, we still anticipate to be over $1 billion in peak sales. As you know, there are multiple indications attributed to this medicine. And financially, as you look at that medication, there were additional indications that met the financial criteria for an impairment of which we took in the quarter. Clinically, obviously, clinically, there's still some work that will be ongoing in support of the asset. So with that... You said it well. You are correct. So David, this is Dave, and I'll be very brief here. Obviously, we've indicated our '24 gross margin expectations are in the low 70s as we discussed previously. As you know, as we cycle into '24, there's a few things that are happening, as I indicated earlier. One is, as COVID comes down, we're kind of deleveraging as COVID had absorbed a lot of fixed overhead. So that's compressing gross margins. Secondly, we're in the process of in-sourcing many of the acquired products over the last couple of years. And as we in-source, the short-term effect of that is dampening on gross margin, which gives us an opportunity to improve gross margins as yields improve over time. And then finally -- or two things finally here is new launches have that same characteristic, as we launch a new product, yields and performance in -- are not at peak performance. That will be an opportunity for us going forward. And then finally, we have absorbed some inflation over time that is an opportunity for us to take out over the next several periods. So again, an opportunity for us to enhance performance over time. But again, we're in this roughly low 70s for 2024 is our expectation. No, I think you're absolutely correct. Mid- to high 30s is a reasonable target for us, with a slight caveat in the sense that the vaccine program, Comirnaty, has a shared, as you know, gross margin level with our partner. And so that's dampening to gross margins and operating profit. So I'll say, slightly mix adjusted for that product. And then from a progression standpoint, yes, you can think about this as a gradual steady improvement story over the next several periods. Yes. So maybe on the margin discussion, obviously, what we've said is we have invested pretty substantially in our business over the past couple of years. So largely, the investment phase at least from a business development standpoint is behind us. We have work to invest to improve performance going forward, but the big dollars are already invested now. It's an execution story and a continued improvement story. So you should expect that to occur over the next several periods. Obviously, the higher the revenue, the better performance because you get to leverage your fixed costs. So clearly, the higher those revenue targets and achievements happen, the better improvement from a margin perspective you should expect from us. And then from a capital allocation perspective, I think you said it right. We are, at the moment, focused on executing our plan, focused on supporting our dividend growth over time, but importantly, beginning to delever as we cycle into an integration of assets. And then from a priority standpoint, clearly, we've made a significant investment in oncology. You should expect us to put the investment thesis behind that franchise going forward. Clearly, that's number one at this point."

            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Yes, I'm very pleased that the fourth generation has entered clinical studies. It has a Fast Track designation from U.S. FDA, indicating a unique product offering. And it includes some of the new technology we have developed that gives us a really cutting-edge tool box, whether it's chemistry carriers or reformulations. And of course, it relies on the unique Pfizer platform to have potential prevention of both invasive disease, which is the smaller disease burden and pneumococcal disease, which causes more than 150,000 hospitalizations. And to the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that can address both of them. So we feel very good about that entry. Yes. I think we have a very strong position with good momentum in the PCB conjugate. And I think Alexandre, you mentioned just the positive recommendation we got for PCB 20 in Europe. Now we're building on that unique platform. And as Andrew did say here, we are able, what you call, grandfather in unique claims for the higher segment for penumococcal pneumonia. It's really the major burden with 150,000 U.S. hospitalizations. And to the best of our knowledge, the Pfizer platform with a new fourth generation, as was with the third generation, will be the only one that can that claim based on, as you said, the original CAPiTA studies. Now the new generation will contain more serotypes, has applicability for adults and possibly pediatric as we have done with all of ours. And it also will include improvement on existing serotypes to, all together, get a very good increased coverage versus the PCV20. And I do think we are the one that really can continue this expansion of more serotypes, but you need communication chemistry to carry some reformulations. And I am cautious to abandon Neseritide where you work on infant and adults as the characterization what caused disease, for example, pneumonia is not very well described, so maintaining the coverage as we have uniquely and it's not really happening with the other product is a unique differentiation. So I feel very good about the fourth generation. Yes, you heard Albert say that we are running a number of clinical experiments to garner insight in that molecule, and we have a second lift. Pfizer has always been open to consider different types of clinical study design. And in general, we tend to move into directly whenever data is supportive, if there is a large safety database into Phase 3 with a lead-in phase. But we have to look at each program by program. So when we have all the data, we will be able to share with you. We continue to accumulate important RSV data and expansion of how the -- this important vaccine can be used. So you should expect this first half of the year, likely Q2, that we share more from our clinical trials, including full second season but also expansion in traditional age groups, as you can know, on clintrial.gov, we have active trials, and we think that will very nicely allow high-risk groups across a large age span to be addressed."

            "name": "Chris Boshoff",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, Albert. Our biggest priority right now is obviously continuity of the business. We've done a lot of work during the last nine months during integration planning. And we don't want to miss a peak and it's now moving towards flawless execution with immediate priorities, obviously, the PADCEV launch for advanced/metastatic bladder cancer from the EV-302 study, the launch of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the EMBARK trial, the early launch, and also focus on access and awareness during 2024 for Abrysvo in late-line multiple myeloma. And for TALZENNA where up to 25% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer would be eligible in the U.S. for the -- from the indication. Thank you. So with the modalities we want to focus on for now are those where we see we have significant strength and capabilities, including with medicinal chemistry, our protein engineering as well as our strength in cancer biology. We therefore want to focus on small molecules, especially from our La Joya site, bispecifics, both La Joya and the new Seattle site and ADCs in Seattle. So small molecules, biologics. As you know, we do have an interest also in allogeneic CAR T cells with the formation of Allogene, the company we still follow and have a significant interest in. But we're now focused on those three modalities where we see significant opportunity also for combinations, for example, doing small molecules, ADCs, but also potentially in the future between ADCs and bispecific. Thank you very much for the question. So the immediate readouts for this year, second half 2024 will be the [indiscernible] in second-line hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, the VERITAC-2 study, also second half 2024. We expect to anticipate results from BREAKWATER, very important indication, up to 12% of colorectal cancer with BRAFTOVI in first-line BRAF CRC. The new study starting right now is CDK4, B6A and dasitumab in Phase 3 programs and then also later this year for ECH2. Those will appear in clinicaltrials.gov and primary completion dates beyond 2025 and 2026, but obviously, there could be interim results with earlier results."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Aamir Malik",
            "content": "Yes. So Louise, with regards to Prevnar, with the pediatric business, we often see some lumpiness in quarterly revenues, given the timing and impact of CDC orders, so it's difficult to kind of map that all out quarter by quarter. So you should expect that on the pediatric business. But the pediatric business, otherwise, we're very happy with how our launch is progressing and the growth momentum that we see there. On the adult business, I think it's different in the sense that we have a 96% market share that we closed the adult business with at the end of the year. But it's really important to keep in mind that we are operating in a market where the patient pool is steadily decreasing. There was a big catch-up opportunity versus the prior recommendation, and we've worked through that catch-up opportunity already. So the remaining patients are generally those that are aging into the 65-plus population as well as those with underlying medical conditions, and those are harder to activate patients. So we expect that business to continue to face that smaller patient population going forward. And we also expect competition with V116 emerging that will make the adult market more competitive, but we see a lot of growth potential in the pediatric market. Sure. So I'll start with etrasimod or VELSIPITY as we call it. So just in terms of the product value proposition, we think this is a very promising oral option for moderate to severe UC patients. It's got strong efficacy that patients and physicians we've exposed this to. They want to start transitioning from conventional therapy to advanced therapy. And it gives them an option also to maintain once-a-day oral routine, which many are already on instead of beginning with an injection or infusion. So about 80% of those patients that haven't progressed to an advanced therapy prefer an oral option, but only about 10% of those patients actually get one. So there's a very clear need here that VELSIPITY can help us fit. And the benefit risk profile for VELSIPITY is also very, very strong. So we approved -- we received approval at the end of last year. And so we've invested efforts in building HCP and patient awareness on the label and on the value proposition. But I just want to remind you that with any immuno-inflammatory product, it takes time to get broad national access. And that is where our focus is right now is ensuring that we secure VELSIPITY access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option, and that's going to take some time to put in place. And when we have that in place, we see upside momentum from the launch. On Abrysvo, I'll comment briefly on the adult and then on the maternal. On the adult vaccine, I think the market was clearly ahead of everyone's expectations and not limited by shared clinical decision-making versus a routine recommendation. We would like to do better than the 30-some percent share that you referred to as well. So we're very focused going forward on retail contracting for the '24, '25 season. But I will also mention that we are doing that with real thoughtfulness on ensuring that we secure a profitable share in those contracts and also differentiating using our maternal indication. We also see opportunities in the non-retail setting, where for example, with the system and with IDNs, we have strong share. And we're going to also focus on new opportunities that we're currently studying with Abrysvo, adults aged 18 and older with underlying medical conditions as well as a new packing presentation to better fit our customer needs. So we see momentum there. And on the maternal side, we're only a few months in, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing as the first maternal vaccine to prevent infants from birth to six months when they are the most vulnerable. More than 65% of women prefer to get the maternal vaccine versus having their infant immunized with a monoclonal antibody. And we think that the label provides us opportunity to grow that segment as well. So Tim, as you can appreciate, this whole price setting authority in Medicare, this is new and pharma companies obviously beginning to understand this process of the federal government. The rules are complicated, so we're wrapping our mind around it. Our alliance partner, BMS, is taking lead and engaging with CMS and an official process to determine the price for Eliquis in Part D that will begin in January 1, 2026. And also, as I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not going to comment on an ongoing price-setting process and negotiation. Yes. So Andrew, I'll take a step back and let me start by saying, I've been very excited about this role and this opportunity. And also to do it with the team that we've built, which is a mix of both seasoned Pfizer leaders as well as experienced leaders from outside of Pfizer. I mean, my focus and we can talk about specific products, we've touched on many of them already. But my focus overall is on execution excellence, right? So in our primary care and specialty care portfolio, we have a lot of great brands. We have some really enduring franchises, VYNDA, Eliquis, Prevnar. I spent quite a bit of time talking about that. Our focus there is to defend and grow where we can and we do see some opportunities. And we also have to acknowledge that we have some brands that have great value propositions, but they happen to be in highly competitive categories with some very, very well entrenched competitors. So in a situation like that, my focus is principally, let's really prioritize the actions that can grow each of the brands and we can talk about the individual launches. There's a lot of operational focus on blocking and tackling, including contracting. And then when we look at our main resources, we have our field force, our advertising and promotion dollars and our medical capabilities just prioritizing exactly where we put those. That is what I'm focused on with me and my management team. And as I mentioned, we see opportunities in some of the core franchises and defending and growing our share but then also in a number of our launches. And Albert mentioned in his opening remarks what we hope and expect to do with Abrysvo, with Nurtec, with Litfulo, with Sabinko. Those are all brands that we're going to continue to focus on, including some of our recent acquisitions like Oxbryta as well. So Mohit, thanks for the question. So we were encouraged by Q4 for Nurtec, and I'll also include some comments on ZAVZPRET as part of my response. We were up more than 30% versus the prior year and 20% -- over 20% versus the prior quarter. And there's a few things that are encouraging. Nurtec continues to be the number one prescribed CGRP, so we have leading TRx volume and share. Interestingly, more than 90% of new prescribers in the category, many of whom are primary care physicians are prescribing Nurtec. And our pills per Rx has also, over the last several quarters, been steadily writing. So we continue to see opportunity. And there's a few things to keep in mind. One is, there's still a lot of unmet need. Albert referred to it in his written remarks. But there's a lot of patients undiagnosed. Very few get an Rx therapy. Oral CGRPs are still only less than 20% of the Rx market. But as you point out, this is also a very competitive category with Qulipta and Ubrelvy. And I won't comment specifically on their pricing strategies versus ours and GTMs play a role in all of it. But our focus for Nurtec, one, I think we want to be sharper and more competitive in our patient engagement and activation. Two, we have an opportunity with our field force to focus on both the most relevant CGRP writers, and as I said, PCPs. PCPs write two-thirds of triptans but only about a little over one-third of CGRP so there's an opportunity there. And then patient access and experience, there's an opportunity to really reduce the friction there. And I will also mention ZAVZPRET because with an intranasal, we think we can have a very nice complement to an oral for either rapid pain relief, and there's also an unmet need for patients that have nausea and vomiting from the use of an oral. So we want to continue to invest in growing our Nurtec and ZAVZPRET franchise. Okay. So Chris, there's a lot in what you asked. Firstly, on the $25 billion goal that we put out there, I'll just remind that we guided to $20 billion for what we plan on getting to by 2030 for the deals that we had done. And I would also just remind you that the $25 billion was a 2030 goal, so there is lots of time between now and 2030 to achieve that goal, consistent with our capital allocation priorities that Dave described. On your second question, I mean, to be honest, yes, everyone's got a wish list, but my focus is on exactly what I described right now and what we talked about as a management team, which is delivering value from our launches and delivering value from the deals that we've done. So that's where my focus is. Now lastly, in terms of FTC, it's not appropriate for us to comment on what the FTC is going to do or not do. But what I can say is that we feel very good about how we have operated with all regulators in all regulatory sites across the world to get done all the deals that we did. And I think that just speaks to our patient-centric approach and our collaborative nature with regulator. Yes. So Evan, with regards to Oxbryta and then I'll comment on the acquisition as well since you referred to that. We're pleased with the U.S. performance. Q4 was up 30% over the prior year and 14% over the prior quarter. The prescription trends are very solid. We've made a lot of investments in customer-facing teams since we made that acquisition. So we like the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S., and we expect to see more. Right now, the rest of the world is a very small part of Oxbryta revenue and that is something that will take time to develop and we'll obviously look at that appropriately. And as you think about the GBT acquisition, it's important to look at Oxbryta, but I also would remind you that we're also very excited about GBT601, which we expect can bring a lot of value in addition to Oxbryta. Some of it will -- if it's successful from a clinical and regulatory perspective, some sales will be cannibalized, but there will also be room for Oxbryta in the market to continue to grow. So when you look at the combination of the momentum in the U.S., an opportunity that's yet to be developed outside the U.S. and 601, where we presented great data at ASH in December, we think that there's a lot of value to be gained from this acquisition."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nFrancesca DeMartino: Good morning. And welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com.  Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of 2023. Our earnings materials can be accessed on the IR website at investors.pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Research & Development. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. Chris Boshoff, our Chief Oncology Research & Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. I encourage you to read the disclaimer on slide 3. Additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on earnings release and in our SEC Forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Francesca. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.  Pfizer continues to have a far-reaching and positive impact on human health. Through the first nine months of the year, more than 457 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. Compared with the first nine months of 2022, we have reached more patients in several key therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiovascular disease and anti-infectives.  Patients will always be our North Star, and these figures serve as a testament to our leadership in innovation and our commitment to understanding and serving patients' needs.  During the third quarter, we were encouraged by the continued strong performance of Pfizer's non-COVID products, with revenue from these products growing 10% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. We saw significant contributions from new launches and robust year-over-year growth for several key in-line brands.  Our recently launched respiratory syncytial virus, the RSV, vaccine \u2013 it's called ABRYSVO \u2013 contributed $375 million in US revenues. With the recent approval of the maternal indication, Pfizer is the only company with an RSV vaccine approved for preventing RSV in older adults and in infants via maternal immunization. We believe ABRYSVO will be a significant and growing contributor to revenue as many customers have indicated to us that protecting both populations with one vaccine is desirable and a competitive advantage for ABRYSVO.  In the US alone, there are approximately 80 million adults over age 60 who are eligible for RSV vaccination, and an estimated 1.5 million pregnant women are eligible for maternal immunization with our RSV vaccine between September 2023 and January 2024.  Nurtec, Vydura and Oxbryta, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022, contributed $233 million and $85 million in global revenues, respectively. For Nurtec, in the US, oral CGRPs represent about 17% of the migraine market, and the unmet need is high. We believe oral CGRPs can ultimately be the first-line therapy for migraine and could eventually account for as much as 40% of the overall migraine market.  Primary care is a clear source of potential growth in the migraine marketplace. Year to date, primary care healthcare providers wrote more than 6.1 million prescriptions for Triptans compared with approximately 1 million for oral CGRPs, which highlights a significant potential opportunity for growth.  Regarding Oxbryta, there is significant burden of illness and unmet need for patients suffering from sickle cell disease. An estimated 12 million people around the world have SCD, sickle cell disease, with the highest prevalence in countries with the lowest resources. While in the US, 95% of children survive to adulthood, 99% of children in other regions will die before they reach their 5th birthday, many without ever being diagnosed. Our Vyndaqel family of products, including Vyndaqel, Vyndamax and Vynmac, recorded 47% operational growth globally compared with the third quarter of 2022. This growth was driven largely by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, primarily in the US and developed Europe. We estimate there are between 120,000 and 150,000 people suffering from ATTR cardiomyopathy, with the majority still not yet diagnosed.  The largest unmet need continues to be the lack of general understanding and ability to diagnose this deadly disease, which is why we are focused on educational activities to expedite diagnosis and get appropriate patients on to treatment with the product as the proven standard of care. Such efforts significantly contributed to this quarter's revenue increase in the US. And our Prevnar family of products, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, saw global revenue rise 15% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by strong patient demand for Prevnar 20 Adult in the US, the US approval of Prevnar 20 Pediatric and associated stocking, and growth of Prevenar 13 Pediatric in certain emerging markets. These were partially offset by anticipated lower market share in the US for Prevnar Pediatric due to competitive entry. Of note, Prevnar 20 Adult remains the category-leading pneumococcal vaccine for adults in the US with a 95% market share in the third quarter.  Year-to-date, revenues for our non-COVID products have grown 7% operationally, and we remain on track to deliver 6% to 8% operational revenue growth for these products for the full year.  We continue to progress toward our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. Recent milestones include US and EU approvals and launch of ABRYSVO in pregnant individuals; US approval and launch of Elrexfio in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; US approval of our Braftovi+Mektovi combination in BRAF-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; US approval of VELSIPITY for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis; EC approval of Litfulo for severe alopecia areata; and US approval of PENBRAYA, the first and only pentavalent vaccine that provides coverage against the five most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 years of age.  To date, we have now executed 13 of the 19 originally identified potential launches, with four other products approved and preparations being made for their launch. In fact, five of the six remaining potential launches have been largely de-risked from a technical perspective. The only one remaining would be our mRNA flu candidate.  Given our recent positive results from our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate and pending results for our 65-and-older first-generation Phase 3 standalone mRNA flu study, timing for our standalone mRNA flu is now expected after 2024. If successful, our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate is expected to market in 2025. Mikael will share more about these programs shortly.  We remain excited about our proposed acquisition of Seagen and the dramatic impact we think this combination can have on human health. One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. So, conquering cancer would have an almost unimaginable impact on humanity.  We recently gained unconditional antitrust clearance from the EC, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance by the US FTC.  We have raised $31 billion in acquisition financing so far and continue to expect incremental 2030 risk-adjusted revenues in excess of $10 billion and expected cost efficiencies of $1 billion to be realized by the end of year three post-closing without impacting any R&D programs.  With that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. So Dave?\nDave Denton : Thank you, Albert. And good morning. Before I review this quarter's results, I will address a couple of topics that have been top of mind with investors since our announcement on October 13th. These topics relate to our future US government Paxlovid revenue forecasts, as well as our multi-year cost realignment program.  With respect to revenue recognition associated with the amended agreement, the US government is expected to return an estimated 7.9 million EUA-labeled treatment courses and, in return, will receive a volume-based credit at an approximate value of $4.2 billion at the end of 2023 for future treatment courses. Pfizer will also provide an additional 1 million treatment courses into the US strategic national stockpile.  As a result of all that, Pfizer has an obligation to deliver an estimated 8.9 million treatment courses for which we will record approximately $4.2 billion of revenue beginning in 2024 as we deliver treatment courses. It is important to note that there is no cash compensation for the estimated 8.9 million treatment courses delivered.  Regarding our cost realignment program, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve at least $3.5 billion of net cost savings by the end of 2024 versus the mid-point of our August 1, 2023 SI&A and R&D guidance. We expect $1 billion of targeted savings in 2023 and expect an additional savings of at least $2.5 billion in 2024. In a moment, when I review the components of our full-year 2023 guidance, you will see that we have lowered the midpoints of both our SI&A and R&D guidance ranges by $500 million, respectively.  Now, turning to the quarter, our Q3 results, both top and bottom line, were significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products. Revenues declined 41% operationally, the result of the decrease in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales, while adjusted diluted loss per share was also significantly impacted by $5.6 billion of non-cash inventory write-offs of COVID related inventories.  I want to emphasize, as Albert stated previously, that the operational revenue growth of our products in Q3, excluding both Paxlovid and Comirnaty were strong at 10%. Contributing to this strong performance was our newly approved RSV vaccine and the families of products associated with both Prevnar and Vyndaqel. Additionally, our recently acquired products, Nurtec and Oxbryta, also contributed to this strong growth.  Our reported diluted loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.17 in the quarter are primarily the result of the decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales and the non-cash charge related to write-offs of COVID-related inventories. The inventory write-off of $4.7 billion for Paxlovid and $900 million for Comirnaty negatively affected adjusted loss per share by $0.84.  Foreign exchange movements had a de minimis unfavorable impact on third quarter revenues and increased adjusted diluted loss per share by $0.04 or 2% compared to LY.  Now, let me briefly touch on our full-year guidance. Given we updated our full-year revenue and EPS guidance on October 13th, I am just going to hit a few of the highlights. Total company full-year 2023 revenues are expected to be in the range of $58 billion to $61 billion versus previous range of $67 billion to $70 billion. Importantly, we continue to expect 6% to 8% full- year operational revenue growth for non-COVID products year-over-year. As anticipated, the majority of this growth is occurring in the second half of the year, given the timing of new product and indicated launches.  I want to remind you that, beginning in Q4, we will overlap the acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT last year, which we completed on October of 2022.  Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43%, primarily the result of the $5.6 billion non-cash charge related to inventory write-offs for our COVID products.  Adjusted SI&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be within a range of $11.9 billion to $12.9 billion. The mid-points of both ranges are now $500 million lower than our original guidance.  As a result of all these, the company now expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 versus the original guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45. All additional components of our guidance are included in our press release that was issued earlier today.  As discussed in prior quarters, our capital strategy is based on three core pillars. First is reinvesting in our business. Second is growing our dividends over time. And third is making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested $7.9 billion in internal R&D, returned $6.9 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed Seagen acquisition.  Lastly, in addition to our completing a $31 billion unsecured debt offering in Q2 of this year, we are ready to execute the remaining short-term financing to complete the proposed Seagen acquisition upon fulfillment of the required closing conditions. We expect to de-lever our capital structure following the completion of this transaction, and as we de-lever, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases.  In closing, I want to reiterate that our product portfolio remains very strong. We continue to be encouraged by the momentum of our non-COVID products in Q3 and are committed to the successful execution of our new product and indication launches. We expect that the cost realignment program will improve our operating margins, enhancing long-term shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it over to Mikael. \nMikael Dolsten : Thank you, Dave. Today, I will share important updates from our robust respiratory vaccine portfolio.  Our respiratory vaccines are built upon three cutting-edge platforms that enable us to bring the right science to the right pathogen. These include our mRNA platform in partnership with BioNTech targeting highly variant viruses, our subunit platform targeting viruses that remain relatively consistent season to season, and our conjugate vaccine platform designed to help prevent bacterial infections.  We have achieved FDA approvals of vaccines derived from each platform within the last year and aim to further expand our leadership with additional vaccine candidates in development.  Today, I will provide information on our standalone flu vaccine candidate, flu-COVID combination vaccine candidates and next gen pneumococcal vaccine candidate.  We are pleased to announce that we achieved both primary endpoints in the 18 to 64-year-old cohort of our ongoing Phase 3 flu trial. In the trial, our first-gen mRNA flu vaccine candidate demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to a licensed flu vaccine at the time of the primary analysis. This represents the first and only demonstration of efficacy and superiority for an mRNA-based flu vaccine candidate.  In this age cohort, efficacy was maintained through the trial's end of season analysis, with our candidate remaining non-inferior to the licensed comparator. Safety was similar to standard flu vaccine.  The primary and end of season efficacy analyses considered both influenza A and B cases collectively. The vast majority of cases recorded in our trial, and during the 2022/2023 flu season overall, were flu A cases.  Immunogenicity data showed robust antibody responses against influenza A compared to licensed flu vaccine. Humoral responses against influenza B were lower than those achieved with the comparator. Recall that our standalone flu vaccine Phase 3 study also includes a 65 and older cohort that we previously shared encouraging T cell data for all four strains from the Phase 2 study in this cohort. Our belief is that the ability of the vaccine candidate to induce T cell responses may contribute to the improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. We expect a readout from this age group later this year.  To address the lower B responses seen with our first-gen standalone flu candidate, Pfizer created next-generation reformulations. These were incorporated into our mRNA flu candidates in combination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which I will review now.  In positive Phase 1/2 topline data announced last week, we observed that reformulation of the lead flu candidates resulted in improved immunogenicity against influenza B, allowing us to meet all criteria for advancement to Phase 3. In the trial, our lead candidate formulations induced robust immune responses, with point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios that were consistent with criteria applied to approved vaccines for all matched flu and SARS-CoV-2 strains.  Notably, point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios with selected candidate formulations were greater than one relative to the licensed comparator for all matched flu vaccine strains. The safety profiles of evaluated candidates were consistent with Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine. Following these positive immunogenicity data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the coming months.  Successfully developing a broad seasonal vaccine franchise anchored around a modFlu mRNA vaccine is a key priority, as it may allow us to tap into the nearly 50% annual flu vaccination rate in US adults.  We are taking a differentiated approach in pursuit of this goal, leveraging both mRNA and protein subunit technologies. Our development program includes double and triple combination vaccines to potentially help protect against flu, COVID-19, and RSV.  Now, turning to PREVNAR, I'll start by reminding you that this is the only PCV business with an FDA indication for pneumonia in adults. Providing protection specifically against pneumococcal pneumonia is critical. It's the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults, leading to 150,000 US hospitalizations each year. The prevalence of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is more than 15-fold greater than that of invasive pneumococcal disease in US adults 50 and older.  PREVNAR's pneumonia indication is supported by the CAPiTA trial, which was enabled by a pneumococcal vaccine-na\u00efve population and proprietary assay. These innovative characteristics make it challenging for others to conduct a similar study, given the high level of pneumococcal vaccine coverage that exists today.  CAPiTA's innovative design and landmark results helped establish our leading and differentiated position in the PCV space. To solidify this position, we are committed to pursuing continued innovation. Our goal is to potentially maximize valency and improve immunogenicity while maintaining coverage of the serotypes clinically demonstrated to protect against pneumonia.  In line with this commitment, we have been developing a fourth-generation PCV candidate that builds on the PREVNAR business' 20-year-plus of innovation. Our next-generation technology leverages cutting-edge conjugation chemistry, carriers, and reformulations.  Using these new proprietary vaccine technologies, we observed a several fold improvement in select serotype immunogenicity in a monovalent Phase 1 study. Based on these data, we are confident that when we move this technology into our multivalent 4th generation candidate, we have the potential to achieve increased valency with improved serotype immunogenicity.  We are now advancing our fourth-generation candidate into a first-in-human trial, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023.  Finally, I will leave you with our list of milestones and call out the recent approvals of VELSIPITY for ulcerative colitis and PENBRAYA, the first pentavalent meningococcal vaccine.  Pfizer has delivered more than a dozen regulatory approvals this year alone. I'll also note the recent launches of ABRYSVO for maternal immunization and ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma.  Thank you. Let me turn it over to Francesca to start the Q&A session.  Francesca DeMartino Thanks, Michael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And I will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Operator, please assemble the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: I think I have a big picture question on your new launches, which is extremely important for your growth. Are you seeing any impact given, I think, vaccine fatigue that we've seen with COVID impacting RSV and pneumococcal vaccines? And how do you think about that impact as you think about 2023 and 2024? Do you think that will dissipate?\nAlbert Bourla: First of all, I think it's good when you have a portfolio. And we have a quite strong portfolio because we have RSV, we have COVID and we have pneumococcal in the respiratory front. But I think the biggest impact will be when and if we have combination products. We think that combination products will \u2013 because of their convenience, because of vaccines are preferred by payers with zero copay will increase basically the volumes and vaccination rates of all vaccines because of the convenience of one injection. And I think this is why you saw from Mikael all our efforts right now are in developing multiple combinations, so that consumers and physicians will have choice which ones to administer, always with the same convenience. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Huynh Trung with UBS.\nTrung Huynh: I have one on flu and then just one on danu. So on flu, can you confirm the comparator in the 18 to 64 and also the 64 age groups was the low dose flu vaccines? Is there a risk FDA is going to need data against high dose flu vaccines? And from a commercial perspective, do you think you still need high dose flu data, the comparator against high dose flu data given that's what's recommended by CDC in the older population?  And then on danu, should we just \u2013 just on the data that we expect before year-end, what do you need to show in that in order to move it into Phase 3 trials? Is something similar to the Phase 2 we saw earlier this year enough to move it to Phase 3.\nAlbert Bourla: On the flu comparator, I can confirm that it is the low dose on the younger population because that's the only one that's allowed. So on the older population, we are having studies now with a very low dose, but we will do also with the higher dose. So we have both.  On danu, it's not much to say. We need to wait to see the data. Clearly, when you are moving ahead with a program like that, you need to see the totality of the data and we are working now intensively to be able to have those data presented before year-end. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I wanted to continue on the oral obesity theme for a second. I noticed there's a new molecule, 522, that you moved into Phase 1. And my question is, is the chemical structure and the chemical series akin to the danu GLP-1 programs?  And also, Albert, you mentioned you want to wait to see the danu GLP-1 Phase 2 data, but I realized the trial has been wrapped up for a few weeks now. Have you not seen it yet?\nAlbert Bourla: Michael, would you like to take the question about the new molecule and the danu?\nMikael Dolsten: We are building a platform around the GLP-1 area and also obesity in general with multiple different mechanisms and compounds. We remain focused on the danuglipron readout, as Albert mentioned, as our main opportunity here for getting data to review for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. But there are many indications where GLP may play a role outside the typical metabolic. So this one gives us just more options to explore and have interesting data. And you will see more new mechanism also coming from Pfizer. We have a pretty strong effort here. \nOperator: Next we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two for me. I was just wondering, on your RSV launch, how we should think about the potential for revaccination in 2024. And then, on your DMD gene therapy program, I think you've previously talked about having interim data by year-end. Is that still the case and does the recent competitor data make you more or less optimistic in your program?\nAlbert Bourla: First of all, let me make a comment that the recent data that we saw about the DMD failures is a very, very bad news for patients. We are really [indiscernible]. I hope there will be a solution for them with the discussion with the FDA, although I can't comment. Now, on our DMD program, I will ask Mikael to comment on that. And then, on the RSV, Angela. Mikael, why don't you start with the DMD? Then Angela, go through RSV?\nMikael Dolsten: [indiscernible] we also always said and when someone fails a study. We are very encouraged about getting to the readout. You are right, there is an opportunity for an interim analysis around year-end with final analysis second half of next year. And overall, I think our interim read for DMD have shown a very consistent effect across biomarkers and functional endpoint. And what has been differentiated it so far is that when you look at the functional data we have reported, it has been giving encouraging signals in both the younger and the slightly older boys. And that has not been seen with the other company you referred to. So, in a way, I remain, as earlier, very positive about looking forward to the readout and let the data tell the story. But of course, this makes our gene therapy, in a way, the main game to us.\nAlbert Bourla: Then there was a question, Angela, on the RSV.\nAngela Hwang: Well, as you heard, during the HCIP discussions, our recommendation for ABRYSVO today is really one around shared clinical decision making. But we also were \u2013 we were asked to bring additional data when they are ready. And so, just to confirm that we will have additional data in vaccine effectiveness in broader populations, we will have safety data also in broader populations, we will also have immunogenicity data in younger populations. All of this will be, I think, available in the next year when we plan to bring this back to the CDC. In addition to that, actually omitted to mention that we'll also have second season efficacy data. So, we'll be able to bring this totality of data together to determine whether the recommendations will change, but also what the vaccination schedule will be. So that's to come in 2024.\nOperator: Next, we have Steve Scala with TD Cowen. \nSteve Scala: As was just noted a couple of minutes ago, the danu data has reached its primary completion. It was a while ago. Albert, when you were asked, you stressed the words totality of the data, implying that you could have seen some part of the data. Mikael, when you were asked, you talked about different indications. These are not confidence building statements. So, I'm curious, what have you seen? And, Mikael, you've said in the past, you were absolutely encouraged and confident in the profile of danu? Are you still absolutely encouraged and confident? So that's the first question.  Secondly, a competitor spoke to potentially COVID derived decrease in diagnosis of inflammatory diseases, such as UC, and I'm wondering if you've seen any of that. \nAlbert Bourla: I think you likely misunderstood my comments on the totality. It has nothing to do with any data that I have seen because I haven't, right? So, the data have not been presented to \u2013 I don't think [indiscernible] has been completed yet. So, I will ask also Mikael to comment on that, but don't bridge with anything on the totality of the data. What I meant it is that we are doing this, we are doing the release formulation, which will make it once a day. There are multiple things, but we need to wait and see. We see how competitors are doing before deciding what we will do. But the most important thing is to see what is the efficacy and safety of the study that will read out. So, nothing to read in my comment on historical data. So, Mikael, you want to add\u2026\nMikael Dolsten: Yeah, I can just echo what you said so well, Albert. We and I remain very enthusiastic to look forward, to see the data. We have not seen the final top line report coming out. So today, the study is still ongoing but will be available before year-end. Danuglipron has shown, as you know, some really interesting profile as a full agonist and it's our main opportunity and effort for obesity and Type 2 diabetes.  We got earlier today a question about new molecules that are coming in. And that's when I mentioned that our additional indications to pursue for such new molecules and we'll also have new mechanisms that are validated that's coming in in oral version. So it just punctuates our big effort we have around both these class and obesity and other disorders.\nAlbert Bourla: In essence, he's still excited.\nOperator: Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. \nLouise Chen: I wanted to ask you on this fourth generation PCV, how much additional serotype coverage will you have? And then, also on ABRYSVO, will that be available to pregnant women in the pharmacy? Or do they have to go to their OBGYN? And then lastly, just on danuglipron again, here, will you also have the modified release data before year-end.\nAlbert Bourla: Monadelphous, you want to take the PCV question and danu, but also, Angela, very quickly, ABRYSVO is available at the pharmacy.\nAngela Hwang: Yes, it's going to be available in pharmacies and doctors' offices and OBGYN offices. I think we have a real stocking advantage here, Louise, because anyone just needs to stock one product for two indications for both populations. So I think the uptake is to come. And certainly, the next few months, being that it's the winter, is when we begin to \u2013 we believe we'll see some good uptake.\nMikael Dolsten: On the PCV fourth generation, I hope you looked at today's data. And what you could see is that we are really the first company that have been able to put in place a whole set of new technology that can bring immune responses to a higher level than have been seen and that allow us to go with even more comprehensive coverage than the current 20. I'm not going to give your curiosity an answer how many serotype. I can just tell you it's considerable more than the 20.  On danu, we look upon danuglipron as the once-a-day QD molecule because of the reformulation technologies that were put in place and already generated some clinical data on and are now concluding. So that's really how we look upon danuglipron and we'll have final data on the best formulation option early next year. But as Albert said, we're enthusiastic to look forward to the efficacy data later this year. So very exciting time.\nOperator: Next, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\nDavid Risinger: I have another question on danuglipron since it appears to be the company's number one pipeline candidate based upon your forecasts. So regarding the Phase 2b results that are expected soon, how should we expect Pfizer to share those results? And then, with regard to the once daily formulation that you just mentioned, Mikael, will that be ready for the Phase 3 start assuming that the company moves to start Phase 3 shortly after the Phase 2b results are generated? \nAlbert Bourla: The first question, given the importance [indiscernible]. But with a press release, we've made them publicly available. Now, Mikael, you want to take the second part of the question of David?\nMikael Dolsten: Yeah, I can first echo what Albert and I said, we look forward with enthusiasm to get the danuglipron obesity data later this year. And of course, as Albert said, pending totality of reviewing everything we have, we have made a lot of progress and been able to accelerate the QD danu. Now, we're waiting for some more clinical data early next year, but I think it's within our reach. If we decide to do, to start the pivotal study next year to do it with an once a day molecule.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan.\nChris Schott: Just two for me here. First, can you just comment a little bit more on what we're seeing with Nurtec and the ramp relative to your expectations?  And maybe just as part of that, just any color on pricing we're seeing within the market today and how we should think about that going forward.  And then my second question was on 2024. I know you're not giving guidance today. But as you look at where consensus has kind of shaken out post the COVID and cost restructuring updates, and if the earnings are in kind of low $3 range at this point, I guess just are there any directional kind of pushes or pulls in the numbers that you feel the Street isn't capturing properly and should be kind of thinking about before we get your kind of formal guidance as we look to early next year?\nDave Denton: Obviously, it's a little over 2024. I would just say that, clearly, we had a clearing event as it relates to our COVID expectations for this year. So a lot of that risk is behind us as we think about the balance this year. I do expect that the balance of this year will be very informative, particularly in the US as we think about utilization trends, both for vaccination rates, importantly Paxlovid, here in the US that will allow us to have a better clarity as we cycle into 2024 of the utilization around those specific products, which will still be meaningful to us at an enterprise level.  Clearly, when we get to providing guidance, we'll give you a lot of information beneath that, so you can get a good sense of our \u2013 importantly, our non-COVID products which continue to trend very favorably and very well. And we can layer on, I'll say, the optionality associated with our COVID franchise as we cycle into next year.  So, obviously, a lot more to come. We're looking forward to sharing those very specific details after the first of the year.\nMark Southey: And then, Angela, about Nurtec launch \u2013 not launch, about the Nurtec performance in the marketplace, including the price.\nAngela Hwang: Thanks for the question, Chris, because it's a great opportunity for us to share that we are seeing Nurtec perform just as we expected. In fact, with some really strong performance indicators that I'd like to share with you.  First of all, from a TRx perspective, we grew 28% compared to last year this time, and sequentially, we grew 6% versus last quarter. In fact, on October 20, we saw the highest week of TRx's and NRxs to date.  That growth is also seen in the number of prescribers. Just this quarter alone, we had 73,000 prescribers writing Nurtec. And we are now moving at a clip of about 23,000 writer a week which is 30% more than Ubrelvy and double that of Qulipta.  Another good place to look is also in new to brand starts, right, NBRxs. And when you look at that, NBRx growth for Nurtec is higher than Ubrelvy and Qulipta in all the deciles of physicians, but particularly in the decile 8 to 10, which, as you know, is where the highest prescribers are or who are the highest prescribers.  And then, when you look at pill count, we see something interesting there too. We have been very intensely or intently driving our pill pack toward the larger pill pack size, which is the 16 pack because of our prevention indication. And so, when you look at the totality of all the pills or the total volume of pills, we have a leading market share there, more than 50%.  And so, I think when you look at all these indicators, at least from the way that we're looking at it, it's very positive story. It's exactly how we see it. The expansion into primary care, as you heard in Albert's comments, is what it is that we're after. And today, only 17% of the entire market is oral CGRPs, which tells you that most of the market is still an opportunity for us and represents growth that we're really, really looking forward to. And I think that we put the right investments in the right places to generate this growth in the future.  From a pricing perspective, obviously, it's a product that is rebated, and so I think the way to think about it is that, from a patient perspective, which is where we really put a lot of focus, we want to make sure that our patients are able to get the scripts, are able to get access for Nurtec, especially as you consider that we're trying to mobilize people away from Topiramate and away from triptans on to all CGRPs.  So the gross to net effects here are significant. And you see that quarter-over-quarter because we are making sure that we're able to provide access to patients who deserve and are eligible for [indiscernible]. \nOperator: Next we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: And I have a question regarding your S1P etrasimod. Would love to get your thoughts on the labels. It seems like you could avoid a lot of cardiac monitoring, but at the same time there is this new requirement of eye exam as well as skin exam. How do you think about uptake, considering these examinations before the start of the treatment, given that these doctors are not used to it?\nMikael Dolsten: I'm happy to start on it. I think we have a very robust label for etrasimod. It's the only S1P in this drug class [indiscernible] that have a simple flat dosing and immediate start without any prior need for, let's say, cardiac rhythm exams, like the other prog in this class. All S1P have various eye exams to monitor. And I think our label similarly has a recommendation to do that. So it's really nothing new. And our efficacy data, and you see, has been very favorable. So we are very optimistic that this can be a true best-in-class ulcerative colitis. \nAngela Hwang: I was just going to add to that that, competitively, we believe that we have an excellent efficacy and safety profile. We don't have a need to titrate up, as Mikael said. And also, our assessment of standard versus our competitors at the initiation of therapy. So I think that this is a level playing field that we're in. Certainly patient support is an area of focus for us, right, to ensure that patients are getting the assessments that they need. But we feel that we're \u2013 this is pretty standard practice and we'll be able to launch this product as planned.\nOperator: Next, we have Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. \nGeoff Meacham: Just have a couple of quick ones. First, I know Seagen obviously hasn't closed yet. But there's all the emphasis on the ADCs from ESMO. Does it affect how you guys prioritize the pipeline or maybe investments you could make today commercially?  And the second question on danu, Mikael, I know a lot has been asked on the upcoming data, but from a commercial perspective, like where do you see the bigger opportunities for differentiation and metabolic? Is it really just oral administration in obesity? Or do you guys look more aggressively at related indications like cardio, renal, et cetera. \nAlbert Bourla: Chris, do you want to take a question about the Seagen and the pipeline?\nChris Boshoff: Obviously, we remain very confident that we will close Seagen towards the end of this year, beginning next year. As you pointed out, there's a significant interest now in ADCs because of the potential that they could replace most of the chemotherapeutics in the future for most cancer types.  Seagen obviously has a significant track record with both the current approved ADCs from the laboratories and, as you've seen, three potential registration phase trials just read out and passed up to Kaiser [indiscernible] but also with the small molecule to Kaiser.  They recently started two Phase 3 studies, one with tisotumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced metastatic, HER2 positive or HER2 low bladder cancer. This is a program that we're very excited about. Already tisotumab received previously breakthrough therapeutic innovation in the US. And they're also just about to start another Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer with the B6A integrin beta-6 antibodies. So we remain very confident in their portfolio and the depth of expertise they're bringing to the development and discovery of ADCs.\nMikael Dolsten: I think you asked about how could a new oral GLP in obesity be positioned for maximal attractiveness and using danu as one example, pending, of course, our excitement to see the data. Well, clearly, as obesity and Type 2 diabetes with overweight are moving from being treated from an endocrinologist and metabolic physicians increasingly now to primary care, particularly with the impressive effects of this drug class on obesity and bodyweight. Oral agents in general are preferred. So I think, once a day drugs such as the new reformulated potential danuglipron would have an interesting role there.  I think there is also a growing discussion among opinion leaders in the field that the patients regain weight when they stop the injectable. And in general, they are only available for maybe a year. So an oral agent that could be taken for a longer period could also play a really interesting role to maintain body weight at a low level.  And finally, you're absolute right, the new data for this drug class suggests that patients could benefit from both cardiac and renal protection. And oral agents allow you to build combination with drugs that already are used in this population, such as the 52, to protect the heart etc. So I think that's why there is such a big interest in drugs in this class. \nOperator: Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: I have a couple of questions on danuglipron. Early dataset showed a QTc signal. Do you think that was a red herring that won't show up in later data? To me, when I just think about drug classes and seeing QTc signals, seems like it often persists in later datasets.  Second question on mRNA flu. You mentioned that safety is the same as licensed vaccines. Does that mean tolerability was as well? I usually think of safety and tolerability as technically being different from each other. \nAlbert Bourla: Mikael, both questions for you. QTc for danu and tolerability of flu vaccines? \nMikael Dolsten: We have, I think, more than 1,400 patients on danuglipron and it's a very safe drug. It's a very safe drug. And we look forward to the readout on efficacy, as we have said. before year-end. So that's very straightforward.  mRNA flu, you had a very good comment, particularly in initial studies, tolerability is really what we focus on. And tolerability was similar to standard of care available vaccines, or the other mRNA vaccines experienced from Pfizer. And we haven't really had any concerns about safety. So on both tolerability and safety, the statement stands that it looks like previous versions of our vaccines.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. \nChris Shibutani: Two questions, if I may. On the cost savings program, you've been outlining what the plan is for 2024. But if we look at the pattern of the spending for R&D and SI&A, in the quarter you just reported, I would observe that the magnitude of reduction in the R&D spend was greater than expected relative to SI&A, how should we be interpreting this numbers or anything to read across in terms of the relative amount of cost reductions coming from SI&A versus R&D on the forward?  And then a question on ABRYSVO. First quarter sales were solid. Can you just elaborate how much may have been attributable to, for instance, inventory stocking versus actual demand? And if we look at prescription data, looks like from the retail setting, there was about a 30% market share. Is this similar to what you're observing in the broader market? And how is this conferring with your expectations?\nMark Southey: Let me ask David to answer the question about the R&D and SI&A expenses. And then Angela will take ABRYSVO.\nDave Denton: Chris, on the cost program, I would not read into the allocation of savings in 2023 as it relates to 2024. Obviously, we have a fairly robust program up and running today. We're working aggressively on those programs and beginning to implement those programs. As we cycle into 2024, we'll give you and the markets specific color on how to think about those cost savings as we wrap into next year.\nMark Southey: Angela?\nAngela Hwang: We're really pleased with our performance on ABRYSVO. It has exceeded our expectations. You first asked whether this is all about stocking. And I can say that it isn't. Of course, there was stocking effect in the beginning because this was a new vaccine. But we're also closely tracking vaccination rates and uptake. And what you see is that there is very fast uptake that really benefit from the fact that this was approved and in market prior to the vaccination season actually happening. So it was able to ride off the coattails of flu vaccinations, which you know are very high. Right? September, October. We have about a 70% co-administration rate. The performance we're seeing on ABRYSVO is truly driven by vaccinations. To your comment about market share, yes, we are seeing a similar market share to what you have just said. That is because, right now, the retail setting is driving a lot of the vaccinations. But don't forget that that's not where all vaccinations are taking place. We also have non-retail settings such as health systems, doctors' offices, those are also being engaged. And those particular settings, Pfizer actually has a leading preference. They are smaller in proportion, but still. So I think we have to look at all channels of the market.  Finally, I think that, just from a momentum perspective, we expect things to continue. The vaccinations really are happening throughout this time now \u2013 October, November, December are big vaccination months. From where we are right now, RSV is only 5% of the entire vaccination rate of the eligible populations. So I think that the conclusion is we're very early in the innings of this launch. It's doing better than we thought. But where we are going to be, I think, is a place where there's tremendous opportunity for driving uptake in older adults, but also maternal, which, as you know, we just got the approval for.\nOperator: Next, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Maybe if you go back to oral danu, when we do get the Phase 2 data, what should our expectation be around communicating plans for Phase 3, which I guess is just a quicker way of saying, what's a reasonable expectation for how quickly you could turn around the Phase 2 and start a Phase 3 and how much work Pfizer has already done on that front? And then, maybe just coming out of ESMO, on the back of the EV-302 data and the response with Pfizer saying that reaffirms their expectations or represents upside to their expectations when the deal was originally announced.\nAlbert Bourla: On the danu, let me take it, so I can spare a little bit Mikael's time. We are expecting the data to show up before the end of the year. And of course, it's an important event. So we will have to make it publicly known when we know the data. And of course, when we are ready with our Phase 3, and we hope that the data are good, so that we can move into Phase 3. And I hope that we are going to do it in an expedient manner because speed is of essence in this battle between competing molecules. But we will announce our plans for Phase 3. I know the interest is very high right now. But I want to be very prudent in not saying things without the data. The data or the click of the data, we haven't seen it again.  Now, let me move to Chris, so that we can discuss about the ESMO.\nChris Boshoff: Thank you for raising 301. It's a truly monumental data for the field of bladder cancer, and urothelial cancer. And as you pointed out, with overall survival and median \u2013progression-free survival nearly double, moving median overall survival for this population now nearly towards three years, we expect the final data to be above \u2013 longer than 31.5 months. So this just reaffirms our belief that antibody drug conjugates could become a standard of care across the treatment paradigm for many, many different tumor types.\nOperator: Next, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies. \nIvy Wang: This is Ivy on for Akash. Our question is also on danuglipron. So, [indiscernible] release version, is there any possibility to do a bridging study for QD formulation? And also, for danu, I think as we've heard a lot of times on the call that the trial [indiscernible] completed in October. I know you haven't seen the top line data. So at this point, are we waiting for data from this lower four week titration cohort? So would it be fair to say that you will have to continue the program already if there were any clinically significant theories, issues with danu?\nMikael Dolsten: On the once a day reformulated danu, we have initially tested a standard swellable core technology, and could show that it worked very well with danu. Now to be able also to incorporate a more sophisticated technology, we worked on a matrix technology, and all data suggests it's going to a really intriguing alternative because, as you know, in diabetes oral drugs and obesity, you will over time end up with incorporating different trials to prevent different downstream effects. And that's the beautiful of having these type of novel technology that you have a potential in the future to go to fix those combination. And we are really masters in developing sophisticated formulations and we will have this available in 2024.\nMark Southey: And there was a second part I think, or not. There was a second part on danu?\nOperator: Next we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: Two questions on vaccines for me, please. First on RSV, in August, GSK filed a lawsuit against Pfizer alleging patent infringement. So I wonder if you could just talk to the next steps here. Perhaps a timeline that you anticipate for this? And should we think that this could ultimately result in some form of royalty payments from Pfizer to GSK?  And then, on PENBRAYA, how does the recent ACIP recommendation set against your expectations for the sales ramp and peak potential for this vaccine? If the vaccine is effectively only used for dose two of three, does that significantly reduce the commercial opportunity you had anticipated for the vaccine?\nDoug Lankler: It's very, very early stages with respect to the RSV litigation. We have patents, we feel strongly about our own intellectual property. And it's certainly too early to say whether one party or the other will be required to pay any royalties or otherwise. Very early stages in that regard.\nAngela Hwang: We continue to feel confident about the peak sales. The reason is that, right now, we have the first set of recommendations, but the ACIP has also told us that we will have the opportunity again to come back next year when we have additional data, which is when we will have the opportunity to look at the schedule or how [indiscernible] are being \u2013 the schedule that they're being delivered today. And we'll have an opportunity again to take a look at the benefit of PENBRAYA in this population. So I feel like it's great that we have an opportunity to get out now and to begin vaccinating our teenagers. We'll have a second bite at the apple, which will allow us to achieve our peak sales.\nOperator: Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi. \nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions. Would you comment on your stake in RVT-3101, the TL1A, pending the approval of the licensing of the asset to Roche? Will you hang on to it? Or is that subject to divestment?  Second question for Chris. Just looking at the recent EV-302 data and with \u2013 you seem to have the Seagen portfolio, when you think about the combination of ADCs with pembro or with a PD-1, do you believe the efficacy that you're seeing is associated with that hedging or do you think it's true synergy through an immunologic mechanism of increased cell death?\nAamir Malik: I think we're very pleased with the outcome of the TL1A program. When we created Televant, we did this as an R&D prioritization decision. Just as a reminder, this was a Phase 2 program that required significant Phase 3 investment. And so we held on to a 25% stake. We also had rights to royalties on US sales, as well as the full ex-US and ex-Japan rights. And we did that all without any R&D spend. So Roche's proposed acquisition of Televant will give us access to about $1.75 billion of pretax cash, which is the translation of our stake, and we still retain all the other rights. So we're looking forward to having Roche as a partner. We're looking forward to the investments that they're going to make in advancing the clinical stage programs on TL1A and benefiting from the outcome of those.\nChris Boshoff: That's a very good question. As you know, Seagen pioneered the MMAE auristatin-based payloads, and we see this potential synergy in combination with a PD-1 with [indiscernible]. Although Seagen does have the next generation of ADCs with topo 1 that will enter the clinic this year \u2013 next year, we don't know yet if the topo 1s are going to show the similar type of immunogenicity as what appears to happen with the MMAE auristatin based payloads. So I think we're very confident that Seagen has both topo 1 as well as auristatin based payloads in case with topo 1s we do not see what appears [indiscernible].\nOperator: Our last question comes from Evan Seigerman with the BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: I have one on danu and then a bigger picture one. So, a point of clarification on danuglipron. Mikael, is the ultimate goal to develop the fixed dose combination with, say, an SGLT2, other anti-diabetes drugs. You kind of mentioned that in your commentary. And taking a big step back, how should we think about how you risk adjusted your long term revenue guidance? Did you plan on updating this figure as you have clinical or regulatory successes or failures, for example, with the approval of etrasimod? \nMikael Dolsten: The near term goal is really look at the data, as we have said, both Albert and myself, and pending review, of course, there's an option with a once a day danu to move forward in obesity and diabetes.  I think we have commented that the upside with oral drugs are many in the sector. That's why it has been such a big interest. And that includes fixed dose combination, which aren't available with injectables. But we will keep it simple and clear. We'll review the data and take a decision about potential in obesity and diabetes once a day danu. That's the near term.\nAlbert Bourla: And also about your question, if we are going to change the $20 billions or the $25 billions that we have declared, first of all, the $25 billion is billions that we're going to acquire revenue in 2030. According to our estimates, we have acquired, pending Seagen acquisition, $20 billion so far. If you see the analyst expectations for this acquisitions, at the end of 2030, are very, very close to what we have right now. And I think this is trending very nice.  When you see the internal pipe, the launches that we are having from our internal pipeline, which we declared $20 billions, there is a gap between what we believe and what the analysts believe. And this is where we are focusing our attention right now. It's very early with the launches. Some of them are doing better than what we thought. Some of them are doing worse than what we thought. And if we realize that the totality of $20 billion is not anymore what we think will be, of course, we will update.\nDave Denton: But I think what is important is that is if you look at our business, our core business is performing nicely. We continue to make traction. We have obviously a lot of launches that we've completed and still several ahead of us. We're excited about what Seagen could potentially bring to the company as we think about our focus now in oncology. And then importantly, I think we've rebaselined, if you will, the COVID franchises. Think about utilization in the back half of this year and cycle into next year. We will then take a step back and look at what would be prudent as we think about the revenue in totality of this company as we cycle into 2024 and beyond. So I think you look forward to, as we begin going into 2024, those expectation of laying those out specifically.\nAlbert Bourla: Okay, thank you very much. I would like just to say that if you walk away from today's call with just one takeaway, it should be that I think Pfizer's future remains bright. We have rebased our COVID expectations, and now I think it's very easy for everyone to be able to model what I think will be stable COVID revenues going forward. And with the recent \u2013 particularly with the recent amended Paxlovid supply agreement. And of course, we are having very strong performance of our [indiscernible] and new products portfolio excluding COVID. It's 10% growth this quarter. And that position us to be able to have growing things going forward.  So I will now bring this call to an end. Thank you for joining us and have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's Pfizer third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Francesca. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.  Pfizer continues to have a far-reaching and positive impact on human health. Through the first nine months of the year, more than 457 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. Compared with the first nine months of 2022, we have reached more patients in several key therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiovascular disease and anti-infectives.  Patients will always be our North Star, and these figures serve as a testament to our leadership in innovation and our commitment to understanding and serving patients' needs.  During the third quarter, we were encouraged by the continued strong performance of Pfizer's non-COVID products, with revenue from these products growing 10% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. We saw significant contributions from new launches and robust year-over-year growth for several key in-line brands.  Our recently launched respiratory syncytial virus, the RSV, vaccine \u2013 it's called ABRYSVO \u2013 contributed $375 million in US revenues. With the recent approval of the maternal indication, Pfizer is the only company with an RSV vaccine approved for preventing RSV in older adults and in infants via maternal immunization. We believe ABRYSVO will be a significant and growing contributor to revenue as many customers have indicated to us that protecting both populations with one vaccine is desirable and a competitive advantage for ABRYSVO.  In the US alone, there are approximately 80 million adults over age 60 who are eligible for RSV vaccination, and an estimated 1.5 million pregnant women are eligible for maternal immunization with our RSV vaccine between September 2023 and January 2024.  Nurtec, Vydura and Oxbryta, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022, contributed $233 million and $85 million in global revenues, respectively. For Nurtec, in the US, oral CGRPs represent about 17% of the migraine market, and the unmet need is high. We believe oral CGRPs can ultimately be the first-line therapy for migraine and could eventually account for as much as 40% of the overall migraine market.  Primary care is a clear source of potential growth in the migraine marketplace. Year to date, primary care healthcare providers wrote more than 6.1 million prescriptions for Triptans compared with approximately 1 million for oral CGRPs, which highlights a significant potential opportunity for growth.  Regarding Oxbryta, there is significant burden of illness and unmet need for patients suffering from sickle cell disease. An estimated 12 million people around the world have SCD, sickle cell disease, with the highest prevalence in countries with the lowest resources. While in the US, 95% of children survive to adulthood, 99% of children in other regions will die before they reach their 5th birthday, many without ever being diagnosed. Our Vyndaqel family of products, including Vyndaqel, Vyndamax and Vynmac, recorded 47% operational growth globally compared with the third quarter of 2022. This growth was driven largely by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, primarily in the US and developed Europe. We estimate there are between 120,000 and 150,000 people suffering from ATTR cardiomyopathy, with the majority still not yet diagnosed.  The largest unmet need continues to be the lack of general understanding and ability to diagnose this deadly disease, which is why we are focused on educational activities to expedite diagnosis and get appropriate patients on to treatment with the product as the proven standard of care. Such efforts significantly contributed to this quarter's revenue increase in the US. And our Prevnar family of products, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, saw global revenue rise 15% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by strong patient demand for Prevnar 20 Adult in the US, the US approval of Prevnar 20 Pediatric and associated stocking, and growth of Prevenar 13 Pediatric in certain emerging markets. These were partially offset by anticipated lower market share in the US for Prevnar Pediatric due to competitive entry. Of note, Prevnar 20 Adult remains the category-leading pneumococcal vaccine for adults in the US with a 95% market share in the third quarter.  Year-to-date, revenues for our non-COVID products have grown 7% operationally, and we remain on track to deliver 6% to 8% operational revenue growth for these products for the full year.  We continue to progress toward our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. Recent milestones include US and EU approvals and launch of ABRYSVO in pregnant individuals; US approval and launch of Elrexfio in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; US approval of our Braftovi+Mektovi combination in BRAF-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; US approval of VELSIPITY for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis; EC approval of Litfulo for severe alopecia areata; and US approval of PENBRAYA, the first and only pentavalent vaccine that provides coverage against the five most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 years of age.  To date, we have now executed 13 of the 19 originally identified potential launches, with four other products approved and preparations being made for their launch. In fact, five of the six remaining potential launches have been largely de-risked from a technical perspective. The only one remaining would be our mRNA flu candidate.  Given our recent positive results from our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate and pending results for our 65-and-older first-generation Phase 3 standalone mRNA flu study, timing for our standalone mRNA flu is now expected after 2024. If successful, our next-generation mRNA flu/COVID combination candidate is expected to market in 2025. Mikael will share more about these programs shortly.  We remain excited about our proposed acquisition of Seagen and the dramatic impact we think this combination can have on human health. One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. So, conquering cancer would have an almost unimaginable impact on humanity.  We recently gained unconditional antitrust clearance from the EC, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance by the US FTC.  We have raised $31 billion in acquisition financing so far and continue to expect incremental 2030 risk-adjusted revenues in excess of $10 billion and expected cost efficiencies of $1 billion to be realized by the end of year three post-closing without impacting any R&D programs.  With that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. So Dave? First of all, I think it's good when you have a portfolio. And we have a quite strong portfolio because we have RSV, we have COVID and we have pneumococcal in the respiratory front. But I think the biggest impact will be when and if we have combination products. We think that combination products will \u2013 because of their convenience, because of vaccines are preferred by payers with zero copay will increase basically the volumes and vaccination rates of all vaccines because of the convenience of one injection. And I think this is why you saw from Mikael all our efforts right now are in developing multiple combinations, so that consumers and physicians will have choice which ones to administer, always with the same convenience. On the flu comparator, I can confirm that it is the low dose on the younger population because that's the only one that's allowed. So on the older population, we are having studies now with a very low dose, but we will do also with the higher dose. So we have both.  On danu, it's not much to say. We need to wait to see the data. Clearly, when you are moving ahead with a program like that, you need to see the totality of the data and we are working now intensively to be able to have those data presented before year-end. Michael, would you like to take the question about the new molecule and the danu? First of all, let me make a comment that the recent data that we saw about the DMD failures is a very, very bad news for patients. We are really [indiscernible]. I hope there will be a solution for them with the discussion with the FDA, although I can't comment. Now, on our DMD program, I will ask Mikael to comment on that. And then, on the RSV, Angela. Mikael, why don't you start with the DMD? Then Angela, go through RSV? Then there was a question, Angela, on the RSV. I think you likely misunderstood my comments on the totality. It has nothing to do with any data that I have seen because I haven't, right? So, the data have not been presented to \u2013 I don't think [indiscernible] has been completed yet. So, I will ask also Mikael to comment on that, but don't bridge with anything on the totality of the data. What I meant it is that we are doing this, we are doing the release formulation, which will make it once a day. There are multiple things, but we need to wait and see. We see how competitors are doing before deciding what we will do. But the most important thing is to see what is the efficacy and safety of the study that will read out. So, nothing to read in my comment on historical data. So, Mikael, you want to add... In essence, he's still excited. Monadelphous, you want to take the PCV question and danu, but also, Angela, very quickly, ABRYSVO is available at the pharmacy. The first question, given the importance [indiscernible]. But with a press release, we've made them publicly available. Now, Mikael, you want to take the second part of the question of David? Chris, do you want to take a question about the Seagen and the pipeline? Mikael, both questions for you. QTc for danu and tolerability of flu vaccines? On the danu, let me take it, so I can spare a little bit Mikael's time. We are expecting the data to show up before the end of the year. And of course, it's an important event. So we will have to make it publicly known when we know the data. And of course, when we are ready with our Phase 3, and we hope that the data are good, so that we can move into Phase 3. And I hope that we are going to do it in an expedient manner because speed is of essence in this battle between competing molecules. But we will announce our plans for Phase 3. I know the interest is very high right now. But I want to be very prudent in not saying things without the data. The data or the click of the data, we haven't seen it again.  Now, let me move to Chris, so that we can discuss about the ESMO. And also about your question, if we are going to change the $20 billions or the $25 billions that we have declared, first of all, the $25 billion is billions that we're going to acquire revenue in 2030. According to our estimates, we have acquired, pending Seagen acquisition, $20 billion so far. If you see the analyst expectations for this acquisitions, at the end of 2030, are very, very close to what we have right now. And I think this is trending very nice.  When you see the internal pipe, the launches that we are having from our internal pipeline, which we declared $20 billions, there is a gap between what we believe and what the analysts believe. And this is where we are focusing our attention right now. It's very early with the launches. Some of them are doing better than what we thought. Some of them are doing worse than what we thought. And if we realize that the totality of $20 billion is not anymore what we think will be, of course, we will update. Okay, thank you very much. I would like just to say that if you walk away from today's call with just one takeaway, it should be that I think Pfizer's future remains bright. We have rebased our COVID expectations, and now I think it's very easy for everyone to be able to model what I think will be stable COVID revenues going forward. And with the recent \u2013 particularly with the recent amended Paxlovid supply agreement. And of course, we are having very strong performance of our [indiscernible] and new products portfolio excluding COVID. It's 10% growth this quarter. And that position us to be able to have growing things going forward.  So I will now bring this call to an end. Thank you for joining us and have a great rest of your day."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Today, I will share important updates from our robust respiratory vaccine portfolio.  Our respiratory vaccines are built upon three cutting-edge platforms that enable us to bring the right science to the right pathogen. These include our mRNA platform in partnership with BioNTech targeting highly variant viruses, our subunit platform targeting viruses that remain relatively consistent season to season, and our conjugate vaccine platform designed to help prevent bacterial infections.  We have achieved FDA approvals of vaccines derived from each platform within the last year and aim to further expand our leadership with additional vaccine candidates in development.  Today, I will provide information on our standalone flu vaccine candidate, flu-COVID combination vaccine candidates and next gen pneumococcal vaccine candidate.  We are pleased to announce that we achieved both primary endpoints in the 18 to 64-year-old cohort of our ongoing Phase 3 flu trial. In the trial, our first-gen mRNA flu vaccine candidate demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to a licensed flu vaccine at the time of the primary analysis. This represents the first and only demonstration of efficacy and superiority for an mRNA-based flu vaccine candidate.  In this age cohort, efficacy was maintained through the trial's end of season analysis, with our candidate remaining non-inferior to the licensed comparator. Safety was similar to standard flu vaccine.  The primary and end of season efficacy analyses considered both influenza A and B cases collectively. The vast majority of cases recorded in our trial, and during the 2022/2023 flu season overall, were flu A cases.  Immunogenicity data showed robust antibody responses against influenza A compared to licensed flu vaccine. Humoral responses against influenza B were lower than those achieved with the comparator. Recall that our standalone flu vaccine Phase 3 study also includes a 65 and older cohort that we previously shared encouraging T cell data for all four strains from the Phase 2 study in this cohort. Our belief is that the ability of the vaccine candidate to induce T cell responses may contribute to the improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. We expect a readout from this age group later this year.  To address the lower B responses seen with our first-gen standalone flu candidate, Pfizer created next-generation reformulations. These were incorporated into our mRNA flu candidates in combination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which I will review now.  In positive Phase 1/2 topline data announced last week, we observed that reformulation of the lead flu candidates resulted in improved immunogenicity against influenza B, allowing us to meet all criteria for advancement to Phase 3. In the trial, our lead candidate formulations induced robust immune responses, with point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios that were consistent with criteria applied to approved vaccines for all matched flu and SARS-CoV-2 strains.  Notably, point estimates for Geometric Mean Titer ratios with selected candidate formulations were greater than one relative to the licensed comparator for all matched flu vaccine strains. The safety profiles of evaluated candidates were consistent with Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine. Following these positive immunogenicity data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in the coming months.  Successfully developing a broad seasonal vaccine franchise anchored around a modFlu mRNA vaccine is a key priority, as it may allow us to tap into the nearly 50% annual flu vaccination rate in US adults.  We are taking a differentiated approach in pursuit of this goal, leveraging both mRNA and protein subunit technologies. Our development program includes double and triple combination vaccines to potentially help protect against flu, COVID-19, and RSV.  Now, turning to PREVNAR, I'll start by reminding you that this is the only PCV business with an FDA indication for pneumonia in adults. Providing protection specifically against pneumococcal pneumonia is critical. It's the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults, leading to 150,000 US hospitalizations each year. The prevalence of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is more than 15-fold greater than that of invasive pneumococcal disease in US adults 50 and older.  PREVNAR's pneumonia indication is supported by the CAPiTA trial, which was enabled by a pneumococcal vaccine-nai\u0308ve population and proprietary assay. These innovative characteristics make it challenging for others to conduct a similar study, given the high level of pneumococcal vaccine coverage that exists today.  CAPiTA's innovative design and landmark results helped establish our leading and differentiated position in the PCV space. To solidify this position, we are committed to pursuing continued innovation. Our goal is to potentially maximize valency and improve immunogenicity while maintaining coverage of the serotypes clinically demonstrated to protect against pneumonia.  In line with this commitment, we have been developing a fourth-generation PCV candidate that builds on the PREVNAR business' 20-year-plus of innovation. Our next-generation technology leverages cutting-edge conjugation chemistry, carriers, and reformulations.  Using these new proprietary vaccine technologies, we observed a several fold improvement in select serotype immunogenicity in a monovalent Phase 1 study. Based on these data, we are confident that when we move this technology into our multivalent 4th generation candidate, we have the potential to achieve increased valency with improved serotype immunogenicity.  We are now advancing our fourth-generation candidate into a first-in-human trial, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023.  Finally, I will leave you with our list of milestones and call out the recent approvals of VELSIPITY for ulcerative colitis and PENBRAYA, the first pentavalent meningococcal vaccine.  Pfizer has delivered more than a dozen regulatory approvals this year alone. I'll also note the recent launches of ABRYSVO for maternal immunization and ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma.  Thank you. Let me turn it over to Francesca to start the Q&A session.  Francesca DeMartino Thanks, Michael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And I will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Operator, please assemble the queue. We are building a platform around the GLP-1 area and also obesity in general with multiple different mechanisms and compounds. We remain focused on the danuglipron readout, as Albert mentioned, as our main opportunity here for getting data to review for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. But there are many indications where GLP may play a role outside the typical metabolic. So this one gives us just more options to explore and have interesting data. And you will see more new mechanism also coming from Pfizer. We have a pretty strong effort here. [indiscernible] we also always said and when someone fails a study. We are very encouraged about getting to the readout. You are right, there is an opportunity for an interim analysis around year-end with final analysis second half of next year. And overall, I think our interim read for DMD have shown a very consistent effect across biomarkers and functional endpoint. And what has been differentiated it so far is that when you look at the functional data we have reported, it has been giving encouraging signals in both the younger and the slightly older boys. And that has not been seen with the other company you referred to. So, in a way, I remain, as earlier, very positive about looking forward to the readout and let the data tell the story. But of course, this makes our gene therapy, in a way, the main game to us. Yeah, I can just echo what you said so well, Albert. We and I remain very enthusiastic to look forward, to see the data. We have not seen the final top line report coming out. So today, the study is still ongoing but will be available before year-end. Danuglipron has shown, as you know, some really interesting profile as a full agonist and it's our main opportunity and effort for obesity and Type 2 diabetes.  We got earlier today a question about new molecules that are coming in. And that's when I mentioned that our additional indications to pursue for such new molecules and we'll also have new mechanisms that are validated that's coming in in oral version. So it just punctuates our big effort we have around both these class and obesity and other disorders. On the PCV fourth generation, I hope you looked at today's data. And what you could see is that we are really the first company that have been able to put in place a whole set of new technology that can bring immune responses to a higher level than have been seen and that allow us to go with even more comprehensive coverage than the current 20. I'm not going to give your curiosity an answer how many serotype. I can just tell you it's considerable more than the 20.  On danu, we look upon danuglipron as the once-a-day QD molecule because of the reformulation technologies that were put in place and already generated some clinical data on and are now concluding. So that's really how we look upon danuglipron and we'll have final data on the best formulation option early next year. But as Albert said, we're enthusiastic to look forward to the efficacy data later this year. So very exciting time. Yeah, I can first echo what Albert and I said, we look forward with enthusiasm to get the danuglipron obesity data later this year. And of course, as Albert said, pending totality of reviewing everything we have, we have made a lot of progress and been able to accelerate the QD danu. Now, we're waiting for some more clinical data early next year, but I think it's within our reach. If we decide to do, to start the pivotal study next year to do it with an once a day molecule. I'm happy to start on it. I think we have a very robust label for etrasimod. It's the only S1P in this drug class [indiscernible] that have a simple flat dosing and immediate start without any prior need for, let's say, cardiac rhythm exams, like the other prog in this class. All S1P have various eye exams to monitor. And I think our label similarly has a recommendation to do that. So it's really nothing new. And our efficacy data, and you see, has been very favorable. So we are very optimistic that this can be a true best-in-class ulcerative colitis. I think you asked about how could a new oral GLP in obesity be positioned for maximal attractiveness and using danu as one example, pending, of course, our excitement to see the data. Well, clearly, as obesity and Type 2 diabetes with overweight are moving from being treated from an endocrinologist and metabolic physicians increasingly now to primary care, particularly with the impressive effects of this drug class on obesity and bodyweight. Oral agents in general are preferred. So I think, once a day drugs such as the new reformulated potential danuglipron would have an interesting role there.  I think there is also a growing discussion among opinion leaders in the field that the patients regain weight when they stop the injectable. And in general, they are only available for maybe a year. So an oral agent that could be taken for a longer period could also play a really interesting role to maintain body weight at a low level.  And finally, you're absolute right, the new data for this drug class suggests that patients could benefit from both cardiac and renal protection. And oral agents allow you to build combination with drugs that already are used in this population, such as the 52, to protect the heart etc. So I think that's why there is such a big interest in drugs in this class. We have, I think, more than 1,400 patients on danuglipron and it's a very safe drug. It's a very safe drug. And we look forward to the readout on efficacy, as we have said. before year-end. So that's very straightforward.  mRNA flu, you had a very good comment, particularly in initial studies, tolerability is really what we focus on. And tolerability was similar to standard of care available vaccines, or the other mRNA vaccines experienced from Pfizer. And we haven't really had any concerns about safety. So on both tolerability and safety, the statement stands that it looks like previous versions of our vaccines. On the once a day reformulated danu, we have initially tested a standard swellable core technology, and could show that it worked very well with danu. Now to be able also to incorporate a more sophisticated technology, we worked on a matrix technology, and all data suggests it's going to a really intriguing alternative because, as you know, in diabetes oral drugs and obesity, you will over time end up with incorporating different trials to prevent different downstream effects. And that's the beautiful of having these type of novel technology that you have a potential in the future to go to fix those combination. And we are really masters in developing sophisticated formulations and we will have this available in 2024. The near term goal is really look at the data, as we have said, both Albert and myself, and pending review, of course, there's an option with a once a day danu to move forward in obesity and diabetes.  I think we have commented that the upside with oral drugs are many in the sector. That's why it has been such a big interest. And that includes fixed dose combination, which aren't available with injectables. But we will keep it simple and clear. We'll review the data and take a decision about potential in obesity and diabetes once a day danu. That's the near term."

            "content": "Obviously, we remain very confident that we will close Seagen towards the end of this year, beginning next year. As you pointed out, there's a significant interest now in ADCs because of the potential that they could replace most of the chemotherapeutics in the future for most cancer types.  Seagen obviously has a significant track record with both the current approved ADCs from the laboratories and, as you've seen, three potential registration phase trials just read out and passed up to Kaiser [indiscernible] but also with the small molecule to Kaiser.  They recently started two Phase 3 studies, one with tisotumab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced metastatic, HER2 positive or HER2 low bladder cancer. This is a program that we're very excited about. Already tisotumab received previously breakthrough therapeutic innovation in the US. And they're also just about to start another Phase 3 program in non-small cell lung cancer with the B6A integrin beta-6 antibodies. So we remain very confident in their portfolio and the depth of expertise they're bringing to the development and discovery of ADCs. Thank you for raising 301. It's a truly monumental data for the field of bladder cancer, and urothelial cancer. And as you pointed out, with overall survival and median \u2013progression-free survival nearly double, moving median overall survival for this population now nearly towards three years, we expect the final data to be above \u2013 longer than 31.5 months. So this just reaffirms our belief that antibody drug conjugates could become a standard of care across the treatment paradigm for many, many different tumor types. That's a very good question. As you know, Seagen pioneered the MMAE auristatin-based payloads, and we see this potential synergy in combination with a PD-1 with [indiscernible]. Although Seagen does have the next generation of ADCs with topo 1 that will enter the clinic this year \u2013 next year, we don't know yet if the topo 1s are going to show the similar type of immunogenicity as what appears to happen with the MMAE auristatin based payloads. So I think we're very confident that Seagen has both topo 1 as well as auristatin based payloads in case with topo 1s we do not see what appears [indiscernible]."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Dave Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert. And good morning. Before I review this quarter's results, I will address a couple of topics that have been top of mind with investors since our announcement on October 13th. These topics relate to our future US government Paxlovid revenue forecasts, as well as our multi-year cost realignment program.  With respect to revenue recognition associated with the amended agreement, the US government is expected to return an estimated 7.9 million EUA-labeled treatment courses and, in return, will receive a volume-based credit at an approximate value of $4.2 billion at the end of 2023 for future treatment courses. Pfizer will also provide an additional 1 million treatment courses into the US strategic national stockpile.  As a result of all that, Pfizer has an obligation to deliver an estimated 8.9 million treatment courses for which we will record approximately $4.2 billion of revenue beginning in 2024 as we deliver treatment courses. It is important to note that there is no cash compensation for the estimated 8.9 million treatment courses delivered.  Regarding our cost realignment program, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve at least $3.5 billion of net cost savings by the end of 2024 versus the mid-point of our August 1, 2023 SI&A and R&D guidance. We expect $1 billion of targeted savings in 2023 and expect an additional savings of at least $2.5 billion in 2024. In a moment, when I review the components of our full-year 2023 guidance, you will see that we have lowered the midpoints of both our SI&A and R&D guidance ranges by $500 million, respectively.  Now, turning to the quarter, our Q3 results, both top and bottom line, were significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products. Revenues declined 41% operationally, the result of the decrease in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales, while adjusted diluted loss per share was also significantly impacted by $5.6 billion of non-cash inventory write-offs of COVID related inventories.  I want to emphasize, as Albert stated previously, that the operational revenue growth of our products in Q3, excluding both Paxlovid and Comirnaty were strong at 10%. Contributing to this strong performance was our newly approved RSV vaccine and the families of products associated with both Prevnar and Vyndaqel. Additionally, our recently acquired products, Nurtec and Oxbryta, also contributed to this strong growth.  Our reported diluted loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.17 in the quarter are primarily the result of the decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales and the non-cash charge related to write-offs of COVID-related inventories. The inventory write-off of $4.7 billion for Paxlovid and $900 million for Comirnaty negatively affected adjusted loss per share by $0.84.  Foreign exchange movements had a de minimis unfavorable impact on third quarter revenues and increased adjusted diluted loss per share by $0.04 or 2% compared to LY.  Now, let me briefly touch on our full-year guidance. Given we updated our full-year revenue and EPS guidance on October 13th, I am just going to hit a few of the highlights. Total company full-year 2023 revenues are expected to be in the range of $58 billion to $61 billion versus previous range of $67 billion to $70 billion. Importantly, we continue to expect 6% to 8% full- year operational revenue growth for non-COVID products year-over-year. As anticipated, the majority of this growth is occurring in the second half of the year, given the timing of new product and indicated launches.  I want to remind you that, beginning in Q4, we will overlap the acquisitions of Biohaven and GBT last year, which we completed on October of 2022.  Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43%, primarily the result of the $5.6 billion non-cash charge related to inventory write-offs for our COVID products.  Adjusted SI&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be within a range of $11.9 billion to $12.9 billion. The mid-points of both ranges are now $500 million lower than our original guidance.  As a result of all these, the company now expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 versus the original guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45. All additional components of our guidance are included in our press release that was issued earlier today.  As discussed in prior quarters, our capital strategy is based on three core pillars. First is reinvesting in our business. Second is growing our dividends over time. And third is making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested $7.9 billion in internal R&D, returned $6.9 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed Seagen acquisition.  Lastly, in addition to our completing a $31 billion unsecured debt offering in Q2 of this year, we are ready to execute the remaining short-term financing to complete the proposed Seagen acquisition upon fulfillment of the required closing conditions. We expect to de-lever our capital structure following the completion of this transaction, and as we de-lever, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases.  In closing, I want to reiterate that our product portfolio remains very strong. We continue to be encouraged by the momentum of our non-COVID products in Q3 and are committed to the successful execution of our new product and indication launches. We expect that the cost realignment program will improve our operating margins, enhancing long-term shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it over to Mikael. Obviously, it's a little over 2024. I would just say that, clearly, we had a clearing event as it relates to our COVID expectations for this year. So a lot of that risk is behind us as we think about the balance this year. I do expect that the balance of this year will be very informative, particularly in the US as we think about utilization trends, both for vaccination rates, importantly Paxlovid, here in the US that will allow us to have a better clarity as we cycle into 2024 of the utilization around those specific products, which will still be meaningful to us at an enterprise level.  Clearly, when we get to providing guidance, we'll give you a lot of information beneath that, so you can get a good sense of our \u2013 importantly, our non-COVID products which continue to trend very favorably and very well. And we can layer on, I'll say, the optionality associated with our COVID franchise as we cycle into next year.  So, obviously, a lot more to come. We're looking forward to sharing those very specific details after the first of the year. Chris, on the cost program, I would not read into the allocation of savings in 2023 as it relates to 2024. Obviously, we have a fairly robust program up and running today. We're working aggressively on those programs and beginning to implement those programs. As we cycle into 2024, we'll give you and the markets specific color on how to think about those cost savings as we wrap into next year. But I think what is important is that is if you look at our business, our core business is performing nicely. We continue to make traction. We have obviously a lot of launches that we've completed and still several ahead of us. We're excited about what Seagen could potentially bring to the company as we think about our focus now in oncology. And then importantly, I think we've rebaselined, if you will, the COVID franchises. Think about utilization in the back half of this year and cycle into next year. We will then take a step back and look at what would be prudent as we think about the revenue in totality of this company as we cycle into 2024 and beyond. So I think you look forward to, as we begin going into 2024, those expectation of laying those out specifically."

Just as a reminder, this was a Phase 2 program that required significant Phase 3 investment. And so we held on to a 25% stake. We also had rights to royalties on US sales, as well as the full ex-US and ex-Japan rights. And we did that all without any R&D spend. So Roche's proposed acquisition of Televant will give us access to about $1.75 billion of pretax cash, which is the translation of our stake, and we still retain all the other rights. So we're looking forward to having Roche as a partner. We're looking forward to the investments that they're going to make in advancing the clinical stage programs on TL1A and benefiting from the outcome of those."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Well, as you heard, during the HCIP discussions, our recommendation for ABRYSVO today is really one around shared clinical decision making. But we also were \u2013 we were asked to bring additional data when they are ready. And so, just to confirm that we will have additional data in vaccine effectiveness in broader populations, we will have safety data also in broader populations, we will also have immunogenicity data in younger populations. All of this will be, I think, available in the next year when we plan to bring this back to the CDC. In addition to that, actually omitted to mention that we'll also have second season efficacy data. So, we'll be able to bring this totality of data together to determine whether the recommendations will change, but also what the vaccination schedule will be. So that's to come in 2024. Yes, it's going to be available in pharmacies and doctors' offices and OBGYN offices. I think we have a real stocking advantage here, Louise, because anyone just needs to stock one product for two indications for both populations. So I think the uptake is to come. And certainly, the next few months, being that it's the winter, is when we begin to \u2013 we believe we'll see some good uptake. Thanks for the question, Chris, because it's a great opportunity for us to share that we are seeing Nurtec perform just as we expected. In fact, with some really strong performance indicators that I'd like to share with you.  First of all, from a TRx perspective, we grew 28% compared to last year this time, and sequentially, we grew 6% versus last quarter. In fact, on October 20, we saw the highest week of TRx's and NRxs to date.  That growth is also seen in the number of prescribers. Just this quarter alone, we had 73,000 prescribers writing Nurtec. And we are now moving at a clip of about 23,000 writer a week which is 30% more than Ubrelvy and double that of Qulipta.  Another good place to look is also in new to brand starts, right, NBRxs. And when you look at that, NBRx growth for Nurtec is higher than Ubrelvy and Qulipta in all the deciles of physicians, but particularly in the decile 8 to 10, which, as you know, is where the highest prescribers are or who are the highest prescribers.  And then, when you look at pill count, we see something interesting there too. We have been very intensely or intently driving our pill pack toward the larger pill pack size, which is the 16 pack because of our prevention indication. And so, when you look at the totality of all the pills or the total volume of pills, we have a leading market share there, more than 50%.  And so, I think when you look at all these indicators, at least from the way that we're looking at it, it's very positive story. It's exactly how we see it. The expansion into primary care, as you heard in Albert's comments, is what it is that we're after. And today, only 17% of the entire market is oral CGRPs, which tells you that most of the market is still an opportunity for us and represents growth that we're really, really looking forward to. And I think that we put the right investments in the right places to generate this growth in the future.  From a pricing perspective, obviously, it's a product that is rebated, and so I think the way to think about it is that, from a patient perspective, which is where we really put a lot of focus, we want to make sure that our patients are able to get the scripts, are able to get access for Nurtec, especially as you consider that we're trying to mobilize people away from Topiramate and away from triptans on to all CGRPs.  So the gross to net effects here are significant. And you see that quarter-over-quarter because we are making sure that we're able to provide access to patients who deserve and are eligible for [indiscernible]. I was just going to add to that that, competitively, we believe that we have an excellent efficacy and safety profile. We don't have a need to titrate up, as Mikael said. And also, our assessment of standard versus our competitors at the initiation of therapy. So I think that this is a level playing field that we're in. Certainly patient support is an area of focus for us, right, to ensure that patients are getting the assessments that they need. But we feel that we're \u2013 this is pretty standard practice and we'll be able to launch this product as planned. We're really pleased with our performance on ABRYSVO. It has exceeded our expectations. You first asked whether this is all about stocking. And I can say that it isn't. Of course, there was stocking effect in the beginning because this was a new vaccine. But we're also closely tracking vaccination rates and uptake. And what you see is that there is very fast uptake that really benefit from the fact that this was approved and in market prior to the vaccination season actually happening. So it was able to ride off the coattails of flu vaccinations, which you know are very high. Right? September, October. We have about a 70% co-administration rate. The performance we're seeing on ABRYSVO is truly driven by vaccinations. To your comment about market share, yes, we are seeing a similar market share to what you have just said. That is because, right now, the retail setting is driving a lot of the vaccinations. But don't forget that that's not where all vaccinations are taking place. We also have non-retail settings such as health systems, doctors' offices, those are also being engaged. And those particular settings, Pfizer actually has a leading preference. They are smaller in proportion, but still. So I think we have to look at all channels of the market.  Finally, I think that, just from a momentum perspective, we expect things to continue. The vaccinations really are happening throughout this time now \u2013 October, November, December are big vaccination months. From where we are right now, RSV is only 5% of the entire vaccination rate of the eligible populations. So I think that the conclusion is we're very early in the innings of this launch. It's doing better than we thought. But where we are going to be, I think, is a place where there's tremendous opportunity for driving uptake in older adults, but also maternal, which, as you know, we just got the approval for. We continue to feel confident about the peak sales. The reason is that, right now, we have the first set of recommendations, but the ACIP has also told us that we will have the opportunity again to come back next year when we have additional data, which is when we will have the opportunity to look at the schedule or how [indiscernible] are being \u2013 the schedule that they're being delivered today. And we'll have an opportunity again to take a look at the benefit of PENBRAYA in this population. So I feel like it's great that we have an opportunity to get out now and to begin vaccinating our teenagers. We'll have a second bite at the apple, which will allow us to achieve our peak sales."

And of course, my favorite, our forward-looking statements, please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on slide 3 and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on earnings release and our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call\u2019s original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. Non-COVID-19 revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. Total revenues declined 53% operationally, primarily due to the anticipated revenue declines in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Even with these declines, our COVID-19 portfolio remained a significant contributor to the business with more than $1.6 billion in combined revenues during this quarter. Of course, our patient impact data are equally important because patients are the reason we exist. Through the first six months of the year, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. We continue to make progress towards our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. In fact, Pfizer is more than halfway of its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in an 18-month span. In addition to the six approvals and five launches that occurred prior to 2023, we had six approvals and four launches in the first six months of 2023. For the second half of 2023, we expect six additional approvals and six additional launches, including the two launches that occurred in July. Then in 2024, we expect one approval and four launches, which, if approved and recommended, would raise the total to 19 new launches in approximately 18 months. As you can see in this chart, for this year\u2019s launches, we expect the revenue contribution to occur largely in the second half of 2023 because the first-half launches occurred late in the second quarter. And then in 2024, with the additional impact of next year\u2019s expected launches, we anticipate an even greater total contribution for our 19 launches. It\u2019s important to note that 18 of the 19 potential launches have been largely derisked from a technical perspective at this point, with the only one remaining being our RNA flu candidate. Equally encouraging is that our pipeline is expected to continue generating breakthrough treatments and vaccines long after the 19 we have been discussing. We recently reported milestones from several exciting pipeline candidates with the potential to be significant future value drivers. These include: Phase 3 data from marstacimab, a novel antibody being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A and B; regulatory filing acceptance for our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate; the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of Phase 2 results for our vaccine candidate for maternal immunization against Group B Streptococcus; and first-in-human data from our pipeline of potential next-generation breast cancer treatments, including our novel CDK4, CDK2, and KAT6 inhibitors. Now, I would like to provide some commentary on our COVID-19 portfolio. As you all know, during the pandemic, Pfizer demonstrated impressively the power of our research and manufacturing capabilities by bringing to the world the first and most widely used vaccine and oral treatment for COVID-19. These scientific breakthroughs have played a significant role in bringing the global health crisis under control, and we are very proud of our contributions. The profits these products have generated to date have enabled us to invest in acquiring Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics, which together we expect to contribute approximately $10 billion of revenues in 2030. In fact, the acquisitions of Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics are already contributing to our operational growth, while the acquisition of Arena is expected to start generating revenues toward the end of this year. We also remain very excited about our planned acquisition of Seagen, which, if approved, is expected to contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 revenues. As a result of the positive momentum of our non-COVID-19 revenues and, more importantly, the success of our COVID-19 portfolio, Pfizer\u2019s overall revenues have increased exponentially compared with our 2019 revenues, pro forma for the divestitures of Upjohn and our consumer business. This allowed us to increase investments in R&D and SI&A to support this new revenue base and our expected new product launches. The increased investments we are making in R&D and SI&A this year were sized based on certain revenue assumptions we made in January for both our COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 products. These assumptions also were incorporated in our 2023 financial guidance. Clearly, there is a higher level of uncertainty regarding the demand projections for our COVID-19 products than for the rest of the business. For example, in January, we shared our expectation that approximately 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines would be administered in the U.S. this year, of which we estimated Pfizer to capture 60% market share. In the first six months of 2023, 12.4 million doses were administered in the U.S. While the 12.4 million doses are behind our earlier projections, our market share for COVID-19 is ahead of our previous expectations at 65%. However, the vast majority of respiratory vaccinations happen during the fall and winter respiratory disease season, which starts in September, and we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to follow this pattern going forward. The uncertainty of the exact timing of Comirnaty commercialization was largely removed with the decision by the FDA and CDC to request a change in the composition of the vaccine to address the Omicron XBB 1.5 strain. We believe this will allow us to commercialize the vaccine in September, assuming the updated vaccines are approved and available by the end of August. In the European Union, the uncertainty regarding the vaccine\u2019s revenue contributions for 2023 and beyond was removed when we renegotiated successfully our long-term agreement. This agreement spreads the agreed volumes over four years, and while it puts pressure on this year\u2019s volumes, we believe it also provides longer-term revenue certainty in this important market. Similar to what we are experiencing with the vaccine, the second half of the year will play a bigger role in informing our expectations for the long-term demand for Paxlovid, the utilization of which follows very closely the COVID-19 infection rates. We expect a new COVID-19 wave to start in the U.S. this fall, and this expectation is supported by the increase in infection rates we are already seeing. Obviously, the severity of disease and people\u2019s desire for treatment also will be factors, as will the ongoing dialogue with the U.S. government regarding when we will transition to a commercial model for Paxlovid. These are the uncertainties. We are acutely aware that all these uncertainties are making it difficult to project the future revenues of Pfizer in this area and at large at Pfizer and also affecting our stock price, as a result. The good news is we will have much more clarity and certainty regarding how our COVID-19 products will perform in a commercial market, by the time we report our third-quarter financial results, and we expect the uncertainties to be largely eliminated by the end of the year. This is because we expect the vaccination and treatment rates from the upcoming respiratory disease season to be a reliable predictor of trends in subsequent years, with some potential upside of course, if a combination flu and COVID-19 vaccine is brought to market in the future. Additionally, by that point the timing of transitioning to full commercialization of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid should become clear. Despite this uncertainty, we will continue to invest in our COVID-19 portfolio this year in advance of the upcoming respiratory disease season. This is very important. But given the uncertainty, we are also preparing to have the ability to adjust our 2024 total cost base to align with various future COVID-19 revenue scenarios. In fact, we have already identified specific areas where we can make adjustments, primarily within our COVID-19 cost base, if demand comes in lower than expected. Dave will provide more details during his remarks. Next, I wanted to share a few quick updates of our planned acquisition of Seagen, which we believe will be a major driver of our future success. Seagen\u2019s shareholders recently overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition, and we have already raised most of the external financing needed to fund the transaction. We also continue to work closely with regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. In the meantime, our integration planning continues, which will allow us to hit the ground running following an anticipated close later in 2023 or early in 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Last week, we announced that Chris Boshoff has joined Pfizer\u2019s Executive Leadership Team as Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President, reporting directly to me. In this role, Chris will lead a new, end-to-end Oncology R&D organization and be the single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline, from discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development. This is similar to the structure we currently have in place for our Vaccines R&D organization, which has proven to be very productive. Pfizer and Seagen share a common vision to deliver life-saving treatments for people living with cancer, which is why I am so pleased that, after closing, Chris\u2019s Oncology leadership team will include talented, purpose-driven and highly productive leaders from both companies. And we made already announcements about the people that are joining Chris\u2019s leadership team. We believe this new structure will help further accelerate the delivery of cancer therapies, which is critical because in the battle against cancer, time is life. At Pfizer one of our core business principles is the belief that \u201cTrust is Everything.\u201d I\u2019m proud to share that in recent months, we have received some wonderful accolades that speak to the trust we are building with external stakeholders. We were named one of the 2023-2024 \u201cBest Companies to Work For\u201d by U.S. News & World Report. We were listed in Newsweek\u2019s list of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces 2023.\u201d For the third year in a row, Pfizer has earned a top 100 score in the 2023 \u201cDisability Equality Index.\u201d And our own Rady Johnson received the Disability:IN 2023 Executive Sponsor of the Year Award at the National Conference in July. Lastly, our PGS site in Ascoli, Italy is being recognized by the United Nations for the \u201cWelcome Award - Working for Refugee Integration.\u201d These recognitions are very important because they strengthen the unprecedented brand equity that Pfizer built during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before I hand it over to Dave, I want to quickly comment on the situation at our facility in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First, all of us at Pfizer were relieved that no colleagues were seriously injured when the tornado struck. That said, our facility sustained substantial damage, as did the neighborhoods where many of our colleagues live, unfortunately. The local leadership team has done an incredible job responding to this devastating event, and we are proceeding with both, urgency and caution to determine the best way to get the site back online as quickly as possible, so as to minimize any impact on patients. Of course, we are also aking steps to ensure the continued safety of our colleagues and contractors, which remains our top priority. And with that, I will turn it over to Dave. And after Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave?\nDave Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 24 months, Pfizer has made important investments to position it squarely on track to achieve profitable and sustainable growth particulary in the back half of this decade. We have strategically invested to expand our commercial portfolio and our late-stage pipeline, strengthen our market launch capabilities, and enhanced innovation through internal R&D and business development actions. These deliberate efforts continue to solidify Pfizer\u2019s ability to overcome upcoming LOEs and drive sustainable revenue growth all while enhancing long-term shareholder value. To further support our long-term growth objectives, we are executing a capital allocation strategy designed to effectively deploy our cash. Our strategy is focused on three main pillars: first is reinvesting in our business; second is growing our dividends over time; and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first half of 2023 alone, we\u2019ve invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D; returned $4.6 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed acquisition of Seagen. During the second quarter, Pfizer successfully completed a $31 billion unsecured debt offering across 8 tranches. The net proceeds of this debt offering will be used to substantially fund the Seagen acquisition. The new debt carries a weighted average yield of 4.93% and a weighted average maturity of 16.3 years, consistent with our expectations. On a full year run rate basis, the annual financing cost associated with the acquisition is expected to be nearly $2 billion. With the completion now of this debt offering, the company is now positioned to close the Seagen acquisition immediately upon post regulatory approvals. While we plan to continue investing in our business, we expect to de-lever our capital structure following the closing of Seagen transaction. As we de-lever it is our expectation to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy inclusive of share repurchases. Now, with that, let me briefly cover a few highlights of our quarterly financial performance. As Albert said, our Q2 results were solid and in line with our expectations from both a top and bottom-line perspective, albeit slightly better than EPS consensus. As expected in our guidance, our overall Q2 revenues declined 53% operationally. The contraction of revenues was driven by the anticipated decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales. We expect these products to transition to a commercial market in the second half of this year. Our operational revenue growth excluding our COVID products was in line with expectations at 5% versus Q2 of LY, with strong contributions from the inclusion of Nurtec and Oxbryta, as well as the continued growth from the Vyndaqel family. During Q2, adjusted SI&A expenses were $3.4 billion and grew 20% operationally versus LY. We continue to invest in support of our upcoming launches and grow our recently acquired products. While it\u2019s clear that these near-term investments are dampening our current profitability levels, we are laser-focused on maximizing the longer-term performance of these products. Now, moving to the bottom line, reported diluted EPS this quarter declined by 77% to $0.41, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 declined 65% on an operational basis. Earnings compressed at a greater rate than revenues, primarily due to the steep and anticipated contraction in Paxlovid sales during the quarter. Once again, foreign exchange movements continued to unfavorably impact our results, reducing second quarter revenues by approximately $280 million, or 1%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05, or 2%, compared to last year. Now that we are at the halfway point of our 2023 financial plan, I\u2019d like to take a moment to reflect on how we are executing across our business while navigating within an incredibly unique and dynamic environment. As a management team, we remain committed to transparency and sharing our assessment of the evolving marketplace given the magnitude of launches; the ongoing shifting nature of the COVID landscape; and the continued integration of acquired assets. Let me begin by elaborating on our full-year 2023 financial guidance. We are narrowing our expectations for revenues to between $67 billion to $70 billion and maintaining guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45 for the full year. For our more durable and predictable non-COVID revenues, we are updating our guidance range to 6% to 8% operational revenue growth. From a launch timing standpoint, I\u2019ll point out that the majority of our 2023 launches are anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 and our commercialization schedule remains materially unchanged. As a company, we always strive to achieve the highest revenue level possible while maintaining a realistic view of key inputs that inform our outlook. Regarding RSV for older adults, the shared decision-making recommendation by ACIP is likely to slow its uptake in the U.S. In addition, the recent approval of Talzenna in the U.S. results in a more narrow patient population than originally planned. These factors coupled with the impact of the damaged Rocky Mount manufacturing facility presents near-term revenue challenges. However, we expect positive revenue momentum as we exit 2023 and head into 2024. Importantly, the long-term outlook for our non-COVID business remains intact relative to our 2030 ambitions. Turning now to our less predictable and more variable COVID portfolio. Year-to-date we have booked slightly over 40% of the $21.5 billion full-year revenue forecast for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid with the important fall vaccination and respiratory infection season ahead of us. We are acutely aware that COVID demand depends on many evolving market variables making the range of potential revenue outcomes increasingly large and difficult to predict with certainty. These variables include overall levels of vaccination and infection rates; the speed of draw-down of government inventory levels; and the mutating nature of the virus itself, just to name a few. In the interest of public health and with the important fall season ahead of us, we are maintaining our COVID revenue outlook for the year while continuing to invest, largely on a variable expense basis, to support our COVID products in 2023. These variable investments are important to support our efforts to reach as many patients as possible, helping to ensure the most at-risk individuals are both vaccinated and treated while maintaining our leading market share. We are proud of what we have achieved through the COVID portfolio, and this has allowed the Company to invest in support of its growth agenda for the back half of this decade. Our visibility into future COVID revenues and demands should improve through the remainder of 2023, as we gain clarity on a more typical annual revenue run-rate. We are well aware that our 2023 profit outlook is currently being dampened by incremental costs in support of our launches, as well as higher R&D investments aligned with the Company\u2019s current revenue base. We remain committed to both defending and growing our overall level of profitability. As Albert mentioned earlier, we expect this fall\u2019s performance of our COVID-19 products to help us more effectively forecast future sales performance. To that end, if our COVID-19 revenues are less than what we have assumed, we are prepared to launch an enterprise-wide cost improvement program aligned with the longer-term revenue projections for our business. This program would be designed to support our objective of growing our operating profit margin and we would expect it to begin to yield results in 2024. We look forward to sharing specific details of this program in our upcoming earnings calls. In closing, this is an extraordinary time for Pfizer. Our confidence and our commitment to our strategy and to achieving our 2030 goals is unwavering. We will continue to focus our efforts to drive growth while enhancing long-term shareholder value. And with that, let me now turn it over to Mikael.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Thank you, Dave. Today, I will provide updates from a few different therapeutic focus areas, starting with breast cancer. We are working to deliver the next wave of innovative therapies for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The pillars of this strategy are three-fold: establishing our investigational CDK4 inhibitor as a next-generation cell cycle therapy backbone, establishing vepdegestrant as a next-generation endocrine therapy backbone and establishing novel mechanisms like our investigational CDK2 inhibitor and KAT6 inhibitor candidates as next-gen combination partners to enhance efficacy. Our clinical strategy entails first developing assets for the metastatic setting in which Ibrance is currently the leader and unmet need is high, followed by an opportunity to expand to earlier-stage breast cancer including the CDK4/6-na\u00efve population and adjuvant/neoadjuvant settings. Data presented at ASCO from three key investigational medicines from our next-gen portfolio demonstrated anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated populations of patients with breast cancer. As a reminder, the majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia which requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition. Across the CDK4/6 inhibitor class, approximately 30% to 60% of patients experience severe neutropenia. On the left: In a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER 2-negative breast cancer, all of whom had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, treatment with our CDK4 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 29%, clinical benefit response rate of 52% and median progression free survival of nearly 25 weeks. The combination was well-tolerated, which may enable maximal CDK4 inhibition. We are actively planning the Phase 3 randomized study. In addition, I\u2019d like to highlight encouraging data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study of our novel CDK2 inhibitor which showed monotherapy activity, including confirmed partial responses, in breast cancer patients who had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Also, durable confirmed clinical responses were observed in a Phase 1 trial of our novel KAT6 inhibitor as a monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer. Turning now to blood cancers, Elrexfio, also known as elranatamab, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be the anchor of an anticipated multi-billion-dollar franchise. An FDA decision for the potential first indication in the triple-class relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population is expected this year, and we continue to advance the MagnetisMM clinical programs to expand into earlier lines of treatment. In addition, the development of maplirpacept, also known as TTI-622, is underway, including in combination with Elrexfio, to support potential indications in myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we show Elrexfio data presented at EHA from the MagnetisMM-3 trial in patients with triple-class refractory multiple myeloma who had no prior exposure to BCMA-directed therapy. On the left, we observed highly meaningful survival with Elrexfio monotherapy, with a 15-month overall survival of 57%. In patients who achieved a complete response, 15-month survival was remarkably 93%, underscoring the potential for deep and durable responses. We can see evidence of broad activity in multiple myeloma on the right, with the graph showing a single agent complete response rate of 35%, which rises to 46% in the subset of patients with two to three prior lines of therapy. Our ongoing randomized trials are in less pretreated to newly diagnosed populations. Subject to approval, Elrexfio may have key differentiators such as 50% lower hospitalization time during the step-up dosing period per protocol and an extended dosing interval that moves from once weekly to once every other week dosing beyond week 24. Turning now to hemophilia A and B, the pivotal trial of marstacimab met its primary endpoints, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on annualized bleeding rate, or ABR. There was a 35% reduction in ABR compared to prophylactic factor replacement and 92% reduction in ABR versus ondemand factor replacement. Marstacimab offers a differentiated mechanism of action and dosing regimen compared to standard-of-care therapy. If approved, it has the potential to be the first once-weekly subcutaneous hemophilia B treatment for patients without inhibitors, and the first hemophilia A or B treatment administered in a patient-friendly pen as a flat dose. Regulatory submission is expected in the second half of 2023. Next, Litfulo, also known as ritlecitinib, is the first medicine to receive FDA approval to treat severe alopecia areata in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It also recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s CHMP recommending body but is not yet approved. It has the potential to redefine the standard of care for alopecia areata. Litfulo is a first-of-its-kind kinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism that inhibits both the TEC kinase family and transiently JAK3, pathways that have been implicated in the alopecia areata pathophysiology. In addition, we are exploring how its unique mechanism of action could potentially be applied across immune disorders including vitiligo, in which a Phase 3 study is ongoing, and other potential indications. Finally, we are making excellent progress on the milestones we had set out through the first half of 2024. As Albert noted, we recently received FDA approval for Prevnar 20 in the pediatric population. We have robust strategies in place to potentially improve the protection provided by current pneumococcal vaccines. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters. In addition, we recently published Phase 2 data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing our Group B Streptococcus maternal vaccine candidate was generally well-tolerated and generated robust antibody levels. The journal also published a natural history study which was used to determine protective antibody levels at birth. These two studies indicated that the vaccine candidate may offer meaningful protection to infants born to immunized mothers. We were highly encouraged that Dr. Carol Baker, an infectious disease expert from the University of Texas Health Science Center, wrote an independent NEJM editorial highlighting the important future prospects of our GBS vaccine candidate. The progress of the GBS vaccine candidate dovetails nicely with the positive results and anticipated upcoming regulatory decisions for our RSV vaccine Abrysvo for administration to pregnant women. Abrysvo recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s CHMP for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. Abrysvo is approved for older adults in the U.S. and under regulatory review for the maternal indication. In addition, we remain excited to see Phase 2 data from danuglipron by end of 2023, which we expect will enable us to finalize our Phase 3 plans. Finally, I\u2019ll call out the Phase 3 trial start of our anti-interferon Beta candidate for the treatment of inflammatory muscle myopathies, which has received a Fast Track Designation from FDA. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Mikael. Chelsea, if you could please queue up the callers. We have at least 30 minutes for our Q&A session now.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nNicole Germino: This is Nicole on for Robyn. So just a quick question first. Can you -- on RSV, can you share what you expect the share decision making to slow the uptake in the U.S. would be? What we want to know if they can elaborate -- if you guys can elaborate on why you think this is the case the peak in annual sales is slower than previously expected? And how do you think ex-U.S. sales might be impacted if at all, given the ACIP decision.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Maybe Angela can answer that. The question was, do you expect the share decision to have a big impact on RSV and also do we expect in the U.S. and also do we expect any impact, excluding the U.S.?\nAngela Hwang: Sure. So first of all, we\u2019re really excited about the approval for our RSV older adult vaccine. And the way I would see this shared clinical decision-making is just that it is a step towards the full routine recommendation that we anticipate, so. And I think that there is -- the way to look at it is that it\u2019s a short-term effect. We do expect that with more data that will emerge -- be emerging out of our clinical program, that we\u2019ll have an additional opportunity to go back to the ACIP and actually get the routine recommendation that we hope for. So, over the next year or so, as we collect and finalize our data, that is really the anticipation of it. So, it doesn\u2019t change the full opportunity for this particular vaccine. It doesn\u2019t change the peak. It just means that it takes us a little bit longer to get to the peak because of the shared clinical decision-making that -- that extra step that we have to take right now.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And what about the ex-U.S.?\nAngela Hwang: Ex-U.S., actually, we had a different filing. We were able to get both maternal and older adult at the same time. So I think you see slightly different dynamics there and that here in the U.S., our maternal vaccine will be launching later. But in ex-U.S. and in Europe, they will be launching at the same time. And those vaccine technical committees have not opined yet on those recommendations, in particular in terms of the utilization. And so, we\u2019ll await that. But I think what you have that\u2019s different and that\u2019s really a great upside is the fact that we have both indications at once.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, Angela. I hope we gave what you asked, Robyn. Operator, the next question please.\nOperator: Next, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I know I heard two different things on the cost cut just now. One was that it would be enterprise-wide, while Albert, I think, used the word within the COVID cost base. So I was just trying to reconcile the two. And also on danuglipron, is it reasonable to expect that if it\u2019s below mid-teens weight loss, you wouldn\u2019t move forward?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Let me clarify. Of course, it would be enterprise-wide, but what I said is that the COVID part is going to be the biggest one. Right now, you need to know that R&D and SI&A cost of COVID is billions, it\u2019s not a small amount. So, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot over there. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the prospects to move ahead at danu?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Well, we really look forward to get the data. And as you know, we have in parallel developed activities also for modified leads. I think we really need to look at the totality of data, its performance on important metabolic parameters in diabetes, its ability to deliver weight loss as you alluded to, and also, of course, its tolerability in general. These three implicate how well the drug can perform. And I remain optimistic that oral drugs in this class can have a profound effect on weight loss. Of course, one needs to be maybe a little bit caution to drive weight loss too far, as you have seen also some concerns in public media about side effects that may arise from that. So we will really integrate all of that data and make a decision, and we really look forward to that moment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO.\nEvan Seigerman: Kind of a follow-up from Umer\u2019s, I want to focus on the GLP-1 franchise. Can you talk about the competitive profile of danuglipron in its current form, considering safety, twice-daily dosing and efficacy? And maybe remind us on the time lines to potentially get more on a once-daily formulation of this asset?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Mikael?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, we expect data at the later part of this year. We are absolutely encouraged and confident that it has a different profile when it comes to adverse events as the danuglipron that we sold. So we don\u2019t see that as an issue. And I spoke to that we will put together the totality of data to pending readout, prepare a potential Phase 3 program. And it\u2019s a very big sector, diabetes and obesity. We have considerable expertise in treating cardiometabolic patients. So, we look forward to share more data and more plans with you as we move to further quarter. Thank you for your great interest in this important space.\nOperator: Next, we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two for me. Dave, I was just wondering how we should think about steady-state operating margin here. Looking back pre-COVID, the Company was around mid- to high-30% range. So, is that how we should think about this when you gave us some of the parameters but just maybe how to think about steady state? And then, on the messenger RNA Phase 3 seasonal flu vaccine program, it looks like that trial was upsized based on clinicaltrials.gov. So just wondering, Mikael, if you can talk through timing of data and help frame expectations there. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Terence. Let\u2019s start with Dave\nDave Denton: Yes. So, great question. As we think about our operating margin long term, clearly, our objective is to expand that over time. Clearly, it is our expectation to get back to, at a minimum, pre-COVID levels with one caveat is that we -- as we go forward, we do have a different mix of products within our portfolio, particularly the vaccine related to COVID. As you know that the vaccine, given the cost share that we have or profit share that we have with our partner, does dilute that product from an operating margin perspective. So a mix adjusted, you should see us back to those levels over time. But obviously, as we cycle into \u201824, we\u2019ll give you a lot more clarity on all the puts and takes as we integrate Seagen, as we roll forward from a COVID franchise perspective, how that looks as well as all the developments that we have coming out the pipeline at this point in time.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, David. Mikael mRNA flu.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. First, the totality of experience we have with mRNA for flu makes me very encouraged that this will be new modality as it was for COVID but now for flu, that engages two mechanisms, the B-cells and the T-cell that we should aspire for, having better efficacy than what we have seen with the old flu. We are continuing with the study because we just wanted to have more events and particularly have additional flu B type of events, which were scarce in the U.S. part of the trial. And we look forward to update you, hopefully, be able to conclude the study later this year. But we also are putting mitigations as adding immunogenicity studies that can be supplementary for getting a total good data package of activity against flu A and flu B. But as I said, I remain very optimistic that the mRNA is going to be the next important platform to deal with flu.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Two questions, if I may. On the potential enterprise-wide cost program, you would have some opportunity outside of the COVID programs to consider. Can you help us with the relative weighting potentially of R&D versus SG&A or some other component of that? And I ask that in part because you\u2019ve announced some changes, for instance, in kind of the structure at the top tier of management of the R&D with the anticipation of the oncology in Seattle Genetics. And then secondly, if I could, on the Rocky Mount facility, it\u2019s reassuring to hear in terms of your own staff. But I think folks are looking to get a sense for the scale of the damage and perhaps what potential gating factors for getting more information on the timing? I know that you guys have communicated with some of your hospital-based customers, but any additional insights in terms of magnitude of the impact and timing of the recovery, and what that could look like from a progress standpoint would be helpful.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Let me say a few words about the Rocky Mount, and then I\u2019ll ask Dave to answer the question about the cost adjustment program in case we have a significant reduction on our revenues because of the COVID. The Rocky Mount, it was severe, the damage of the hurricane, but the damage was mainly concentrated on the warehouse, which means that we lost a lot of inventory that was about to be sent to the markets. The facilities per se, the production facilities were not impacted by the hurricane. So, the buildings are standing there. However, because the utilities were discontinued, the facilities had to stop operating. And in this highly sensitive, sterile environment, when you are losing power, it\u2019s not easy to switch on and switch off. It takes time and a lot of processes so that you can start. And the additional challenge will be some of the inventories of materials that were also destroyed, particularly glass and other stuff. We need to make sure that we will replace in time. So, what I want to say is that we feel very confident that the whole thing will go back to life. But still, we are assessing how long that will take. And we are doing anything we can to make sure that we will minimize the shortages in the marketplace because of that. Now, let\u2019s move to some more color on the cost adjustment program.\nDave Denton: Yes. So, thank you for the question. Clearly, as we develop this program in the back half of \u201823, we look forward to sharing a lot more details as we cycle into \u201824 and give you a lot of, I\u2019ll say, milestones as you think about both our cost and investment structure going forward. Importantly, as you know, we\u2019re extremely excited about the Seagen acquisition that\u2019s upcoming here. Upon approval, this will allow the Company to refocus its efforts and its investments to make sure that we\u2019re squarely focused on battling cancer going forward. And we think there\u2019s a big opportunity as we align our resources against that franchise in that battle to fight cancer and an opportunity for patients and importantly, an opportunity long term for Pfizer. Having said that, we will be informed in the back half of the year of our revenue performance, specifically as it relates to COVID. That will inform us the level of opportunity we have to expand our margins into \u201824 and \u201825 and beyond. That will allow us to step back and make sure that all of our costs, all our investments are aligned with those Seagen objectives as well as aligned to maximizing the performance of our in-line portfolio as well as the launches that are occurring as we speak in the back half of this year. So, again, we look forward to sharing a lot more to this from this. This will be balanced, as you well know between SI&A and R&D, and we\u2019ll give you that specific breakdown and that specific information later this year and into next year.\nOperator: Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: I wanted to ask you first on these COVID scenarios that you think could unfold in the second half \u201823. Any way you could share some of the big ones that you anticipate could potentially happen? And then, secondly, seeing a lot of headlines in the ATTR-CM space. I\u2019m just curious if you anticipate any potential competition or meaningful competition to Vyndaqel and Vyndamax.\nDr. Albert Bourla: All right. So, on the COVID, I will say a few words and then I will ask Angela to comment on both. Look, the COVID scenario, it depends what are the uncertainties? I think I articulated. Let\u2019s start with the vaccine. The biggest uncertainty is vaccination rates. I think market share is pretty much, I think, well established. Vaccination rate is what we are going to see in the fall that is coming. So, that will be a big uncertainty. Another uncertainty was the time of commercialization in the U.S. because, of course, you go with new inventories, new sales to the market and with higher prices. That has been resolved. We know that it\u2019s very likely that we launch in September because FDA and CDC, they asked us to change the inventories basically by creating a new vaccine. So, that will happen. And also, the other uncertainty that existed about the COVID vaccine was the European contract. That was a very long -- very big contract. And now we have the certainty that it has been negotiated, a little bit less for the year because it\u2019s spread over four years, but let\u2019s say, renegotiated. So all of that are -- the key, of course, there is how much the Japan, Latin America and other countries will purchase, it\u2019s not the only ones, but let\u2019s say, those are the fundamentals. And we will know pretty much the trend in the third quarter. And we will know pretty much quite accurate what is the situation in the end of the year, but I think will be a very good predictor of what we should expect going forward with the only upside if we have a combined vaccine with flu or with RSV, that will increase the vaccination rate. On Paxlovid, a little bit more uncertainty because, of course, we are having the uncertainty of treatment rates and infection rates. And we don\u2019t know how that behaves. We don\u2019t have any benchmark to see how that goes. We know that the treatment rates are following very close the infection rates, and the infection rates are rising right now, but that remains to be seen how that will go. Of course, also the sales of Paxlovid are rising as we see in the market, the scripts on a weekly basis as always do when the infection rates are going up. But we have some more uncertainty, which is the timing of launch, which will depend on how we will agree for the interest of public health to transition this launch with the U.S. government. So, all of that remains to be seen. And these are the scenarios that we see for COVID. And the key message is the uncertainty will go away at the end of the year. We will know what COVID will contribute on a stable basis in Pfizer\u2019s revenue and we will go from there. Now, Angela, maybe if you want anything to add to that and also about the next question -- the other question.\nAngela Hwang: Louise, I think when you talk about Vyndamax or Vyndaqel, the biggest and our biggest differentiator that we\u2019re extremely confident about is just the totality of our data really along four dimensions. And whether that\u2019s clinical data or real-world data, we have all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalization data. Our data is also relevant in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM, so that\u2019s unique. We\u2019ve also demonstrated significant survival benefit at five years through our real-world data. So whichever way you look at it and you compare that with any competitor program, I think that we have a highly differentiated and an extremely valuable molecule that stacks up well against any competition.\nOperator: Next, we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe a follow-up to this one a little bit. So, thank you for all the transparency by the way. So, is it fair to say that in COVID trends that you have seen so far, at least sales trend that has been below your expectations, and you want to see one more quarter before you adjust expectations. I\u2019m asking this because if I look at the -- it seems like you still expect 88 million or so vaccinations in the second half of the year in the U.S. and the number was actually, by our calculation, 44 million or so in terms of administration, 111 million in terms of shipments. So, just trying to understand, is it like -- is it something where you are -- where we could get better update in third quarter on the COVID numbers? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is yes, we should get way better feeling. It\u2019s not that we just want to see another quarter. We want to see the big quarter of good respiratory season. COVID, we always said and everybody, I think, thinks that that is a common sense that will follow going forward the seasonality of the other respiratory vaccines, thus becoming more and more and more clear, right? And the majority of these vaccinations are happening in the third and fourth quarter for the year. So it\u2019s not that we are just another quarter. We\u2019re awaiting the main quarter. If COVID vaccinations go anywhere close to the flu vaccination rates, then we have a very big bit of what we expect to have. If they are a small fraction of what will happen for flu, then of course, we have a mix. So, that\u2019s why we are going to see how that will evolve. So it\u2019s a very, very important quarter. The rest, although for the first half of the year, we have quite significant contribution towards the total growth. So, we don\u2019t need -- not much of inventory if we get the utilization over there to make sure that we know how big the COVID franchise will become. And as I said, in the EU, we have adjusted very well. We will have high certainty, Paxlovid also. It\u2019s a very, very good market. We don\u2019t know how in the next wave the Paxlovid will be used. We have the rest of the world, but the inventories, they were also last year. So we are now expecting that products will start being going -- other expiring or product will start more reordering from many more countries. So that\u2019s why the infection rates on the Paxlovid will be extremely, extremely important. And all of that are happening now. So, once we know them, we can predict way more accurate. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we have Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse.\nTrung Huynh: You commented the long-term outlook for your non-COVID business remains intact relative to the 2030 ambitions. How are you thinking about the midterm 2025 guide because if you assume the midpoint of your ex-COVID \u201823 guide at 7%, in order to achieve the 6% 2020 to 2025 guidance ex-COVID, on our calculations, you need to do high single-digit growth for that base business for \u201824 and \u201825. That looks tough especially as you\u2019ll have more LOEs. So, do you remain confident in that midterm guide?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. Thank you. The LOEs are coming basically from year \u201826, right? So, all the way to \u201825, I think the impact will not be that high. Also, the guidance that we gave was 6%, yes, we feel quite confident that we will be there. So, we\u2019ll continue and we are at 6% right now all these years, right, year-to-date. So yes, the non-COVID business, I think, clearly, the success of the launches is very important. So we\u2019ll see a lot of things coming ahead of us. But it is a way better predictable. And I think we are there. So, I don\u2019t think there will be any variability.\nOperator: Next, we have Colin Bristow with UBS.\nColin Bristow: Another follow-up on danuglipron. I don\u2019t think I heard the answer in terms of when we\u2019ll hear about the once-daily formulation. And I\u2019d just like to understand your level of confidence here that you can make this a once-daily formulation without negatively impacting the AE profile, presumably given an increase in Cmax? And then more broadly, can you just talk more about how you\u2019re going to compete here, given I think it was previously referenced you\u2019re behind the competition, the clinical differentiation, the potentially less convenient dosing and essentially a therapeutic category in which you don\u2019t have a major presence. And then just maybe one other quick one on the pipeline item on DMD gene therapy, it\u2019s a late-stage asset that doesn\u2019t seem to get much air time. Is your enthusiasm waning on this program or is it just that others are sort of a bigger priority?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. Thank you. So, Mikael, again, clearly the obesity market and the size of it is creating a lot of interest in danuglipron. And so the question was about the one day formulation. And then also tell us a little bit about where we are with DMD.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: I hear your interest in a once-daily product, and I would say I don\u2019t see any technical barrier for us in creating that. We have tremendous experience in modified release formulations. And our early data, as we now have initiated a while ago, tells us we should be encouraged that when it relates to once-a-day modified release for danuglipron, I believe we will have such a formulation in a reasonable future in our hands. When could it come to the market if the drug continues and makes a great Phase 3? Well, I think we can have it at launch or shortly after launch. So I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. But I agree with you that once-daily modified release can sometimes actually improve the tolerability profile by a slew than the variability and exposure, which typically reduce GI side effects that have been seen as limiting this drug. So that\u2019s why I can see a potential twofold advantage of MR goes from twice a day to once a day and may also help uniquely to create a tolerability profile within the structure of GLPs. [Ph] DMD gene therapy, I\u2019m encouraged that FDA took a very positive angle on that drug when it comes to its urgency to get into the market. Chris, you and I have worked very closely on that, and we expect today we\u2019ll look relatively soon to conclude the trial. I\u2019ll also ask Chris to pitch in on it.\nDr. Chris Boshoff: Thank you, Mikael. So the DMD program is obviously very important for us, not just for the importance of gene therapy but for patients and families with this absolutely devastating disease. And we do have an interim analysis later this year for the CIFFREO trial. The CIFFREO trial, all patients have now been enrolled in the study. The interim analysis will be based not on a surrogate biomarker end point but on truly functional end point. So, we believe that\u2019s the best way to measure the benefit of gene therapy in this disease is with a functional end point. And that should come later this year, and we\u2019ll update you with the final analysis for the study then in 2024.\nDr. Albert Bourla: That was terrific. I just wanted to add that we have, like you heard Sarepta, ample biomarker that look very robust in our hand. But as Chris said, we want to provide patients with even more experience about the potential benefit.\nOperator: Next, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: A couple of questions [Technical Difficulty] savings. It\u2019s clear that demand for your COVID assets will influence whether or not you go down this route. But given the potential you\u2019ve highlighted previously for a COVID flu combination vaccine, I\u2019m interested to understand whether the upcoming Phase 3 data from your mRNA flu vaccine trial will influence your decisions on that cost saving program in any way. And then, secondly, on hemophilia, your anti-TFPI filing second half of the year for non-inhibitor patients. Should we assume you would seek to launch in that patient group only next year, or would you wait for the data in the inhibitor patient group before you proceed to market? And perhaps you can just discuss how big an opportunity you see in that drug.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Let me start with the COVID and then Mikael also can comment. But for example, we are very excited about the combinations, right? And the combinations will be flu and COVID and then hopefully also flu, COVID and RSV. And we are working on that. And we believe actually that the fact that if we have a combination with the non-mRNA included over there, we\u2019ll have likely that we expect to have the benefit of better safety profile because we don\u2019t have to load three products RNA into a single injection, but we will be using only two, COVID and flu, and then we\u2019ll use the protein-based vaccine, which has very -- profile in RSVs. All of that are working very well. Now, the question is what will happen if the COVID market is seen to be very -- as monovalent as very, very low. I think that will play a key role in our decision about controlling the cost. Because if it is very, very low, although we expect an upside in the combination, we will assume at this stage that the medical need for COVID is not that high. And as a result, we will reduce our investments in the area and also will temper our expectations for sales. And then if the combinations come and we are way more successful, that\u2019s a different story. You want also -- what was your second question? Yes, about marstacimab, Mikael?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: I\u2019m very excited about marstacimab. I followed this projects for a long time. And as you know, we reported our very encouraging data. We had 92% reduction in annual bleeding rate versus on demand. We had really no safety events as had been associated with other products, including Hemlibra. It\u2019s active against both in A and B. It\u2019s administrated with a pre-fill pen. I think it can be, from a medical point of view, a very large product, a single option for hemophilia A and B. Of course, when I think about how Hemlibra has been such a promise for in A patient and I see this profile that it\u2019s so good, I\u2019m optimistic that it can do well in both segments.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please. And we are a little bit -- the time is flying, so a lot of interest. So let\u2019s try to be more -- 1 question, please, each one.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Just had two real quick ones. Angela, on Prevnar, what does long-term growth look like? Clearly, you may have a tougher competitive environment. Just if you lose share, what do you think the TAM growth could look like to offset that? And then, Mikael, you talked a little bit about next-gen CDK. I know it\u2019s super early in development. But is there a risk-benefit hurdle you have in mind? I\u2019m just thinking about cost benefit post the Ibrance LOE and also considering the competitive landscape.\nDr. Albert Bourla: So Angela, how concerned you are with the competitive environment? I know with respect to our competitors, but we have some realities that maybe you want to discuss. And also, I would like actually Chris Boshoff to answer the question of CDK4 since we have him here in his new capacity. Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Well, I mean, I want to begin by just saying how I\u2019m incredibly proud we are of the performance of the entire Prevnar franchise. If you look at the adult indication, we have grown -- not only have we grown 23% since last year this time, we are doing all of this growth prior to the fall vaccination season, which is what you typically see. So the fact that we\u2019ve been able to bring these vaccinations will tell us a lot about the work that we\u2019ve done in pneumococcal disease, how well appreciated it is, but also how well our machinery is working, not to mention the fact that we have 96% share of the adult indication. In peds also, of course, being that we went from 100% of the market, today, we share some of that market share with PCV15. But I just want to remind everyone that that is to be expected, and we are exactly where we thought we would be. And so from that perspective, we\u2019re also really proud of how Prevnar 13 has competed with PCV15. I think the important thing here to realize is that given the ACIP recommendation that we\u2019ve just got for Prevnar peds what we are beginning to see now is a sort of reversal of that decline and the reclaiming of market share. And so, we have -- the fact that we\u2019ve seen some accounts purchasing PCV20 peds now, we\u2019ve seen some account switching from PCV15 to our own Prevnar 20, the fact that our federal contracts had added Prevnar 20 to their register, which means that public vaccinations can begin. And then maybe the one thing I will mention about Prevnar peds, which is unique compared to any other pneumococcal vaccine, which is that we were given the recommendations to vaccinate -- well, kids 2 to 18 immunocompromised. So that is a whole new population that we\u2019ve never had before. So, when you kind of bring all of this together and you factor that this quarter alone, Prevnar franchise generated $1.3 billion in revenue, just this one quarter, I think that order of magnitude gives you a sense of the scale and the competitiveness of our portfolio, and we\u2019re really excited about what Prevnar can do over the next coming quarters.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And that is under the competition of PCV15, which I think was around 150 million, if I\u2019m not mistaken. Chris, can you please speak about the CDK4 and the franchise in general over there?\nDr. Chris Boshoff: Thank you for the question. So, as you know, ER-positive breast cancer is the most common cancer globally for women, and we were very proud that we can build on our leadership in cell cycle inhibition with Ibrance, and with 3 first-in-class potential assets, CDK4-specific inhibitor, CDK2-specific inhibitor and a KAT6-specific inhibitor, all through the significant potential to transform treatment in the future for ER-positive breast cancer. For CDK4, we have seen more complete and continuous CDK4 target coverage and potentially improved tolerability due to reduced CDK6 inhibition. And as Mikael has pointed out, CDK6 leads to the hematological vulnerability. We know that epithelial cell specifically highly expressed CDK4, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to specifically target CDK4. And what we\u2019ve seen, as Mikael has pointed out, is Grade 3 neutropenia are 15% of our CDK4 inhibitor, and that\u2019s versus 60% as expected with other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We\u2019ve also not noted any Grade 3 diarrhea. And again, that\u2019s very different from what you know from some of the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We\u2019re accelerating our registration strategy with the first study in second-line post CDK4/6, where we\u2019ve recently shown 30% overall response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and we\u2019re also starting populations with CDK4 plus CDK2 as well as CDK4 with our potential next-generation backbone, ARV-471 or vepdegestrant, which we are codeveloping with Arvinas.\nOperator: Next, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: If I could go back to the COVID guidance, investors have been cautious not only on the level of your prior guidance for \u201823 but also the shape of the future revenue curves beyond \u201823. So, my question is on the latter, shape of the future curve. Are you confident still in saying that 2023 should be the trough, and then you\u2019ll rebound to some higher level of sales in 2024 and beyond and see kind of continued growth from that point forward, or is that now more uncertain, too?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. I think that this year\u2019s utilization at the marketplace will form the basis that we can predict reliably for the next years. I don\u2019t think it will be any much different because there will be no different categories in the marketplace. Vaccination rates will settle and then the treatment and infection rates also would be, after a new year, indicate what we should expect periodically. Clearly, we will have to deal with some inventories movements, and this year was a transition year because we are going to give prices, and we are going to absorb some of inventories, et cetera. So that should be for the accurate number for \u201824 and beyond, but should be the base and likely should be higher than what you should see this year. But that -- provided that we have a reasonable vaccination and treatment range of Paxlovid. So that\u2019s why I say that let\u2019s wait to see what would be the actual in this year and clearly, what will be the utilization, as I said. Because next year, all these inventories and price adjustment things will be very clear what it will be. So thank you very much for the question. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. And thank you for taking the question and for all the transparency on your thought process on the COVID side. Plenty of good -- great questions asked this morning. I guess, one I want -- didn\u2019t get addressed is you out-licensed TL1A late last year, your partner, then turns around and sells it for quite substantially more. I guess, so to be a bit provocative, Albert, were Pfizer shareholders well served by this course of events? I would love to give you the opportunity to address that publicly. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Carter, for giving us this opportunity. And also thank you for recognizing the transparency. I think that\u2019s very important, particularly when there\u2019s uncertainty. We should all know what the scenarios and the parameters are and what the actions that could be potentially triggered for different scenarios. Now let\u2019s go to TL1A and let\u2019s see what is the situation, Aamir. Have we served the shareholders the best of our knowledge or not?\nAamir Malik: Thanks for the question, Carter. And obviously, I\u2019m not going to comment on the rumors and speculation or the potential prices attached to different transactions. What I will say is we\u2019re very pleased with our TL1A Telavant partnership with Roivant and we do think shareholders were well served. So, as a reminder, why we entered this? We entered this as an R&D portfolio prioritization decision. So from time to time, we make decisions as part of our disciplined process to our partner R&D programs, where we think it is better to share the risk or the cost with a partner. And in this case, Telavant covers all of the R&D costs going forward. And that frees up significant R&D capacity for Pfizer to invest in high priority programs. But we still retained value in this program in three different ways. We had a 25% equity stake in Telavant. We have full ex U.S. and ex Japan rights and we earned royalties on the U.S. and Japan sales. So, taken together, this collaboration allows us to keep more than 50% of the total value of TL1A with zero incremental R&D spend. And for a Phase 2 program, we feel this is a very sound move for Pfizer shareholders.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Mikael, anything to add here?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Aamir, said it well. And I just wanted to punctuate among the very many options, we have a strong platform in bispecific in many therapeutic, including in immunology and we do have TL1A antibody. That would be very interesting, where we own an even greater share. We have triple specifics that are going into atopic dermatitis. So it just punctuates. Even in the very same therapeutic area, we have so many things going on. And near term, we expect soon approval for etrasimod and another readout [indiscernible]. So a lot to start there.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Don\u2019t tip competition too much about what we have in our pocket. So let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Next, we have Steve Scala with Cowen.\nSteve Scala: I just have an observation than a question, but the observation is that it\u2019s still not clear what has changed in your long-term COVID expectations versus when you first gave the $30 billion guidance 6 months ago since in the prior 6 months, nothing really has changed other than FDA action, which doesn\u2019t impact the long term. So, that\u2019s just an observation. But my question is on Vyndaqel. Vyndaqel has become a very important franchise, yet its exclusivity is not long in either the U.S. or the EU. Are there any strategies to get around the LOEs, or is it simply similar to Eliquis where post LOEs, Pfizer -- move on to other products?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. So, why don\u2019t you take the question, Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Yes. Well, it is, as you say, an incredibly important product, and we\u2019re just so proud of the fact that it\u2019s still growing 40-something percent this quarter. I think when it comes to LOEs, just from the perspective of how we see it, our composition of matter at patent expires in 2024, but we are -- patent term extensions that get us through December of 2028; in the EU, it\u2019s 2026; in Japan, it goes right up to 2029. So actually, I feel like we still have a good runway as it pertains to this product, more diagnoses that we need to do and more patients that we can capture on to Vyndaqel, especially with the incredibly competitive and differentiated profile that we have. As you say, we\u2019re always, and working with Aamir, looking at opportunities as to what might be good fit into what might fit well into this franchise in this portfolio. But I guess from my perspective, with or without it, we see an incredibly strong opportunity for us to continue to capture growth.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\nDavid Risinger: So my question is on Pfizer\u2019s mRNA flu vaccine candidate, please. And Sanofi had stated at its recent Vaccines Analyst Day that first-generation mRNAs against flu will not deliver sufficient strain B efficacy, given mRNA technical issues in targeting strain B. So, could you just comment on that and your expectations for your vaccine\u2019s southern hemisphere strain B efficacy results later this year? I know that there wasn\u2019t the emergence of strain B in the northern hemisphere, but I\u2019m curious about your expectations for demonstrating that strain B efficacy in the southern hemisphere. And then in addition, if you could just comment on your expected reactogenicity profile for mRNA flu versus Comirnaty\u2019s reactogenicity profile?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, David. Very good questions. Mikael, so are technical issues that Sanofi is having, are we experiencing as well.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Well, I think the difference between maybe the pioneering mRNA companies Pfizer and of course there is Moderna that have worked on this technology in many years. We have ourselves been 5 years into it and make ample improvement across the entire mRNA chain. And I think it just gives us a big leg up and an what experience we had with COVID vaccine. So, I can\u2019t really comment on the issues that Sanofi are facing. I share a much more positive -- I have a much more positive outlook that we have in our capability to design mRNA vaccines that will be powerful against flu A and also against flu B. And let\u2019s wait as we accumulate data and see the outcome. But, I\u2019m optimistic about that and realize it\u2019s a field that requires a lot of capability to enter.\nDr. Albert Bourla: What about the reactogenicity?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: The flu reactogenicity has actually been moderate, been really good. So, that\u2019s not an issue at all at end of the doses that we have been testing in young or older patients.\nOperator: Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Could you talk about the impact of price negotiation under the IRA? Expressly, could you talk to whether you\u2019ll be able to collapse the rebate to PBMs in order to offset the impact of, let\u2019s say, Eliquis price reduction, following the price negotiations and therefore, protect your earnings, or do you think you\u2019ll have to still pay the PBMs their pound of flesh, even though they\u2019re being able to buy the drug at a much reduced price or fund the drug at a much reduced price? And then separately, for Mikael, given the recent acquisition of Seagen, to what extent -- or planned acquisition of Seagen, to what extent do you believe that there is a potential to review your existing pipeline in order to make room or further optimize your R&D spend to put behind Seagen\u2019s additional assets?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. So, why don\u2019t we go first to answer about what IRA will mean in terms of changing the rebates, et cetera, which it\u2019s quite a new situation. So, we have to see how it plays. But if you want to speak a little bit about it, Angela?\nAngela Hwang: Yes, sure. So, that\u2019s exactly right, Albert. I think there\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a new policy and lots to understand in terms of how it\u2019s going to play out. As you say, there will be price negotiations, but at the same time, I think that what we also have to remember, Andrew, is that there\u2019s a mitigating factor of the fact that more patients likely will be able to get on Eliquis because of the co-pay threshold and that sort of cap we\u2019re going to have as a function of IRA. And so, I think it\u2019s a dynamic situation. There\u2019s a lot for us to consider as it pertains to pricing, rebates, but also patient utilization of the drug and all of this will play out. I guess, as it pertains specifically also to Eliquis, just to remind everyone that those obviously one of our largest drugs, its LOE will be around that \u201826 time frame. So, whatever the impact is, will not be long lasting on our portfolio because it\u2019s losing patent anyway around that time.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, Angela. It\u2019s an evolving environment, so we need to really see. Also, Andrew, very quickly on the pipeline issue, we have made very clear about the Seagen acquisition will mean nothing to the pipeline assets. So, no pipeline assets will be eliminated or reduced or increased as a result of -- actually, would be increased because of the combination but will not be any reductions on pipeline assets as a result of this acquisition.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just a two-parter on Comirnaty. Can you just help me a little bit in terms of, I guess, with the updated vaccine being commercialized in September, how much of your remaining COVID revenue should we think about in 3Q versus 4Q? And I\u2019m just trying to get my sense of when we get this 3Q update, will that be based on the sales we\u2019re seeing in the quarter or more your interpretation of the trend we\u2019re seeing for vaccinations, so just setting expectations? And the second part was on the EU contract renegotiation. Just any additional color you can provide on how different, I guess, the terms end up being for 2023 relative to what was reflected in the 2023 guidance?\nDr. Albert Bourla: I can take it very quickly. Look, if you see, we will have basically July, August, September in the third quarter. So the vaccinations with the new will start in September, hopefully. Of course, what we expect is that we will have approval by the end of the August. And we are ready with product already now. So we have -- so the production will not be an issue. So normally, we should have also in Q3, most of it in Q4. But what really will clarify us at the end of Q3 plus also the month that takes after Q3 until we give -- we present our Q3 results. It is really vaccination rate. That is what will inform. And the net price, right? Because everything after all, we\u2019ll know way better what the net price. Also very big part of this uncertainty for Comirnaty will go away. On the EU contract renegotiation, I don\u2019t know if you noticed, I did say that when we gave our guidance, we were expecting that we will have incorporated assumptions that we will renegotiate the EU contract. And our assumptions were assuming that we will do over three years. Now we did over four years that creates a pressure to our guidance, but then we had some contracts that we didn\u2019t expect, guidance in Latin America, particularly but offset very big part of that. So that\u2019s why there\u2019s no -- that\u2019s but by itself is not a reason to change the guidance one way or another. Really, as I said, vaccination rates, it is what will define what is the potential of these vaccines for the years to come. Thank you very much, Chris. And then, we\u2019ll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we have Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.\nRajesh Kumar: Just one for me. You\u2019re doing a lot of acquisitions. You\u2019ve done a large one, Seagen recently, it\u2019s not completed. But as we look forward, how do you think the -- what are the sort of integration challenges you see, both on the execution, commercial side but also on the scientific side? What are the things that get you excited versus worried?\nDr. Albert Bourla: For the Seagen acquisition, right? Yes. Let me start\u2026\nRajesh Kumar: Multiple acquisitions before that as well. So just you\u2019ve got multi integrations going on sort of, that\u2019s why I asked the question.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. So let me start with what excites us with Seagen. And I think there\u2019s the science behind this company. The ADCs are playing a key role right now, more and more in our research and in our fight against cancer. And Seagen has one of the two leading platforms and we believe it\u2019s actually a better one. So, I think that excites me a lot. Also what excites me a lot is that Seagen was able to achieve all this greatness with limited resources relatively compared to what we are bringing on the table. And what we are bringing on the table on the research front, of course, is not only the capital but also a significant expertise in designing the molecules. And particularly in the small molecules, we are very, very, very good. So when it speaks about payloads, I think we can contribute significantly into that. Secondly, we are thinking that there is such a nice way of being able to commercialize those products of Seagen that are already in the market or we can because as we look at global presence, that Seagen is lucky. And also in the U.S., we will almost triple our resources, once the whole thing is integrated. So, there is a lot of things to be excited. Now, as you rightly pointed out, things happen in integration but you need to be very aware. And not only we -- I do have our fair share of things that we did wrong in the past and we have our fair share of things that we did right in the past. So, I know what is extremely, extremely important is to make sure that, first of all, there will be no cultural clash as we are putting together the two organizations. To that end, we are very, very lucky because oncology companies tend to have very, very similar cultures, irrelevant they are small or big, they\u2019re oncology companies. And that was evident in the chemistry of our scientists compared to the Seagen scientists. Actually, where it is really evident, it is how many of the great scientists of Seagen raised their hand to join Chris\u2019s leadership team as we\u2019re going forward. And those scientists we have published this information, who will be coming from Seagen. Actually, many of them will lead the global oncology business, not only \u2013 acquisition, not only the Pfizer one but they will lead the global -- not only the Seagen one but the global, which is Seagen plus global. The second thing that we need to be very careful is that we don\u2019t slow down things, and we don\u2019t increase cost of things. This is something that we have seen when big companies are acquiring small that many times cost goes double and the time lines goes also double. So that\u2019s something that we must avoid. And in order to avoid, we are doing tremendous pre-integration planning to make sure that innovation will be enhanced dramatically after we are putting the two together. And I have full trust on, of course, Chris, that is leading this integration on this planning for months now. And last but not least, many times, when you have an integration, it could go wrong and it\u2019s good if the CEO, which is the one who can resolve conflicts in a corporation and make decisions fast, has very high visibility in what was happening. So I went very fast. This is our biggest investment for many decades. That\u2019s clearly the biggest investment under my watch. And we take it very seriously as one of the most potential exciting opportunities to grow but also, we are very cognizant that we should make sure that nothing goes wrong. So I\u2019m personally on it and Seagen is going to be one of our biggest bets as you can see going forward. So we are using all our experience and the best people and are very, very pleased. I\u2019m very, very pleased because chemistry of the two teams is unbeatable right now. And they are working like one and they are all coming to see the new Seagen/Pfizer oncology portfolio growing faster than when we were alone. And with that, we will move to our last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Michelle Rivera with inThought Research.\nMichelle Rivera: What\u2019s the status of the DMD gene therapy program? Have you finalized dosing patients? I read a statement at a recent conference that you finalized screening patients. So, I was not sure whether that meant that the trial had been paused. Just some clarity around that and when we should expect data would be helpful. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes. Chris, you were running DMD until recently. Now, you of course, provided to Mikael the responsibility. So, can you give us a little bit very quickly what is the status of DMD?\nDr. Chris Boshoff: Yes. Thank you. So the -- as I mentioned earlier, the cynical trial has now completed enrollment. And as you pointed out, we halt dosing for the last couple of patients due to a protocol amendment, but we\u2019re very confident that we will go ahead and have the interim analysis later this year based on the functional end point which will be substituted also or which will be -- yes, with the biomarker data, so we\u2019ll have both functional data as well as biomarker data later this year, and then the final analysis for the full study in 2024. We\u2019ve also fully enrolled now the earlier age group patients between the ages of 2 and 3 years old, 10 patients enrolled in that trial. So yes, we\u2019re looking forward to share the data later this year for you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much. In summary, I think we had a solid quarter. Continue to invest to support our unprecedented 19 potential launches in an 18-month period. These are doing very well. The plan is executed as the time lines, in our pipeline and in value-creating revenue-generating business development opportunities like Seagen, which, as I articulated just in the question before that, it is clearly our big bet and our very, very big opportunity moving forward. Over the next three months, we look forward to moving beyond the current uncertainty related to our COVID-19-related revenue. So, we\u2019ll have better clarity. And by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have -- the uncertain will be removed almost largely. To that extent, but any adjustments to our cost base for \u201824 and beyond, we are ready to make. I want to reemphasize that the biggest uncertainty in terms of the long term is vaccination rate, some shorter uncertainties like when commercialization will be, I think it\u2019s just a question of time. But the vaccination and treatment rates that we are going to see, I think, will inform what is -- what we should expect for the years to come, with only upside if we the combination vaccines. Putting all these factors together, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a robust operational growth and deliver meaningful shareholder value through the end of the decade and beyond. And now, we will bring our call to a close. Thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Pfizer\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dr. Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. Non-COVID-19 revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. Total revenues declined 53% operationally, primarily due to the anticipated revenue declines in both Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Even with these declines, our COVID-19 portfolio remained a significant contributor to the business with more than $1.6 billion in combined revenues during this quarter. Of course, our patient impact data are equally important because patients are the reason we exist. Through the first six months of the year, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. We continue to make progress towards our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. In fact, Pfizer is more than halfway of its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in an 18-month span. In addition to the six approvals and five launches that occurred prior to 2023, we had six approvals and four launches in the first six months of 2023. For the second half of 2023, we expect six additional approvals and six additional launches, including the two launches that occurred in July. Then in 2024, we expect one approval and four launches, which, if approved and recommended, would raise the total to 19 new launches in approximately 18 months. As you can see in this chart, for this year's launches, we expect the revenue contribution to occur largely in the second half of 2023 because the first-half launches occurred late in the second quarter. And then in 2024, with the additional impact of next year's expected launches, we anticipate an even greater total contribution for our 19 launches. It's important to note that 18 of the 19 potential launches have been largely derisked from a technical perspective at this point, with the only one remaining being our RNA flu candidate. Equally encouraging is that our pipeline is expected to continue generating breakthrough treatments and vaccines long after the 19 we have been discussing. We recently reported milestones from several exciting pipeline candidates with the potential to be significant future value drivers. These include: Phase 3 data from marstacimab, a novel antibody being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A and B; regulatory filing acceptance for our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate; the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of Phase 2 results for our vaccine candidate for maternal immunization against Group B Streptococcus; and first-in-human data from our pipeline of potential next-generation breast cancer treatments, including our novel CDK4, CDK2, and KAT6 inhibitors. Now, I would like to provide some commentary on our COVID-19 portfolio. As you all know, during the pandemic, Pfizer demonstrated impressively the power of our research and manufacturing capabilities by bringing to the world the first and most widely used vaccine and oral treatment for COVID-19. These scientific breakthroughs have played a significant role in bringing the global health crisis under control, and we are very proud of our contributions. The profits these products have generated to date have enabled us to invest in acquiring Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics, which together we expect to contribute approximately $10 billion of revenues in 2030. In fact, the acquisitions of Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics are already contributing to our operational growth, while the acquisition of Arena is expected to start generating revenues toward the end of this year. We also remain very excited about our planned acquisition of Seagen, which, if approved, is expected to contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 revenues. As a result of the positive momentum of our non-COVID-19 revenues and, more importantly, the success of our COVID-19 portfolio, Pfizer's overall revenues have increased exponentially compared with our 2019 revenues, pro forma for the divestitures of Upjohn and our consumer business. This allowed us to increase investments in R&D and SI&A to support this new revenue base and our expected new product launches. The increased investments we are making in R&D and SI&A this year were sized based on certain revenue assumptions we made in January for both our COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 products. These assumptions also were incorporated in our 2023 financial guidance. Clearly, there is a higher level of uncertainty regarding the demand projections for our COVID-19 products than for the rest of the business. For example, in January, we shared our expectation that approximately 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines would be administered in the U.S. this year, of which we estimated Pfizer to capture 60% market share. In the first six months of 2023, 12.4 million doses were administered in the U.S. While the 12.4 million doses are behind our earlier projections, our market share for COVID-19 is ahead of our previous expectations at 65%. However, the vast majority of respiratory vaccinations happen during the fall and winter respiratory disease season, which starts in September, and we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to follow this pattern going forward. The uncertainty of the exact timing of Comirnaty commercialization was largely removed with the decision by the FDA and CDC to request a change in the composition of the vaccine to address the Omicron XBB 1.5 strain. We believe this will allow us to commercialize the vaccine in September, assuming the updated vaccines are approved and available by the end of August. In the European Union, the uncertainty regarding the vaccine's revenue contributions for 2023 and beyond was removed when we renegotiated successfully our long-term agreement. This agreement spreads the agreed volumes over four years, and while it puts pressure on this year's volumes, we believe it also provides longer-term revenue certainty in this important market. Similar to what we are experiencing with the vaccine, the second half of the year will play a bigger role in informing our expectations for the long-term demand for Paxlovid, the utilization of which follows very closely the COVID-19 infection rates. We expect a new COVID-19 wave to start in the U.S. this fall, and this expectation is supported by the increase in infection rates we are already seeing. Obviously, the severity of disease and people's desire for treatment also will be factors, as will the ongoing dialogue with the U.S. government regarding when we will transition to a commercial model for Paxlovid. These are the uncertainties. We are acutely aware that all these uncertainties are making it difficult to project the future revenues of Pfizer in this area and at large at Pfizer and also affecting our stock price, as a result. The good news is we will have much more clarity and certainty regarding how our COVID-19 products will perform in a commercial market, by the time we report our third-quarter financial results, and we expect the uncertainties to be largely eliminated by the end of the year. This is because we expect the vaccination and treatment rates from the upcoming respiratory disease season to be a reliable predictor of trends in subsequent years, with some potential upside of course, if a combination flu and COVID-19 vaccine is brought to market in the future. Additionally, by that point the timing of transitioning to full commercialization of both Comirnaty and Paxlovid should become clear. Despite this uncertainty, we will continue to invest in our COVID-19 portfolio this year in advance of the upcoming respiratory disease season. This is very important. But given the uncertainty, we are also preparing to have the ability to adjust our 2024 total cost base to align with various future COVID-19 revenue scenarios. In fact, we have already identified specific areas where we can make adjustments, primarily within our COVID-19 cost base, if demand comes in lower than expected. Dave will provide more details during his remarks. Next, I wanted to share a few quick updates of our planned acquisition of Seagen, which we believe will be a major driver of our future success. Seagen's shareholders recently overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition, and we have already raised most of the external financing needed to fund the transaction. We also continue to work closely with regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. In the meantime, our integration planning continues, which will allow us to hit the ground running following an anticipated close later in 2023 or early in 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Last week, we announced that Chris Boshoff has joined Pfizer's Executive Leadership Team as Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President, reporting directly to me. In this role, Chris will lead a new, end-to-end Oncology R&D organization and be the single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline, from discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development. This is similar to the structure we currently have in place for our Vaccines R&D organization, which has proven to be very productive. Pfizer and Seagen share a common vision to deliver life-saving treatments for people living with cancer, which is why I am so pleased that, after closing, Chris's Oncology leadership team will include talented, purpose-driven and highly productive leaders from both companies. And we made already announcements about the people that are joining Chris's leadership team. We believe this new structure will help further accelerate the delivery of cancer therapies, which is critical because in the battle against cancer, time is life. At Pfizer one of our core business principles is the belief that \u201cTrust is Everything.\u201d I'm proud to share that in recent months, we have received some wonderful accolades that speak to the trust we are building with external stakeholders. We were named one of the 2023-2024 \u201cBest Companies to Work For\u201d by U.S. News & World Report. We were listed in Newsweek's list of \u201cAmerica's Greatest Workplaces 2023.\u201d For the third year in a row, Pfizer has earned a top 100 score in the 2023 \u201cDisability Equality Index.\u201d And our own Rady Johnson received the Disability:IN 2023 Executive Sponsor of the Year Award at the National Conference in July. Lastly, our PGS site in Ascoli, Italy is being recognized by the United Nations for the \u201cWelcome Award - Working for Refugee Integration.\u201d These recognitions are very important because they strengthen the unprecedented brand equity that Pfizer built during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before I hand it over to Dave, I want to quickly comment on the situation at our facility in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First, all of us at Pfizer were relieved that no colleagues were seriously injured when the tornado struck. That said, our facility sustained substantial damage, as did the neighborhoods where many of our colleagues live, unfortunately. The local leadership team has done an incredible job responding to this devastating event, and we are proceeding with both, urgency and caution to determine the best way to get the site back online as quickly as possible, so as to minimize any impact on patients. Of course, we are also aking steps to ensure the continued safety of our colleagues and contractors, which remains our top priority. And with that, I will turn it over to Dave. And after Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave? Maybe Angela can answer that. The question was, do you expect the share decision to have a big impact on RSV and also do we expect in the U.S. and also do we expect any impact, excluding the U.S.? And what about the ex-U.S.? Thank you very much, Angela. I hope we gave what you asked, Robyn. Operator, the next question please. Let me clarify. Of course, it would be enterprise-wide, but what I said is that the COVID part is going to be the biggest one. Right now, you need to know that R&D and SI&A cost of COVID is billions, it's not a small amount. So, it's -- there's a lot over there. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the prospects to move ahead at danu? Mikael? Thank you, Terence. Let's start with Dave Thank you, David. Mikael mRNA flu. Let me say a few words about the Rocky Mount, and then I'll ask Dave to answer the question about the cost adjustment program in case we have a significant reduction on our revenues because of the COVID. The Rocky Mount, it was severe, the damage of the hurricane, but the damage was mainly concentrated on the warehouse, which means that we lost a lot of inventory that was about to be sent to the markets. The facilities per se, the production facilities were not impacted by the hurricane. So, the buildings are standing there. However, because the utilities were discontinued, the facilities had to stop operating. And in this highly sensitive, sterile environment, when you are losing power, it's not easy to switch on and switch off. It takes time and a lot of processes so that you can start. And the additional challenge will be some of the inventories of materials that were also destroyed, particularly glass and other stuff. We need to make sure that we will replace in time. So, what I want to say is that we feel very confident that the whole thing will go back to life. But still, we are assessing how long that will take. And we are doing anything we can to make sure that we will minimize the shortages in the marketplace because of that. Now, let's move to some more color on the cost adjustment program. All right. So, on the COVID, I will say a few words and then I will ask Angela to comment on both. Look, the COVID scenario, it depends what are the uncertainties? I think I articulated. Let's start with the vaccine. The biggest uncertainty is vaccination rates. I think market share is pretty much, I think, well established. Vaccination rate is what we are going to see in the fall that is coming. So, that will be a big uncertainty. Another uncertainty was the time of commercialization in the U.S. because, of course, you go with new inventories, new sales to the market and with higher prices. That has been resolved. We know that it's very likely that we launch in September because FDA and CDC, they asked us to change the inventories basically by creating a new vaccine. So, that will happen. And also, the other uncertainty that existed about the COVID vaccine was the European contract. That was a very long -- very big contract. And now we have the certainty that it has been negotiated, a little bit less for the year because it's spread over four years, but let's say, renegotiated. So all of that are -- the key, of course, there is how much the Japan, Latin America and other countries will purchase, it's not the only ones, but let's say, those are the fundamentals. And we will know pretty much the trend in the third quarter. And we will know pretty much quite accurate what is the situation in the end of the year, but I think will be a very good predictor of what we should expect going forward with the only upside if we have a combined vaccine with flu or with RSV, that will increase the vaccination rate. On Paxlovid, a little bit more uncertainty because, of course, we are having the uncertainty of treatment rates and infection rates. And we don't know how that behaves. We don't have any benchmark to see how that goes. We know that the treatment rates are following very close the infection rates, and the infection rates are rising right now, but that remains to be seen how that will go. Of course, also the sales of Paxlovid are rising as we see in the market, the scripts on a weekly basis as always do when the infection rates are going up. But we have some more uncertainty, which is the timing of launch, which will depend on how we will agree for the interest of public health to transition this launch with the U.S. government. So, all of that remains to be seen. And these are the scenarios that we see for COVID. And the key message is the uncertainty will go away at the end of the year. We will know what COVID will contribute on a stable basis in Pfizer's revenue and we will go from there. Now, Angela, maybe if you want anything to add to that and also about the next question -- the other question. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is yes, we should get way better feeling. It's not that we just want to see another quarter. We want to see the big quarter of good respiratory season. COVID, we always said and everybody, I think, thinks that that is a common sense that will follow going forward the seasonality of the other respiratory vaccines, thus becoming more and more and more clear, right? And the majority of these vaccinations are happening in the third and fourth quarter for the year. So it's not that we are just another quarter. We're awaiting the main quarter. If COVID vaccinations go anywhere close to the flu vaccination rates, then we have a very big bit of what we expect to have. If they are a small fraction of what will happen for flu, then of course, we have a mix. So, that's why we are going to see how that will evolve. So it's a very, very important quarter. The rest, although for the first half of the year, we have quite significant contribution towards the total growth. So, we don't need -- not much of inventory if we get the utilization over there to make sure that we know how big the COVID franchise will become. And as I said, in the EU, we have adjusted very well. We will have high certainty, Paxlovid also. It's a very, very good market. We don't know how in the next wave the Paxlovid will be used. We have the rest of the world, but the inventories, they were also last year. So we are now expecting that products will start being going -- other expiring or product will start more reordering from many more countries. So that's why the infection rates on the Paxlovid will be extremely, extremely important. And all of that are happening now. So, once we know them, we can predict way more accurate. Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you. The LOEs are coming basically from year \u201826, right? So, all the way to \u201825, I think the impact will not be that high. Also, the guidance that we gave was 6%, yes, we feel quite confident that we will be there. So, we'll continue and we are at 6% right now all these years, right, year-to-date. So yes, the non-COVID business, I think, clearly, the success of the launches is very important. So we'll see a lot of things coming ahead of us. But it is a way better predictable. And I think we are there. So, I don't think there will be any variability. Yes. Thank you. So, Mikael, again, clearly the obesity market and the size of it is creating a lot of interest in danuglipron. And so the question was about the one day formulation. And then also tell us a little bit about where we are with DMD. That was terrific. I just wanted to add that we have, like you heard Sarepta, ample biomarker that look very robust in our hand. But as Chris said, we want to provide patients with even more experience about the potential benefit. Let me start with the COVID and then Mikael also can comment. But for example, we are very excited about the combinations, right? And the combinations will be flu and COVID and then hopefully also flu, COVID and RSV. And we are working on that. And we believe actually that the fact that if we have a combination with the non-mRNA included over there, we'll have likely that we expect to have the benefit of better safety profile because we don't have to load three products RNA into a single injection, but we will be using only two, COVID and flu, and then we'll use the protein-based vaccine, which has very -- profile in RSVs. All of that are working very well. Now, the question is what will happen if the COVID market is seen to be very -- as monovalent as very, very low. I think that will play a key role in our decision about controlling the cost. Because if it is very, very low, although we expect an upside in the combination, we will assume at this stage that the medical need for COVID is not that high. And as a result, we will reduce our investments in the area and also will temper our expectations for sales. And then if the combinations come and we are way more successful, that's a different story. You want also -- what was your second question? Yes, about marstacimab, Mikael? Thank you very much. Let's move to the next question, please. And we are a little bit -- the time is flying, so a lot of interest. So let's try to be more -- 1 question, please, each one. So Angela, how concerned you are with the competitive environment? I know with respect to our competitors, but we have some realities that maybe you want to discuss. And also, I would like actually Chris Boshoff to answer the question of CDK4 since we have him here in his new capacity. Angela? And that is under the competition of PCV15, which I think was around 150 million, if I'm not mistaken. Chris, can you please speak about the CDK4 and the franchise in general over there? Yes. I think that this year's utilization at the marketplace will form the basis that we can predict reliably for the next years. I don't think it will be any much different because there will be no different categories in the marketplace. Vaccination rates will settle and then the treatment and infection rates also would be, after a new year, indicate what we should expect periodically. Clearly, we will have to deal with some inventories movements, and this year was a transition year because we are going to give prices, and we are going to absorb some of inventories, et cetera. So that should be for the accurate number for \u201824 and beyond, but should be the base and likely should be higher than what you should see this year. But that -- provided that we have a reasonable vaccination and treatment range of Paxlovid. So that's why I say that let's wait to see what would be the actual in this year and clearly, what will be the utilization, as I said. Because next year, all these inventories and price adjustment things will be very clear what it will be. So thank you very much for the question. Let's move to the next question, please. Thank you, Carter, for giving us this opportunity. And also thank you for recognizing the transparency. I think that's very important, particularly when there's uncertainty. We should all know what the scenarios and the parameters are and what the actions that could be potentially triggered for different scenarios. Now let's go to TL1A and let's see what is the situation, Aamir. Have we served the shareholders the best of our knowledge or not? Mikael, anything to add here? Thank you, Mikael. Don't tip competition too much about what we have in our pocket. So let's go to the next question. Yes. So, why don't you take the question, Angela? Thank you very much, David. Very good questions. Mikael, so are technical issues that Sanofi is having, are we experiencing as well. What about the reactogenicity? Yes. So, why don't we go first to answer about what IRA will mean in terms of changing the rebates, et cetera, which it's quite a new situation. So, we have to see how it plays. But if you want to speak a little bit about it, Angela? Thank you very much, Angela. It's an evolving environment, so we need to really see. Also, Andrew, very quickly on the pipeline issue, we have made very clear about the Seagen acquisition will mean nothing to the pipeline assets. So, no pipeline assets will be eliminated or reduced or increased as a result of -- actually, would be increased because of the combination but will not be any reductions on pipeline assets as a result of this acquisition. I can take it very quickly. Look, if you see, we will have basically July, August, September in the third quarter. So the vaccinations with the new will start in September, hopefully. Of course, what we expect is that we will have approval by the end of the August. And we are ready with product already now. So we have -- so the production will not be an issue. So normally, we should have also in Q3, most of it in Q4. But what really will clarify us at the end of Q3 plus also the month that takes after Q3 until we give -- we present our Q3 results. It is really vaccination rate. That is what will inform. And the net price, right? Because everything after all, we'll know way better what the net price. Also very big part of this uncertainty for Comirnaty will go away. On the EU contract renegotiation, I don't know if you noticed, I did say that when we gave our guidance, we were expecting that we will have incorporated assumptions that we will renegotiate the EU contract. And our assumptions were assuming that we will do over three years. Now we did over four years that creates a pressure to our guidance, but then we had some contracts that we didn't expect, guidance in Latin America, particularly but offset very big part of that. So that's why there's no -- that's but by itself is not a reason to change the guidance one way or another. Really, as I said, vaccination rates, it is what will define what is the potential of these vaccines for the years to come. Thank you very much, Chris. And then, we'll go to the next question, please. For the Seagen acquisition, right? Yes. Let me start... Yes. So let me start with what excites us with Seagen. And I think there's the science behind this company. The ADCs are playing a key role right now, more and more in our research and in our fight against cancer. And Seagen has one of the two leading platforms and we believe it's actually a better one. So, I think that excites me a lot. Also what excites me a lot is that Seagen was able to achieve all this greatness with limited resources relatively compared to what we are bringing on the table. And what we are bringing on the table on the research front, of course, is not only the capital but also a significant expertise in designing the molecules. And particularly in the small molecules, we are very, very, very good. So when it speaks about payloads, I think we can contribute significantly into that. Secondly, we are thinking that there is such a nice way of being able to commercialize those products of Seagen that are already in the market or we can because as we look at global presence, that Seagen is lucky. And also in the U.S., we will almost triple our resources, once the whole thing is integrated. So, there is a lot of things to be excited. Now, as you rightly pointed out, things happen in integration but you need to be very aware. And not only we -- I do have our fair share of things that we did wrong in the past and we have our fair share of things that we did right in the past. So, I know what is extremely, extremely important is to make sure that, first of all, there will be no cultural clash as we are putting together the two organizations. To that end, we are very, very lucky because oncology companies tend to have very, very similar cultures, irrelevant they are small or big, they're oncology companies. And that was evident in the chemistry of our scientists compared to the Seagen scientists. Actually, where it is really evident, it is how many of the great scientists of Seagen raised their hand to join Chris's leadership team as we're going forward. And those scientists we have published this information, who will be coming from Seagen. Actually, many of them will lead the global oncology business, not only \u2013 acquisition, not only the Pfizer one but they will lead the global -- not only the Seagen one but the global, which is Seagen plus global. The second thing that we need to be very careful is that we don't slow down things, and we don't increase cost of things. This is something that we have seen when big companies are acquiring small that many times cost goes double and the time lines goes also double. So that's something that we must avoid. And in order to avoid, we are doing tremendous pre-integration planning to make sure that innovation will be enhanced dramatically after we are putting the two together. And I have full trust on, of course, Chris, that is leading this integration on this planning for months now. And last but not least, many times, when you have an integration, it could go wrong and it's good if the CEO, which is the one who can resolve conflicts in a corporation and make decisions fast, has very high visibility in what was happening. So I went very fast. This is our biggest investment for many decades. That's clearly the biggest investment under my watch. And we take it very seriously as one of the most potential exciting opportunities to grow but also, we are very cognizant that we should make sure that nothing goes wrong. So I'm personally on it and Seagen is going to be one of our biggest bets as you can see going forward. So we are using all our experience and the best people and are very, very pleased. I'm very, very pleased because chemistry of the two teams is unbeatable right now. And they are working like one and they are all coming to see the new Seagen/Pfizer oncology portfolio growing faster than when we were alone. And with that, we will move to our last question. Yes. Chris, you were running DMD until recently. Now, you of course, provided to Mikael the responsibility. So, can you give us a little bit very quickly what is the status of DMD? Thank you very much. In summary, I think we had a solid quarter. Continue to invest to support our unprecedented 19 potential launches in an 18-month period. These are doing very well. The plan is executed as the time lines, in our pipeline and in value-creating revenue-generating business development opportunities like Seagen, which, as I articulated just in the question before that, it is clearly our big bet and our very, very big opportunity moving forward. Over the next three months, we look forward to moving beyond the current uncertainty related to our COVID-19-related revenue. So, we'll have better clarity. And by the end of the year, we'll have -- the uncertain will be removed almost largely. To that extent, but any adjustments to our cost base for \u201824 and beyond, we are ready to make. I want to reemphasize that the biggest uncertainty in terms of the long term is vaccination rate, some shorter uncertainties like when commercialization will be, I think it's just a question of time. But the vaccination and treatment rates that we are going to see, I think, will inform what is -- what we should expect for the years to come, with only upside if we the combination vaccines. Putting all these factors together, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a robust operational growth and deliver meaningful shareholder value through the end of the decade and beyond. And now, we will bring our call to a close. Thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your day."

            "name": "Dr. Chris Boshoff",
            "content": "Thank you, Mikael. So the DMD program is obviously very important for us, not just for the importance of gene therapy but for patients and families with this absolutely devastating disease. And we do have an interim analysis later this year for the CIFFREO trial. The CIFFREO trial, all patients have now been enrolled in the study. The interim analysis will be based not on a surrogate biomarker end point but on truly functional end point. So, we believe that's the best way to measure the benefit of gene therapy in this disease is with a functional end point. And that should come later this year, and we'll update you with the final analysis for the study then in 2024. Thank you for the question. So, as you know, ER-positive breast cancer is the most common cancer globally for women, and we were very proud that we can build on our leadership in cell cycle inhibition with Ibrance, and with 3 first-in-class potential assets, CDK4-specific inhibitor, CDK2-specific inhibitor and a KAT6-specific inhibitor, all through the significant potential to transform treatment in the future for ER-positive breast cancer. For CDK4, we have seen more complete and continuous CDK4 target coverage and potentially improved tolerability due to reduced CDK6 inhibition. And as Mikael has pointed out, CDK6 leads to the hematological vulnerability. We know that epithelial cell specifically highly expressed CDK4, and that's why it's so important to specifically target CDK4. And what we've seen, as Mikael has pointed out, is Grade 3 neutropenia are 15% of our CDK4 inhibitor, and that's versus 60% as expected with other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We've also not noted any Grade 3 diarrhea. And again, that's very different from what you know from some of the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We're accelerating our registration strategy with the first study in second-line post CDK4/6, where we've recently shown 30% overall response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and we're also starting populations with CDK4 plus CDK2 as well as CDK4 with our potential next-generation backbone, ARV-471 or vepdegestrant, which we are codeveloping with Arvinas. Yes. Thank you. So the -- as I mentioned earlier, the cynical trial has now completed enrollment. And as you pointed out, we halt dosing for the last couple of patients due to a protocol amendment, but we're very confident that we will go ahead and have the interim analysis later this year based on the functional end point which will be substituted also or which will be -- yes, with the biomarker data, so we'll have both functional data as well as biomarker data later this year, and then the final analysis for the full study in 2024. We've also fully enrolled now the earlier age group patients between the ages of 2 and 3 years old, 10 patients enrolled in that trial. So yes, we're looking forward to share the data later this year for you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dave Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 24 months, Pfizer has made important investments to position it squarely on track to achieve profitable and sustainable growth particulary in the back half of this decade. We have strategically invested to expand our commercial portfolio and our late-stage pipeline, strengthen our market launch capabilities, and enhanced innovation through internal R&D and business development actions. These deliberate efforts continue to solidify Pfizer's ability to overcome upcoming LOEs and drive sustainable revenue growth all while enhancing long-term shareholder value. To further support our long-term growth objectives, we are executing a capital allocation strategy designed to effectively deploy our cash. Our strategy is focused on three main pillars: first is reinvesting in our business; second is growing our dividends over time; and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first half of 2023 alone, we've invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D; returned $4.6 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed acquisition of Seagen. During the second quarter, Pfizer successfully completed a $31 billion unsecured debt offering across 8 tranches. The net proceeds of this debt offering will be used to substantially fund the Seagen acquisition. The new debt carries a weighted average yield of 4.93% and a weighted average maturity of 16.3 years, consistent with our expectations. On a full year run rate basis, the annual financing cost associated with the acquisition is expected to be nearly $2 billion. With the completion now of this debt offering, the company is now positioned to close the Seagen acquisition immediately upon post regulatory approvals. While we plan to continue investing in our business, we expect to de-lever our capital structure following the closing of Seagen transaction. As we de-lever it is our expectation to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy inclusive of share repurchases. Now, with that, let me briefly cover a few highlights of our quarterly financial performance. As Albert said, our Q2 results were solid and in line with our expectations from both a top and bottom-line perspective, albeit slightly better than EPS consensus. As expected in our guidance, our overall Q2 revenues declined 53% operationally. The contraction of revenues was driven by the anticipated decline in Paxlovid and Comirnaty sales. We expect these products to transition to a commercial market in the second half of this year. Our operational revenue growth excluding our COVID products was in line with expectations at 5% versus Q2 of LY, with strong contributions from the inclusion of Nurtec and Oxbryta, as well as the continued growth from the Vyndaqel family. During Q2, adjusted SI&A expenses were $3.4 billion and grew 20% operationally versus LY. We continue to invest in support of our upcoming launches and grow our recently acquired products. While it's clear that these near-term investments are dampening our current profitability levels, we are laser-focused on maximizing the longer-term performance of these products. Now, moving to the bottom line, reported diluted EPS this quarter declined by 77% to $0.41, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 declined 65% on an operational basis. Earnings compressed at a greater rate than revenues, primarily due to the steep and anticipated contraction in Paxlovid sales during the quarter. Once again, foreign exchange movements continued to unfavorably impact our results, reducing second quarter revenues by approximately $280 million, or 1%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05, or 2%, compared to last year. Now that we are at the halfway point of our 2023 financial plan, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on how we are executing across our business while navigating within an incredibly unique and dynamic environment. As a management team, we remain committed to transparency and sharing our assessment of the evolving marketplace given the magnitude of launches; the ongoing shifting nature of the COVID landscape; and the continued integration of acquired assets. Let me begin by elaborating on our full-year 2023 financial guidance. We are narrowing our expectations for revenues to between $67 billion to $70 billion and maintaining guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45 for the full year. For our more durable and predictable non-COVID revenues, we are updating our guidance range to 6% to 8% operational revenue growth. From a launch timing standpoint, I'll point out that the majority of our 2023 launches are anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 and our commercialization schedule remains materially unchanged. As a company, we always strive to achieve the highest revenue level possible while maintaining a realistic view of key inputs that inform our outlook. Regarding RSV for older adults, the shared decision-making recommendation by ACIP is likely to slow its uptake in the U.S. In addition, the recent approval of Talzenna in the U.S. results in a more narrow patient population than originally planned. These factors coupled with the impact of the damaged Rocky Mount manufacturing facility presents near-term revenue challenges. However, we expect positive revenue momentum as we exit 2023 and head into 2024. Importantly, the long-term outlook for our non-COVID business remains intact relative to our 2030 ambitions. Turning now to our less predictable and more variable COVID portfolio. Year-to-date we have booked slightly over 40% of the $21.5 billion full-year revenue forecast for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid with the important fall vaccination and respiratory infection season ahead of us. We are acutely aware that COVID demand depends on many evolving market variables making the range of potential revenue outcomes increasingly large and difficult to predict with certainty. These variables include overall levels of vaccination and infection rates; the speed of draw-down of government inventory levels; and the mutating nature of the virus itself, just to name a few. In the interest of public health and with the important fall season ahead of us, we are maintaining our COVID revenue outlook for the year while continuing to invest, largely on a variable expense basis, to support our COVID products in 2023. These variable investments are important to support our efforts to reach as many patients as possible, helping to ensure the most at-risk individuals are both vaccinated and treated while maintaining our leading market share. We are proud of what we have achieved through the COVID portfolio, and this has allowed the Company to invest in support of its growth agenda for the back half of this decade. Our visibility into future COVID revenues and demands should improve through the remainder of 2023, as we gain clarity on a more typical annual revenue run-rate. We are well aware that our 2023 profit outlook is currently being dampened by incremental costs in support of our launches, as well as higher R&D investments aligned with the Company's current revenue base. We remain committed to both defending and growing our overall level of profitability. As Albert mentioned earlier, we expect this fall's performance of our COVID-19 products to help us more effectively forecast future sales performance. To that end, if our COVID-19 revenues are less than what we have assumed, we are prepared to launch an enterprise-wide cost improvement program aligned with the longer-term revenue projections for our business. This program would be designed to support our objective of growing our operating profit margin and we would expect it to begin to yield results in 2024. We look forward to sharing specific details of this program in our upcoming earnings calls. In closing, this is an extraordinary time for Pfizer. Our confidence and our commitment to our strategy and to achieving our 2030 goals is unwavering. We will continue to focus our efforts to drive growth while enhancing long-term shareholder value. And with that, let me now turn it over to Mikael. Yes. So, great question. As we think about our operating margin long term, clearly, our objective is to expand that over time. Clearly, it is our expectation to get back to, at a minimum, pre-COVID levels with one caveat is that we -- as we go forward, we do have a different mix of products within our portfolio, particularly the vaccine related to COVID. As you know that the vaccine, given the cost share that we have or profit share that we have with our partner, does dilute that product from an operating margin perspective. So a mix adjusted, you should see us back to those levels over time. But obviously, as we cycle into \u201824, we'll give you a lot more clarity on all the puts and takes as we integrate Seagen, as we roll forward from a COVID franchise perspective, how that looks as well as all the developments that we have coming out the pipeline at this point in time. Yes. So, thank you for the question. Clearly, as we develop this program in the back half of \u201823, we look forward to sharing a lot more details as we cycle into \u201824 and give you a lot of, I'll say, milestones as you think about both our cost and investment structure going forward. Importantly, as you know, we're extremely excited about the Seagen acquisition that's upcoming here. Upon approval, this will allow the Company to refocus its efforts and its investments to make sure that we're squarely focused on battling cancer going forward. And we think there's a big opportunity as we align our resources against that franchise in that battle to fight cancer and an opportunity for patients and importantly, an opportunity long term for Pfizer. Having said that, we will be informed in the back half of the year of our revenue performance, specifically as it relates to COVID. That will inform us the level of opportunity we have to expand our margins into \u201824 and \u201825 and beyond. That will allow us to step back and make sure that all of our costs, all our investments are aligned with those Seagen objectives as well as aligned to maximizing the performance of our in-line portfolio as well as the launches that are occurring as we speak in the back half of this year. So, again, we look forward to sharing a lot more to this from this. This will be balanced, as you well know between SI&A and R&D, and we'll give you that specific breakdown and that specific information later this year and into next year."

            "content": "Thanks for the question, Carter. And obviously, I'm not going to comment on the rumors and speculation or the potential prices attached to different transactions. What I will say is we're very pleased with our TL1A Telavant partnership with Roivant and we do think shareholders were well served. So, as a reminder, why we entered this? We entered this as an R&D portfolio prioritization decision. So from time to time, we make decisions as part of our disciplined process to our partner R&D programs, where we think it is better to share the risk or the cost with a partner. And in this case, Telavant covers all of the R&D costs going forward. And that frees up significant R&D capacity for Pfizer to invest in high priority programs. But we still retained value in this program in three different ways. We had a 25% equity stake in Telavant. We have full ex U.S. and ex Japan rights and we earned royalties on the U.S. and Japan sales. So, taken together, this collaboration allows us to keep more than 50% of the total value of TL1A with zero incremental R&D spend. And for a Phase 2 program, we feel this is a very sound move for Pfizer shareholders."

            "name": "Dr. Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Today, I will provide updates from a few different therapeutic focus areas, starting with breast cancer. We are working to deliver the next wave of innovative therapies for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The pillars of this strategy are three-fold: establishing our investigational CDK4 inhibitor as a next-generation cell cycle therapy backbone, establishing vepdegestrant as a next-generation endocrine therapy backbone and establishing novel mechanisms like our investigational CDK2 inhibitor and KAT6 inhibitor candidates as next-gen combination partners to enhance efficacy. Our clinical strategy entails first developing assets for the metastatic setting in which Ibrance is currently the leader and unmet need is high, followed by an opportunity to expand to earlier-stage breast cancer including the CDK4/6-nai\u0308ve population and adjuvant/neoadjuvant settings. Data presented at ASCO from three key investigational medicines from our next-gen portfolio demonstrated anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated populations of patients with breast cancer. As a reminder, the majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia which requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition. Across the CDK4/6 inhibitor class, approximately 30% to 60% of patients experience severe neutropenia. On the left: In a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER 2-negative breast cancer, all of whom had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, treatment with our CDK4 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 29%, clinical benefit response rate of 52% and median progression free survival of nearly 25 weeks. The combination was well-tolerated, which may enable maximal CDK4 inhibition. We are actively planning the Phase 3 randomized study. In addition, I'd like to highlight encouraging data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study of our novel CDK2 inhibitor which showed monotherapy activity, including confirmed partial responses, in breast cancer patients who had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Also, durable confirmed clinical responses were observed in a Phase 1 trial of our novel KAT6 inhibitor as a monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer. Turning now to blood cancers, Elrexfio, also known as elranatamab, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be the anchor of an anticipated multi-billion-dollar franchise. An FDA decision for the potential first indication in the triple-class relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population is expected this year, and we continue to advance the MagnetisMM clinical programs to expand into earlier lines of treatment. In addition, the development of maplirpacept, also known as TTI-622, is underway, including in combination with Elrexfio, to support potential indications in myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we show Elrexfio data presented at EHA from the MagnetisMM-3 trial in patients with triple-class refractory multiple myeloma who had no prior exposure to BCMA-directed therapy. On the left, we observed highly meaningful survival with Elrexfio monotherapy, with a 15-month overall survival of 57%. In patients who achieved a complete response, 15-month survival was remarkably 93%, underscoring the potential for deep and durable responses. We can see evidence of broad activity in multiple myeloma on the right, with the graph showing a single agent complete response rate of 35%, which rises to 46% in the subset of patients with two to three prior lines of therapy. Our ongoing randomized trials are in less pretreated to newly diagnosed populations. Subject to approval, Elrexfio may have key differentiators such as 50% lower hospitalization time during the step-up dosing period per protocol and an extended dosing interval that moves from once weekly to once every other week dosing beyond week 24. Turning now to hemophilia A and B, the pivotal trial of marstacimab met its primary endpoints, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on annualized bleeding rate, or ABR. There was a 35% reduction in ABR compared to prophylactic factor replacement and 92% reduction in ABR versus ondemand factor replacement. Marstacimab offers a differentiated mechanism of action and dosing regimen compared to standard-of-care therapy. If approved, it has the potential to be the first once-weekly subcutaneous hemophilia B treatment for patients without inhibitors, and the first hemophilia A or B treatment administered in a patient-friendly pen as a flat dose. Regulatory submission is expected in the second half of 2023. Next, Litfulo, also known as ritlecitinib, is the first medicine to receive FDA approval to treat severe alopecia areata in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It also recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's CHMP recommending body but is not yet approved. It has the potential to redefine the standard of care for alopecia areata. Litfulo is a first-of-its-kind kinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism that inhibits both the TEC kinase family and transiently JAK3, pathways that have been implicated in the alopecia areata pathophysiology. In addition, we are exploring how its unique mechanism of action could potentially be applied across immune disorders including vitiligo, in which a Phase 3 study is ongoing, and other potential indications. Finally, we are making excellent progress on the milestones we had set out through the first half of 2024. As Albert noted, we recently received FDA approval for Prevnar 20 in the pediatric population. We have robust strategies in place to potentially improve the protection provided by current pneumococcal vaccines. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters. In addition, we recently published Phase 2 data in the New England Journal of Medicine showing our Group B Streptococcus maternal vaccine candidate was generally well-tolerated and generated robust antibody levels. The journal also published a natural history study which was used to determine protective antibody levels at birth. These two studies indicated that the vaccine candidate may offer meaningful protection to infants born to immunized mothers. We were highly encouraged that Dr. Carol Baker, an infectious disease expert from the University of Texas Health Science Center, wrote an independent NEJM editorial highlighting the important future prospects of our GBS vaccine candidate. The progress of the GBS vaccine candidate dovetails nicely with the positive results and anticipated upcoming regulatory decisions for our RSV vaccine Abrysvo for administration to pregnant women. Abrysvo recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's CHMP for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. Abrysvo is approved for older adults in the U.S. and under regulatory review for the maternal indication. In addition, we remain excited to see Phase 2 data from danuglipron by end of 2023, which we expect will enable us to finalize our Phase 3 plans. Finally, I'll call out the Phase 3 trial start of our anti-interferon Beta candidate for the treatment of inflammatory muscle myopathies, which has received a Fast Track Designation from FDA. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. Well, we really look forward to get the data. And as you know, we have in parallel developed activities also for modified leads. I think we really need to look at the totality of data, its performance on important metabolic parameters in diabetes, its ability to deliver weight loss as you alluded to, and also, of course, its tolerability in general. These three implicate how well the drug can perform. And I remain optimistic that oral drugs in this class can have a profound effect on weight loss. Of course, one needs to be maybe a little bit caution to drive weight loss too far, as you have seen also some concerns in public media about side effects that may arise from that. So we will really integrate all of that data and make a decision, and we really look forward to that moment. Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks, we expect data at the later part of this year. We are absolutely encouraged and confident that it has a different profile when it comes to adverse events as the danuglipron that we sold. So we don't see that as an issue. And I spoke to that we will put together the totality of data to pending readout, prepare a potential Phase 3 program. And it's a very big sector, diabetes and obesity. We have considerable expertise in treating cardiometabolic patients. So, we look forward to share more data and more plans with you as we move to further quarter. Thank you for your great interest in this important space. Yes. First, the totality of experience we have with mRNA for flu makes me very encouraged that this will be new modality as it was for COVID but now for flu, that engages two mechanisms, the B-cells and the T-cell that we should aspire for, having better efficacy than what we have seen with the old flu. We are continuing with the study because we just wanted to have more events and particularly have additional flu B type of events, which were scarce in the U.S. part of the trial. And we look forward to update you, hopefully, be able to conclude the study later this year. But we also are putting mitigations as adding immunogenicity studies that can be supplementary for getting a total good data package of activity against flu A and flu B. But as I said, I remain very optimistic that the mRNA is going to be the next important platform to deal with flu. I hear your interest in a once-daily product, and I would say I don't see any technical barrier for us in creating that. We have tremendous experience in modified release formulations. And our early data, as we now have initiated a while ago, tells us we should be encouraged that when it relates to once-a-day modified release for danuglipron, I believe we will have such a formulation in a reasonable future in our hands. When could it come to the market if the drug continues and makes a great Phase 3? Well, I think we can have it at launch or shortly after launch. So I wouldn't worry about that. But I agree with you that once-daily modified release can sometimes actually improve the tolerability profile by a slew than the variability and exposure, which typically reduce GI side effects that have been seen as limiting this drug. So that's why I can see a potential twofold advantage of MR goes from twice a day to once a day and may also help uniquely to create a tolerability profile within the structure of GLPs. [Ph] DMD gene therapy, I'm encouraged that FDA took a very positive angle on that drug when it comes to its urgency to get into the market. Chris, you and I have worked very closely on that, and we expect today we'll look relatively soon to conclude the trial. I'll also ask Chris to pitch in on it. I'm very excited about marstacimab. I followed this projects for a long time. And as you know, we reported our very encouraging data. We had 92% reduction in annual bleeding rate versus on demand. We had really no safety events as had been associated with other products, including Hemlibra. It's active against both in A and B. It's administrated with a pre-fill pen. I think it can be, from a medical point of view, a very large product, a single option for hemophilia A and B. Of course, when I think about how Hemlibra has been such a promise for in A patient and I see this profile that it's so good, I'm optimistic that it can do well in both segments. Aamir, said it well. And I just wanted to punctuate among the very many options, we have a strong platform in bispecific in many therapeutic, including in immunology and we do have TL1A antibody. That would be very interesting, where we own an even greater share. We have triple specifics that are going into atopic dermatitis. So it just punctuates. Even in the very same therapeutic area, we have so many things going on. And near term, we expect soon approval for etrasimod and another readout [indiscernible]. So a lot to start there. Well, I think the difference between maybe the pioneering mRNA companies Pfizer and of course there is Moderna that have worked on this technology in many years. We have ourselves been 5 years into it and make ample improvement across the entire mRNA chain. And I think it just gives us a big leg up and an what experience we had with COVID vaccine. So, I can't really comment on the issues that Sanofi are facing. I share a much more positive -- I have a much more positive outlook that we have in our capability to design mRNA vaccines that will be powerful against flu A and also against flu B. And let's wait as we accumulate data and see the outcome. But, I'm optimistic about that and realize it's a field that requires a lot of capability to enter. The flu reactogenicity has actually been moderate, been really good. So, that's not an issue at all at end of the doses that we have been testing in young or older patients."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "Sure. So first of all, we're really excited about the approval for our RSV older adult vaccine. And the way I would see this shared clinical decision-making is just that it is a step towards the full routine recommendation that we anticipate, so. And I think that there is -- the way to look at it is that it's a short-term effect. We do expect that with more data that will emerge -- be emerging out of our clinical program, that we'll have an additional opportunity to go back to the ACIP and actually get the routine recommendation that we hope for. So, over the next year or so, as we collect and finalize our data, that is really the anticipation of it. So, it doesn't change the full opportunity for this particular vaccine. It doesn't change the peak. It just means that it takes us a little bit longer to get to the peak because of the shared clinical decision-making that -- that extra step that we have to take right now. Ex-U.S., actually, we had a different filing. We were able to get both maternal and older adult at the same time. So I think you see slightly different dynamics there and that here in the U.S., our maternal vaccine will be launching later. But in ex-U.S. and in Europe, they will be launching at the same time. And those vaccine technical committees have not opined yet on those recommendations, in particular in terms of the utilization. And so, we'll await that. But I think what you have that's different and that's really a great upside is the fact that we have both indications at once. Louise, I think when you talk about Vyndamax or Vyndaqel, the biggest and our biggest differentiator that we're extremely confident about is just the totality of our data really along four dimensions. And whether that's clinical data or real-world data, we have all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalization data. Our data is also relevant in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM, so that's unique. We've also demonstrated significant survival benefit at five years through our real-world data. So whichever way you look at it and you compare that with any competitor program, I think that we have a highly differentiated and an extremely valuable molecule that stacks up well against any competition. Well, I mean, I want to begin by just saying how I'm incredibly proud we are of the performance of the entire Prevnar franchise. If you look at the adult indication, we have grown -- not only have we grown 23% since last year this time, we are doing all of this growth prior to the fall vaccination season, which is what you typically see. So the fact that we've been able to bring these vaccinations will tell us a lot about the work that we've done in pneumococcal disease, how well appreciated it is, but also how well our machinery is working, not to mention the fact that we have 96% share of the adult indication. In peds also, of course, being that we went from 100% of the market, today, we share some of that market share with PCV15. But I just want to remind everyone that that is to be expected, and we are exactly where we thought we would be. And so from that perspective, we're also really proud of how Prevnar 13 has competed with PCV15. I think the important thing here to realize is that given the ACIP recommendation that we've just got for Prevnar peds what we are beginning to see now is a sort of reversal of that decline and the reclaiming of market share. And so, we have -- the fact that we've seen some accounts purchasing PCV20 peds now, we've seen some account switching from PCV15 to our own Prevnar 20, the fact that our federal contracts had added Prevnar 20 to their register, which means that public vaccinations can begin. And then maybe the one thing I will mention about Prevnar peds, which is unique compared to any other pneumococcal vaccine, which is that we were given the recommendations to vaccinate -- well, kids 2 to 18 immunocompromised. So that is a whole new population that we've never had before. So, when you kind of bring all of this together and you factor that this quarter alone, Prevnar franchise generated $1.3 billion in revenue, just this one quarter, I think that order of magnitude gives you a sense of the scale and the competitiveness of our portfolio, and we're really excited about what Prevnar can do over the next coming quarters. Yes. Well, it is, as you say, an incredibly important product, and we're just so proud of the fact that it's still growing 40-something percent this quarter. I think when it comes to LOEs, just from the perspective of how we see it, our composition of matter at patent expires in 2024, but we are -- patent term extensions that get us through December of 2028; in the EU, it's 2026; in Japan, it goes right up to 2029. So actually, I feel like we still have a good runway as it pertains to this product, more diagnoses that we need to do and more patients that we can capture on to Vyndaqel, especially with the incredibly competitive and differentiated profile that we have. As you say, we're always, and working with Aamir, looking at opportunities as to what might be good fit into what might fit well into this franchise in this portfolio. But I guess from my perspective, with or without it, we see an incredibly strong opportunity for us to continue to capture growth. Yes, sure. So, that's exactly right, Albert. I think there's just -- it's a new policy and lots to understand in terms of how it's going to play out. As you say, there will be price negotiations, but at the same time, I think that what we also have to remember, Andrew, is that there's a mitigating factor of the fact that more patients likely will be able to get on Eliquis because of the co-pay threshold and that sort of cap we're going to have as a function of IRA. And so, I think it's a dynamic situation. There's a lot for us to consider as it pertains to pricing, rebates, but also patient utilization of the drug and all of this will play out. I guess, as it pertains specifically also to Eliquis, just to remind everyone that those obviously one of our largest drugs, its LOE will be around that \u201826 time frame. So, whatever the impact is, will not be long lasting on our portfolio because it's losing patent anyway around that time."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Pfizer's first quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceuticals Business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. William Pao, our Chief Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was a solid, foundational quarter in what we expect to be an exciting year for Pfizer and patients. Our financial results were as we anticipated. Our non-COVID revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter, while overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily due to a previously communicated and expected decline in Comirnaty revenues. Even with Comirnaty's decline, our COVID franchises remained significant contributors to the business with a combined $7.1 billion in revenues during the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by recently acquired products, Nurtec for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease, our anti-infective Sulperazon, Eliquis, in the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the U.S., and our Vyndaqel family of products for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy ATTR-CM. We also continue to be proud of our patient impact. During the first quarter, more than 250 million patients were treated with our medicines and vaccines. With this solid start to the year, we remain on track to grow our non-COVID revenues by 7% to 9% operationally in 2023. That's because the majority of our potential near-term product launches, as you can see mapped out on this slide, are expected to occur in the second half of the year, following regulatory approvals where not yet secured. As such, we expect our non-COVID revenues to grow at a faster rate in the second half of the year than in the first. Overall, we are in the midst of an 18-month period in which we expect to launch up to 19 potential new products and indications. Over the first four months of the year, we have made excellent progress toward this goal with the approval of Zavzpret, an expanded indication for Cibinqo to include adolescents, and last week's approval of Prevnar 20 for pediatric use, all in the U.S. We also have secured regulatory filing acceptances for elranatamab, for Braftovi and Mektovi for non-small cell lung cancer, and for our RSV maternal vaccine candidate, which if approved would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth through six months. In addition, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has granted priority review and the European Medicines Agency has accepted our MAA filing for review of Talzenna for use in combination with Xtandi for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, based on the TALAPRO2 results. Regarding our COVID-19 franchises, we continue to expect 2023 to be a transition year as the virus continues to mutate and we move from advance purchases under government contracts to more traditional supply arrangements in a commercial model for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. As previously discussed, in 2023 and 2024 we expect vaccine utilization to decline compared with 2022. Then starting in 2025 and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of various COVID combination vaccines. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar -- with some variations from country-to-country. Regarding Paxlovid, we continue to expect the government inventory that was built around the world last year to be absorbed by the end of this year. We then expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the courses sold and courses used will more closely align. With its robust efficacy, consistent safety profile, and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID-19 on patients and their families, health systems and society, Paxlovid is proving to be an important and durable complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40% of the global adult population at high risk for progressing to severe disease. Now let's take a look at Pfizer's next potential moonshot: the battle against cancer. Oncology remains a core therapeutic area for Pfizer, and we believe the proposed acquisition of Seagen will enhance our position in this important space. Integration planning is already underway, and we continue to expect the deal to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. By combining Seagen's category-leading antibody-drug conjugate technology with Pfizer's scale, expertise and capabilities, we believe we can accelerate potential breakthroughs in cancer medicines and introduce new solutions to patients around the world. The potential combined commercial infrastructure for Pfizer and Seagen will be 3x the size of that of Seagen alone in the U.S. and 4x, 5x larger globally. As a result, we believe acquiring Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 risk-adjusted revenues, with potential significant growth beyond 2030. Even with the Seagen deal, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, we continue to have the flexibility to take additional actions to create shareholder value. Dave will provide more details on this during his presentation. One of the key areas of focus for Pfizer in 2023 is continuing to build trust, which is a key asset for every biopharmaceuticals company. Since the beginning of the year, we have received two accolades that demonstrate we are doing just that. In February, Pfizer was named to the Top 10 of Fortune's Most Admired Companies List for the second year in a row. And in March, Ethisphere recognized Pfizer as one of the world's most ethical companies, also for the second year in a row. At Pfizer, trust is everything. It gives us our license to operate, allows us to attract the best talent and enables us to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave?\nDave Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin with Pfizer's capital allocation strategy before we dive into additional commentary about our quarterly performance and outlook for the remainder of 2023. As you know our strategy includes three pillars: reinvesting in the business; growing and paying dividends; and repurchasing our shares. In the first three months of 2023, we have invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and importantly, allocated approximately $43 billion for the proposed Seagen acquisition. Over the last few years, we have reinvested heavily into our business to drive long-term growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. We have invested in Pfizer's own science, while acquiring the best external science to supplement our pipeline. Since 2022, we've invested approximately $70 billion, including Seagen, in business development. In addition, we have continued to grow our dividend. For the past 14 years, we have raised our dividend annually. Since 2010, our quarterly cash dividend grew from $0.16 a share to $0.41 a share in 2023. Looking ahead, as we exit this unprecedented period of anticipated launches, we would expect to achieve margin improvement over time. As we begin to de-lever our capital structure after the closing of the Seagen transaction, we expect to return to a more balanced capital allocation mix between our three pillars. While we will continue to invest in our business, we do expect more balance between that priority and returning value to our shareholders via increased dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy is squarely focused on driving shareholder value while at the same time remaining committed to a high investment grade Tier 1 commercial paper rating. Now turning to the quarter, as Albert said, our results were in line with our expectations, albeit slightly better than consensus. As expected, overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in Comirnaty, which was partially offset by strong Paxlovid sales. I want to point out that our COVID-19 products produced $7.1 billion in revenues in the first quarter alone. Our non-COVID operational revenue growth was solid at 5% year-over-year. Primarily driving this growth was the inclusion of Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta, and an increase in Sulperazon revenues in China. Revenues for Eliquis in the U.S. and the Vyndaqel family globally also contributed to this growth. Now, I want to remind you of the seasonality of some of our products. In the first-quarter, Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta typically have lower sales quarter-on-quarter due to annual copay reset dynamics, with higher sales anticipated in later quarters. Most important, both products continue to experience strong growth in demand. Sulperazon revenues increased more than $100 million year-over-year, due to higher demand in China during the quarter, which we do not expect to be sustained going forward. The demand was due to increased bacterial infections from more patients being hospitalized for COVID. To help ensure the success of the expected launches of our large number of new and acquired products and indications, we increased our investments in SI&A. These investments are squarely focused on Pfizer's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. Moving to the bottom-line, reported diluted EPS this quarter declined by 29% to $0.97, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.23 declined 20% on an operational basis during the quarter. Once again this quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing first quarter revenues by $730 million, or 3%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.07, or 4%, compared to LY. Now turning to the full year financial outlook for the Company, our full year 2023 guidance remains unchanged. On a total company basis, we continue to expect revenues of $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. With 5% operational growth in our non-COVID revenues this quarter, we are on-track to achieve our non-COVID revenue guidance of 7% to 9% operational growth for the full year. Given that a large number of launches are expected to occur in the third and fourth quarter of 2023, we anticipate our quarterly revenues will not be linear this year and that our non-COVID revenues will grow more quickly in the back half of the year versus the first half of 2023. In terms of our COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we expect sales to trend more seasonally in this year. Given these dynamics, we expect significantly lower sales contributions from our COVID products in the second quarter versus the first quarter. In fact, given the anticipated timing of approvals for a fall vaccine with strain change, we would expect more substantial vaccine deliveries to start in September, which is late in the U.S. third quarter and the beginning of our international fourth quarter. With respect to Paxlovid, we continue to expect 2023 to be a transitional year as we anticipate shifting to a commercial market in the second half of this year. We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. On a full year basis, we expect that foreign exchange will have an unfavorable impact compared with full year 2022 of approximately $0.13, on adjusted diluted earnings per share. We are also reaffirming the remaining components of our full year 2023 guidance, which you can find in the Appendix of the Q1 2023 earnings presentation. So in closing, this is an exciting period for Pfizer as we continue to invest to drive long-term growth and importantly enhance long-term shareholder value. With that, now let me turn it over to Mikael.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Thank you, Dave. Today I\u2019d like to start off with one of the four pillars of our oncology portfolio, which are breast, urogenital, blood cancers and precision medicine. Within urogenital, prostate cancer is an area in which we have strong momentum. Recent positive study results further strengthen our franchise, building upon the global standard of care set by XTANDI, and underscoring our long-standing commitment to the pursuit of breakthroughs that define new standards of care in prostate cancer. I\u2019ll highlight data from two Phase 3 studies, EMBARK and TALAPRO-2, as well as early, but promising signals from our EZH2 inhibitor, each of which has the potential to reach broader patient populations across the treatment continuum in prostate cancer. Final analysis from TALAPRO-2, evaluating our potential blockbuster PARP inhibitor TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI were presented at ASCO GU. Results showed significant and clinically meaningful improvement across the all-comers population in radiographic progression free survival, or rPFS, in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutations. There was a 37% reduction in risk of disease progression. Median rPFS in patients treated with TALZENNA and XTANDI was not reached at the time of analysis versus 21.9 months for placebo plus XTANDI. A trend in overall survival favoring TALZENNA plus XTANDI was also observed, though these data are immature. The final OS data will be reported once the predefined number of survival events has been reached. Treatment with TALZENNA and XTANDI resulted in statistically significant improvement in overall response rates, which suggest a potential cooperative effect between the two treatments. The U.S. FDA has granted Priority Review for our sNDA for TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, with a decision expected in 2023. The ongoing TALAPRO-3 study, if successful, may further expand the reach of this potential blockbuster into the HRR-deficient metastatic castration sensitive population. We recently presented data from our Phase 3 EMBARK study evaluating XTANDI plus leuprolide in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence at the American Urological Association's 2023 Annual Meeting. The study met its primary endpoint with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in metastasis-free survival, with a 58% reduction in risk for radiographic progression or death. Key secondary endpoints were met including time to PSA progression. These results suggest XTANDI, the only novel hormone therapy approved for three disease states of prostate cancer in the U.S., has the potential if approved to expand to patients in the hormone-sensitive, or castration sensitive setting, for the first time. Next, I'd like to share early data from one of our next-wave candidates, a potential first-in-class and best-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, which we shorthand as 1497. EZH2 is an epigenetic transcriptional repressor that is frequently over expressed in prostate cancer. We believe that inhibition of EZH2 may provide synergistic effects in combination with XTANDI, with the potential to address unmet needs of patients with androgen-sensitive and resistant disease. Here are data from our ongoing Phase 1/2 study evaluating \u20181497 in second line mCRPC patients with prior abiraterone and/or XTANDI, and up to one line of chemotherapy. On the left are updated data from a Phase 1 dose escalation study shared at ESMO last year. These encouraging results show durable anti-tumor activity in both XTANDI-na\u00efve and experienced patients, with all XTANDI-na\u00efve patients having received prior abiraterone. Importantly, this suggests that the addition of our EZH2 inhibitor has the potential to sensitize XTANDI resistant tumors, which is an increasing clinical unmet need. The early rPFS data are also highly encouraging, reaching 8.7 months in the XTANDI experienced patients. and 17.1 months in XTANDI-na\u00efve both of which are notably longer than historical controls. For example, in the control arm of the CARD study, rPFS for XTANDI alone was 4.8 months in XTANDI-na\u00efve patients. And although cross-trial comparisons cannot be made, these results, in combination with the emerging objective response rate and PSA50 response, are supportive of the contribution of our EZH2 inhibitor candidate in driving these responses. From a safety perspective, the combination was generally well tolerated, with mostly Grade 1 and 2 events. The randomized Phase 2 study in second line mCRPC is ongoing, with data expected in early 2024. Now, we turn to the potential for near-term growth across our respiratory vaccine franchise. Prevnar 20, our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is now approved for children aged 6 weeks through 17 years. We are confident in our ability to maintain leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space with Prevnar 20, which offers the broadest serotype coverage of any pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, helping to protect against the 20 serotypes in the vaccine. We have strong momentum with our RSV vaccine candidate, having received a positive VRBPAC Committee vote supporting potential approval to help combat RSV in older adults and PDUFA dates for our Older Adult and Maternal indications in quick succession in the coming months. Just last month, the New England Journal of Medicine published results from the two positive Phase 3 studies. Emerging data from the middle of the second RSV season in the Northern Hemisphere in the Phase 3 Older Adult study support meaningful durable vaccine efficacy; we will share the data once complete. In the coming months, we plan to start a Phase 3 study of the RSV vaccine candidate in 18- to 60-year-olds at high risk for RSV and in immunocompromised adults 18 and over, and a Phase 1 study in 2 to 18-year-olds at high risk, with the potential to broadly expand the reach of our vaccine candidate both to those aged 18 to 60 with high-risk conditions as well as to pediatrics and adolescents. Our RSV-Flu co-administration study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority for all four flu strains and RSV A and B strains. This suggests the RSV vaccine candidate, if approved, could be co-administered with flu vaccinations and add an important component of seasonal protection against respiratory pathogens. Finally, the FDA recently updated the EUA for our Omicron BA.4/5 bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to enable those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness, including the elderly and the immunocompromised, to partner with their healthcare providers to be proactive in helping protect themselves against COVID-19. We anticipate another update from FDA in June that will provide guidance on COVID-19 vaccine strains and vaccination timing for the 2023 fall and winter seasons. Beyond vaccines, anti-virals are an important component of our strategy in respiratory viruses. Here we share data for the first time from our second generation oral COVID-19 antiviral candidate, a potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor that is currently in Phase 1. We designed this candidate to achieve clinical exposures that would have similar anti-viral activity to PAXLOVID, but without the need for ritonavir boosting and with the potential for reduced drug interactions. Early results from Phase 1 dose escalation are encouraging, with no dose limiting safety or tolerability findings. Dosing achieved concentrations many-fold over in vitro EC90 and is therefore expected to have similar antiviral activity to PAXLOVID. On the right are preliminary results from a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of midazolam drug interaction, which is a well-known standard for indicating CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions. These data show there is a lack of such drug-drug interactions, suggesting there may be no related restrictions of co-dosing with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. Based on these encouraging data, we are planning to advance to a Phase 2 dose ranging study in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we continue to make progress on the pipeline with more than 25 milestones recently achieved or anticipated through the first half of 2024. In inflammation & immunology, the FDA has approved our sNDA for CIBINQO, enabling a label expansion for adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In internal medicine, ZAVZPRET migraine nasal spray has received FDA approval, expanding our migraine portfolio. Recently, the FDA Advisory Committee voted in support of PAXLOVID\u2019s favorable benefit-risk profile, with a soon PDUFA date in May. In closing, we are very excited about the potentially transformative catalysts expressed across the pipeline as we work with continued urgency to bring breakthroughs to patients. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\nChris Stevo: Thank you, Mikael. All right, Chelsea, please queue up the list for Q&A. We have at least 30 minutes for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer, your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: I have two here, if I may. First, your expectations on the system eligible in the EV--302 trial especially because it's so significant to the acquisition you are going on to track on? And then secondly, based on my\u2026\nDr. Albert Bourla: Umer, can you repeat the question, I'm not sure we understood it.\nUmer Raffat: Sure. On the Seagen trial on Pfizer EV--302, I know there's been a huge emphasis on cohort K, which is at this time ineligibles. My question is, this ongoing trial also has says plan eligibles, which is two thirds of the target population. What's your expectation there? Because it was I felt like it was not a coincidence, you never showed any data disclosure from the eligible part A? And secondly, for the guidance for the full year, I noticed there's perhaps $1 billion or so worth of contribution from new launches. And I'm just trying to make sense of that in light of the fact that these are going to be launches, sort of in fall of this year, I realized that important read like RSV, route map, but is it reasonable to expect a billion dollars or so or lean to the launch from those? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes, thank you very much. Angela, why don't we take the second question about the guidance --p about the 1 billion estimated sales in the last quarter.\nAngela Hwang: So from a launch perspective, I think the two big ones to look out for this year are Prevnar 20 EPS, and RSP adults. And as you know, it goes through the typical ACIP process or recommendation, and then launches can really only happen or commercialization after the publication of the MWR. So if you consider all of that, that puts us into fourth quarter, which is when Prevnar 20, as well as when RSV older adults will actually be commercialized, and revenue being generated. And so yes, we are anticipating that there's going to be a big bolus of revenue because, first of all, if you think about Prevnar 20 Peds, that is going to be a conversion from Prevnar 20 Peds and Prevnar 13 today has a significant market share, right, in the pediatric pneumococcal, is 80% margin share. So, we are going to be converting those accounts, the physicians, the inventory, all of that from 13 over to 20. And so if you look at, I guess a good analog for that would be our Prevnar 20 adult launch, which was the conversion of the Prevnar 20 adult launch, and there it went really well. Today, we have what, over 95 market share. And then of course the second one is the RSV adult, and there, it plugs into an already established commercial infrastructure that we have built around COVID, around the Prevnar franchise, the adult franchise. It comes at a great time during the fall and the winter when vaccinations for respiratory vaccines actually increases. So, there is a lot of reasons to believe why their fourth quarter and it'll be a really big quarter for both Prevnar Peds as well as RSV adults.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. On the question about the season asset although should be very careful, because we can't comment on that. But maybe you can make William, quick comment, general speaking.\nDr. William Pao: Yes, sure. I would say we are just very excited about the recent approval in the first line Seagen in eligible population, which Seagen has got, which is about 8,000 to 9,000 patients in the U.S., and we are excited to see additional data coming in first line Seagen eligible EV--302 study, which as you know is Peds plus Prevnar versus platinum gemcitabine. We can't comment any further as a Seagen. And if that positive, that would increase the eligible population by another 10,000 to 12,000.\nDr. Albert Bourla: No doubt, the population that excites us, but of course, we can comment on the Seagen products. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Evan. Your line is open. I think we will go to the next question. Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Evan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Terrific. Thanks for taking our call. This is Keith on for Evan. Maybe just shifting to M&A execution, thinking about your recent acquisitions with Nurtec and Oxbryta, you've done a great job describing the plans to add value to drive commercial and clinical synergies. We are seeing the outcomes on our end. Could you comment on how this is going from your end? And then could you talk about specifics for operationalizing the same for Seagen integration and how this would differ from recent examples? That would be great. Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Again, Angela back to you.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Yes. So we are incredibly proud of the work that we have done with Nurtec since the acquisition. As you know, in July of 2022, we had already begun and copromote with Biohaven to ensure that we were copromoting the product early. And I think that has really paid off. If you really look at what has happened from it, just leading indicators as well as actuals. Today, Nurtec is the leading product in the oral CGRP class with over 47.5% market share. It is also the leading product when it comes to new to brand prescription share at a high of 46%. It also has the highest number of prescribers at over 110,000 prescribers and 80% of new CGRP prescribers choose Nurtec. So, I think we've demonstrated in the time that we've had it, that we are able to drive performance and drive excellent education and awareness of the product. And we're seeing that consistent great metrics as it pertains to Nurtec. And of course, the opportunity is huge, right because we have so pan Japan launching later this year. And we also know that, as a whole, there are over 1 billion migraine sufferers and only 18% of them are using CRPS today. So, we have a great opportunity to expand the class of CGRP with specifically Nurtec.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: If I may ask two questions here. On European negotiation, just one -- because there was some news this week, just how much can you comment on that? And the real question there is that I know you when you provide guidance in the beginning of the year. You anticipated some of that, but so far as the negotiating reach to the guidance as a negotiation that finalized in that? And the other question I have is more about your demand chart for Paxlovid and vaccinations both, it seems like you are assuming both Paxlovid and vaccination, utilization going up into time 24 plus timeframe? Would it be both demand going demands going up? Or you think it will be either or as vaccinations come down, probably the demand for Paxlovid will would go up? How do you how should we think about that?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Maybe I can answer those questions. So, the EU negotiations, they are still ongoing. So, we can't comment on that. Yes, we can include part of -- included our estimation of how these negotiations will end up in our guidance. And still we are not close, so I can make any comment on that. It wouldn't be appropriate as the discussions are still ongoing. As regards the demand for Paxlovid or for vaccines, as we had said, we expect that the demand for vaccines will go down. We gave the estimations that will go down to approximately 24% of people in the U.S. and relevant numbers a different country by country as underlying demand that for boosters and things I think are progressing towards that goal, we will have to see as most of these will happen in the last in after summer, when it is the traditional period that flow is also vaccinations are happening. Demand for Paxlovid right now is following very, very accurately, the infection rates. So, when we monitor it on a weekly basis, and really it is going when we have almost equal percentage of infections is equal percentage of the case Paxlovid. So, we expect that we'll continue going like that because we have less compliance with the vaccination recommendations across the world as people are tired with COVID and we expect that fewer people, as I said this year will get the vaccine compared to last year. And so, this means that the immune protection of the population will go down. As a result, we expect that we will have more infections and that will drive more use of Paxlovid. But of course, that's what our logical models are telling us, we'll have to see what eventually will happen in real life. Thank you for your question. We may go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we have Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Just two big picture ones. Just first on for vaccine franchise, as we think about the competitive landscape. A couple of things, what do you think is going to be the most important differentiation for you versus the competition that will drive the most uptake as people have different options? And have you developed any new LNP technology that might reduce the biggest pushback with the vaccines as people still stick still when they got them for some of your products? And then lastly\u2026\nDr. Albert Bourla: I didn\u2019t hear which product you spoke about?\nRobyn Karnauskas: I was just talking about the [indiscernible] vaccine franchise for RSV and flu and COVID. Thinking big picture, how you are differentiated? And what do you think is going to be key because you're all competing to determine who's going to be the winner? And the second question is there's the big proposal at a Europe for new legislation for drugs. And since you're launching new products in Europe, just want to get your thoughts on whether or not you think that legislation may hold or what kind of impact that might have?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. And maybe I can give you a very general answer. And then if Angela wants to chime in, please. On the COVID, we are right now, all right, we have the big markets there. And then we plan to maintain that. So, I think we are then. When it comes to RSV, we are the only ones but we have both or we have positive data on both, on adults and on maternal. And we have already approved for the adults and then we are expecting approval for the maternal. So, that the strength of our data with efficacy and safety profile that we think is differentiated, will provide us with what we hope also to be the winners in that one. As flu on mRNA technology still the results, we are very optimistic with the totality of the data that we are having from our flu vaccine, and we will wait to see of course how that will continue. And then of course, the winners, there will be also those that they will be able to build from the maze of all of that. So, the fact that we have all three of them or we have a good chance to have all three of them, if the studies are successful and if the products are approved or of course also provides a good differentiation. In addition to all of that, I think the trust to the Pfizer brand name, which has been very, very strong I think also play a key differentiator. Now as regards the EU legislation what we haven't just seen in recent days, we are noticing the positive things of EU trying to be more competitive in attracting reserves and creating the regulatory framework for more rapid approvals. Clearly, we are also concerned at the same time with provisions that would like to reduce the exclusivity of data and other provisions. So, we hope that there will be an open dialogue with the EU so we can create a framework, but really will enhance innovation. Angela anything that you want to add to all of that?\nAngela Hwang: Maybe just to add to your question specifically about the adult portfolio, I really do believe that, this plays into our sweet spot. Through the last several years, both from or the Prevnar franchise for vaccinating adults throughout work in COVID, we have learned that, the clinical profile is one thing, but you really need reliable supply, you need a commercial infrastructure, you need a great ability to educate, raise awareness and drive people to vaccination. And I think on all of those counts, Pfizer is a winner. And so, we look forward to having a growing and a very robust respiratory portfolio that really leverages off of this incredible commercial machinery.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So, I want to ask you about margin improvement. You talked about that in your opening remarks. I'm curious, when we might start to see that and does that include the Seagen acquisition in your comments? And second question I had for you is. What are some of the key steps that you have taken already to transition Comirnaty and Paxlovid to the commercial markets? And when will you know how the season will shape up? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you very much, Louise. Dave, do you want to take the margin improvements and then Angela, a combination of products.\nDave Denton: Yes, thank you for your question. It is our expectation that, as we integrate Seagen in either late '23 or '24, early '24, we will begin to see margin improvement, and that will happen as we continue to improve our performance from a top-line perspective. At the same time, we are going to be very efficient and really work to minimize our SI&A investments going forward. So I think we should start to see that post the integration and the closing of the Seagen transactions.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, David. And, Angela, how are we preparing to transition commercial commitment?\nAngela Hwang: So, Louise, as you know, both of these products, both Comirnaty and Paxlovid, our products are very familiar to us. They fit very well in the the existing portfolio of products that we have. So the ability for us to move from an EUA into a full launch or into its business as usual for us, right? So, the typical things that we would always do which is awareness building with physicians and with patients that has begun and is well on the way. The things that you would do as a regard to our discussions with payers to demonstrate value and to create your value arguments for reimbursement and access that has begun. We have done a tremendous amount of work, as it pertains to retailers and making sure that, we have our distribution and our supply chain, well-oiled and the ability to be able to supply and to vaccinate to administer these products at both at a physical site, like a retailer or even in the case of Paxlovid getting telehealth and sort of remote health capabilities set up. So all of these capabilities, many of them, in fact, have been underway throughout the entire time of the pandemic. So I think we are in a very, very good position to seamlessly transition into commercialization.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Angela. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAkash Tewari: Can you talk about your next gen CDK4 program? You'll have first in-human data in ASCO. What is your team believe just hitting CDK4 allows you to improve on hyper-intense efficacy? And are there any plans to combine that drug with our venous cert given the DDI that's been shown up with IBRANCE? And then on your next gen Paxlovid program, can you confirm that it can achieve multiple-old over the EC91 adjusted for plasma protein binding? And is that for timelines on that product? Is the earliest possible commercial entry 2026 or is there a path for expedited approval?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Mikael, I think both questions can go to you.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: We are very excited about the next gen CDK4 inhibitor. It's looking really good in two aspects. You can dose and get the activity of the patient's Pal CDK4/6 because you deal with higher inhibition of this mechanism, and you have a better tolerability with no -- with much less neutropenia, less risk for infections. We expect media to report out and we have an aspirational target to start Phase 3, late this year posted earlier. At the same time as you asked, we are now running combination study CDK4 with CAT6, another inhibitor that has nice single agent activity and seem to combine well. We have a second combination with CDK2 and we think this would allow us next year to pick one or two combinations to advance up the lines with more potent treatment than what's available today. Similarly, we're looking at combination with 471, as you alluded to in order to benefit from Arvinas' collaboration. Next gen Paxlovid, yes, as alluded to in my introductory remarks, we have manifold above EC90. And as you know, for Paxlovid what's unique with that drug that the many fold exposure above EC90 as these four lead to no detectable meaningful emergence or mutations, which is always what you fear in antiviral single agent therapy. And this has been unique for Paxlovid versus other agents that have been used to for whether antibodies or antivirals. And this is exactly the profile for the next gen, but without the DDIs that allow us to improve and also to move into other supplementary segments. We're planning soon to start a Phase 2. And pending data possibly move quickly to Phase 3. And of course, we would like to see that agent introduced as soon as possible, I think we can hope to move swiftly pending event rates of COVID that will happen in the fall and further on that influence enrollment. So I think you said '26 and I would certainly hope we'd be ahead of that.\nOperator: Next we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two for me because I'm not sure you'll be able to answer one of them. I guess any would love your latest thoughts on your seasonal flu mRNA vaccine. Just in light of some of the Moderna data on the B antigen side just how should we think about your profile there? And then there's been some focus on this et cetera searches Opdivo, first-line Hodgkins lymphoma data that's going to be presented at ASCO. Just wondering if you can offer your high-level perspective on how you see that frontline landscape evolving? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Mikael, why don't you take the flu question and then the oncology question, we'll go to William.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: You know, we are very pleased what we see so far the totality, date of our few mRNA. As you know, we have reported out very high antibody titers to A, similar or possibly lower to the B antigens versus standard flu vaccines. But in contrast to standard flu vaccines, we have very nice T cell activity. And I think we are the only mRNA platform that has those CD4 and CD8 T cells of significance. We do think that could offer a unique profile for flu and the tolerability with our dose is very encouraging. So, the trial is in the last leg for readout. Hopefully, we'll be late to this for to share an update. And we are very encouraged and we are in parallel at least investing in combination opportunities with this and COVID and RSV in various combination as Albert early alluded to.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael, and William on the oncology front.\nDr. William Pao: Yes, sure. So again, this is a molecule for Seagen and such as, which is the CD30 ADC. It's already been approved in Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplant, and then previously untreated Hodgkin's lymphoma now with chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. And it's already we anticipate, actually later this year that label will be updated for overall survival. Now the data you're talking about is from the SWOG S1826 study with Nivo AVD versus Adcetris AVD, and I believe there'll be presenting PFS data. But this is a curable disease. And we believe that the OS update with the Adcetris label will show that Adcetris is the favorite product at this time.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Maybe first of all, [indiscernible] in the upcoming data. Could you just walk us through what are the key efficacy and safety thresholds you're looking to meet to move this forward. And sort of with regards to the threshold, how you think about them in light of it that this is big dosing and how does that potentially impact the sort of commercial opportunities? And then just second, a quick call on your DMD Phase 3 CIFFREO trial, you've guided to completion of recruitment in April of this year just could you give us a quick update here? And then how you view the opportunity and positioning in light of the fact that there's a potential competitor approval at the end of this month? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Mikael?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes, we are very excited about our two oral GLP, the 1532 and Danuglipron 1530 called Lotiglipron, and we're looking for a differentiated profile that will be a combination of rapid onset, high control of HbA1C bringing it down, and bodyweight loss at various doses to be very competitive, and a more easily tight treble drag that can optimize a preferred profile versus injectable when it comes to nausea and other well known effects. So, we look forward very much to data. Maybe later this year or possibly early next year and cherry pick the winner here. You also asked about the DMD, well if there is approval, it is based just on surrogate markers and in this area, I think it's very important to report out data, when it comes to real patient benefit. And we expect possibly already late this year, alternatively next year to have data from the first randomized study that if positive could show favorable benefit for patients doing better according to the North Star scale. So we feel really positive about our own DMD program and I think the entry will be competitive with the real data that patients need.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just have two. The first Angela on the I&I landscape, can you talk about your expectations for category growth just looking this year and next in light of the Humira and Stelara biosimilars to come? I'm asking just in the context for the elranatamab launch as well as Cibinqo? And then, Albert, I know this question has been asked, but the different way though. I know you expect this year for COVID to be a down year. But when you think about your scorecard outside the U.S. with payers, as you have transitioned to commercial, what's been the initial feedback from a sort of from a price and volume perspective, obviously, that's key to your assumptions in 2024 and beyond? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Let me answer the COVID question and then Angela will answer the I&I landscape. We expect to have commercialization in the U.S. I think likely the U.S. Government will stop purchasing outside the normal sandals products. We do not expect that to be the case in most of the countries international. We think that most of the countries will continue having governmental practices. And most of them, we have already long-term contracts. So, I don't think there will be much fluctuation over there in the price given the longevity of the product and the contracts expire prices option will be adjusted. Now let's move to the question about I&I and Angela, please.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Well, I think to answer that question you really have to look at each product and the specific disease that they are in. So, let's start with elranatamab, which is UC. There, we believe that we have an advantage from a clinical profile perspective. We believe that we have the best class S1B inhibitor, but there are also other great benefits such as the fact that, it can be used steroid free that we have convenient dosing. We also offer an oral option in a world that is very prevalent with injectables. And even with all of that, that's out there, we still have 50% of people that have not achieved remission. So I think that the unmet need in UC is clear. And for us, in particular, given the profile of elranatamab, what we think is the greatest opportunity for us is in earlier lines of treatment where there has not been as much transmit, right? There's a lot of anti-TNF, there is a lot of biosimilars, there's JAF, there's other mechanisms, but in earlier lines of treatment. There really is not enough. And so that's where we think we have an opportunity to meet an underserved need today and that's where we're going to be -- that's where we're going to be positioning, elranatamab. ritlecitinib is a different story when you look at that particular indication for alopecia that is really an under developed market. The 3 million people today, they're no great options for adults and there are absolutely no options for adolescents and children. And so the profile that we have with ritlecitinib, it's the best-in-class JAK, it's the best JAK. And I think that we're going to compete well. In addition to the fact that we're going to be the only JAK compared to ritlecitinib that has an indication for adolescents. So, I think in this regard because it's a new disease or a highly undeserved disease, I think education and awareness, education at the level of the prescriber, the patient, but also with the payers is going to be key to our ability to access this market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nTrung Huynh: I have two, if I can. So first one a few days ago, you saw the FDA advisory committee vote on Lynparza's PROpel trial. In that the committee voted against the approval in all-comers. So TALZENNA and TALAPRO2, what's your expectations for your label here given the strength of your data? And could that affect your $1 billion peak sales number that you gave in December? And then for the RSV flu co-administration study, what flu vaccine did you test that with? Is that the high dose or the low dose? And if it's the low dose, could you be approved for use with the high dose, which is more relevant today?\nDr. Albert Bourla: William, would you like to take TALAPRO part question?\nWilliam Pao: As Mikael said, the study showed with enzalutamide plus TALAPRO versus Tala versus enza, we showed a 37% reduction in the radiograph of progression free survival. Notably, in the same presentation, we also showed the hazard ratio in the HR deficient population of 0.48, a significant P value and then the HRR non-deficient unknown population HR of 0.7 with a P value of 0.04. So, we remain confident about our data and the outcome or population obviously, we can't compare to PROpel. Notably in TALAPRO2, we have prospective testing for HRR deficiencies including BRCA1 and 2. I also want to point out that our control arm of XTANDI reaffirmed XTANDI is best-in-class NHT for the indication with a radiographic PFS of 22 months. And in the treatment on tala, our rPFS was not reached. So, we expect that the HR population, which is 25% will be compelling with the data and we'll also continue to present additional data in HR subpopulation at ASCO in 2023. And notably, we did get prior to review and we're currently in registration.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, William. And Mikael, about RSV and flu.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. We are extremely excited about the RSV vaccine and we'll provide data on co-administration of that vaccine with the advent of flu. We expect you to be available and generalize to all flu vaccines. And then when it comes to longer term, we also are already in combination study with our RSV and using our internal portfolio of COVID and mRNA flu, so we see this as an event developing a very strong portfolio this year with co-administration opportunities next year, possibly our own flu vaccine and then combination thereof. So stay tuned.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you Mikael. Next question please.\nOperator: Next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: Just coming back to the, your oral GLP-1 portfolio. Lily has called out an anticipated weight loss that first two weeks from memory of around 14%, 15%. They hesitate to give baseline. Given the competitive nature of the field, you're late to market and the cost of running CVOT trials in this setting. Where does the relative weight loss need to be from your Phase 2 for you to advance given the benchmark that Lily seems to be setting?\nDr. Albert Bourla: That's a good question for Mikael.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. No, we agree completely with you that we should have an ambitious profile. And we have certainly seen patients up to 15% weight loss, depending on different dose regimens. So for obesity, that's a really good ambition to have up to 15%. And for diabetes patients, of course, it's about having a very strong HbA1c lowering maybe 2% or even more. So, we think it's feasible with all roles. And we think that will open up a very large place. And we think that pending data readout that we may have a differentiated profile for our full agonists.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. So we are waiting to see the data that will speak. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Just a two questions for me. Maybe first on the capital allocation comments, I guess the more balanced capital allocation post-Seagen de-levering. Just for up front, where do we need to see leverage go to before we can think about that balanced allocation? And in the meantime, what is the capacity and appetite for further deal? So can we think about kind of Biohaven size deals while you're delivering from Seagen or is it really smaller transactions? And then my second question was just one on RSV market development. So quickly, do you see this market developing? I guess I'm just trying to get my hands around how much education this require? And do you worry at all about vaccine fatigue? I guess, just given all the boosters that this population has received during the pandemic, is that slow at all the uptake versus kind of a normalized environment? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Good questions, Chris. Dave, capital allocation.\nDave Denton: Yes. So thank you, Chris, for the question. Obviously, we have invested heavily back into our business. Here's all with the focus of growing our business from both from a top line perspective and importantly from a bottom line perspective. And I think now as we begin to cycle into, I'll say, post the peak of these reinvestment in the business. We should begin to harvest if you will, some of the cash flows coming out of the investments that we made and capitalize, if you will, on the returns that we expect out of these investments. So having said that, we expect because of that we should get ourselves back more balanced into the three pillars, again, reinvesting back in our business, growing our dividend and doing a value enhancing share repurchases. From a leverage perspective, obviously, we want to maintain our high investment grade rating in access to Tier 1 commercial paper. That would say that, we would probably be in the low 3x levered ZIP code from that perspective. And then from M&A perspective, we are still active in the M&A market. Obviously, first and foremost, on our objective now is close and begin to integrate Seagen. So that's priority number one. Having said that, we will still look at the M&A marketplace, understand if there is assets that meet our criteria to supplement our business, and we could theoretically execute against that, given our capital rupture. Having said that, in the near-term, those will probably be smaller, little tuck-in type deals given our leverage ratio in the very near-term.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you there. Angela, what about RSV and the educational efforts that the market would need?\nAngela Hwang: Well, with all launches, education is really important and that's why we have already begun our unbranded disease education with physicians laying the groundwork for the importance of vaccinating with or vaccinating for RSV. But of course, with all launches and with all new diseases, an education is important to consumers, it's important to caregivers, to payers and so on all of those fronts. Those discussions have either begun or are beginning, and we plan to obviously implement a robust market development plan like we do for all of our vaccines. However, I think that the biggest advantage here is in the synergies of RSV together with our other adult vaccines, right. We have now 20 adults. We have had COVID. All of these vaccines follow a very similar pattern in terms of the commercial needs that they have. And I think that we have the opportunity to quickly and seamless bring RSV on into our portfolio and use the very same approaches and mechanisms and the same conversations that were -- whether it's with a retailer, whether it's air, whether it's with our points of vaccinations to bring RSV on. So actually, I think that this is a very exciting time, and we feel very confident about the ability to seamlessly introduce RSV as another vaccine in our respiratory portfolio.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. First, could you discuss the Paxlovid private market sales potential in China, after March 31st that isn't included in your Paxlovid guidance for the year? And also could you comment on the late stage competitive threats from Sanofi's 21-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine in adults and infants and Merck's 21-Valent in adults? Thank you.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Angela, Paxlovid equity in private market in China.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. So, after April, we continue to have Paxlovid available and but it will be assessed through an out of pocket payment mechanism. So if you are a private patient, you can get it. If you're a public patient, you can get it, you just need to be able to pay up pocket for it. And we intend to continue to work with the public and with the Chinese Government to ensure its access.\nDr. Albert Bourla: We can't give now guidance for a particular product in a particular country. So -- but, as I'm explaining the dynamics, Mikael, very quickly on the competition of pneumococcal.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes. I mean, we are extremely excited about the PCV20 recent pediatric approval with a Stellar label reflecting the strengths of our data. We monitor carefully competitor activity, as you alluded to, and are planning ourselves to enter next year further expanded PCV vaccines, followed by additional expansion a few years later, including optimization of the conjugation procedures, including different carriers, and possibly for the adult also had adjuvant that we think could be useful. So this is a market where we have been the leaders were having a unique platform, and we monitor and feel very confident that we are going to have a bright future, although you mentioned competitor, which is a nature of markets that are becoming of course more saturated like the adult market, but there will also hope to benefit from our broader portfolio of respiratory vaccines from COVID flu RSV, that cannot be much harder at the moment.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala: I have to follow-ups. First on pneumococcal vaccine. So Pfizer just started a study of a vaccine, including a new ingredient. Is the new ingredients and adjuvant is it more valence or is it something else? And then follow up on the Opdivo versus Adcetris study? Can you say whether you were aware of the data at the time of announcing the Seagen acquisition? And why should we not view this as a significant risk?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Mikael, what is the secret ingredient?\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: The secret sauce in this particular trial is a new adjuvant that we think could play and potential nice role in the PCV adult market as you go to increasing balance in this face. As I said before, in parallel, we are working on looking at different carriers, different chemistries, and we will shortly reveal for next year a start of a broader expanded PCV vaccine that will cooperate all these learnings. So stay tuned.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And William again on the Opdivo study.\nWilliam Pao: Sure. So again, on the Opdivo study, that SWOG study has been ongoing for a while we were not aware of the data that's going to be presented at ASCO. I would reiterate again, it's early PFS data from what we see and the most important measure of activity in Hodgkin's lymphoma would be overall survival. And again, we expect Seagen to get an updated label showing overall survival benefit in first line Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nKerry Holford: Two questions on the RSV vaccine. The only older adult vaccine on Slide 22, you know emerging mid second season data supporting durable vaccine efficacy. I wonder if you can elaborate a little more here. What data do you have in hunt today and you want to act against that second phase of data in front of the FDA approval? Assuming do you see protection into that second season? How might that influence your pricing in the U.S.? And secondly, on the maternal vaccine, you have thought scheduled in Q4 on Slide 6, implies that that may not happen till the first quarter of next year. So could you just provide more clarity on when you could launch that maternal vaccine?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Yes, Mikael was about the RSV vaccine.\nDr. Mikael Dolsten: Yes, we were very pleased to get our first data chunk from second season mid-season data for older adults. And it clearly shows that robust data that we shared, for example, we shared high 80% reduction in lower respiratory tract infections with three symptoms. We see also on this and similar on other endpoint, a very robust, very meaningful protection also in the second season. Now, as you know, at the same time, we are preparing for the future combination vaccines. And we think in general that you will see an evolution in the adult market with simplified vaccination schedule, and your revaccination of COVID flu RSV. For those that for some reason, these are vaccination, we think the second season data will be very good. On the maternal, we are preparing for an advisory committee, we think we have great data, we are the only one that have been able to conclude the maternal vaccination, we're the only one that we're able to construct an RSV vaccine without using an adjuvant. And we think it's a differentiated product, and I assume will be sooner after a potential approval and opportunity for Angela to launch to very eagerly awaiting community of increasingly attentive pregnant women and maternal clinics to protect the newborn.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, Mike. As we said, in our slide, we expect to be approved in this year in the last quarter. So good launch, we expect the publication of the MMWR likely to happen beginning of the next year. So that plays also a key role in the uptake with the vaccine. But keep in mind the launch of vaccines starts before the approval, right? We have done a lot of educational efforts and there are a lot of investments that we are doing in that field. So in that aspect, the launch already has started from our side at least.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: I guess, first on the decision to establish a new operating segment and specifically launched this Pfizer IGNITE offering. Can you talk about what drove that? And if there's sort of like an aspirational target, and how meaningful have a driver that could be? And then secondly, sort of on the decision to divest Bavencio, did that reflect the sort of a signal you got from FTC or a proactive move in your mind or are there other factors we should think about? And the fact that we haven't seen other divestments to that sort of reinforce our confidence that you think that the deal can go through without other issues? Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you very much. On the Bavencio question, the discussions to return the rights for royalties, in exchange for royalties, it started well before Seagen, so it has nothing to do with the acquisition of Seagen. It was something that was ongoing between us and Serrano for the benefit of the product and for simplicity reasons. It just was completed after we announced the deal shortly after, but it had started way, way before. Amir, would you like also to explain the IGNITE business?\nAamir Malik: Yes, Carter, thanks for the question. I think you have seen us collaborate with the biotech ecosystem lots of different ways, and Pfizer IGNITE is another way in which we can effectively do that. Frankly, there is a lot of interest and demand on the part of particularly Biotec for working with us to access some of our distinctive research and clinical development capabilities. And we think IGNITE gives us a platform to do that, to work with these companies, get closer to the science, which over time also then improves our ability to access that science and make determinations about what we would like to bring in-house. So, we think this is a excellent way for us to continue to collaborate with the Biotec ecosystem and add to our growing and compelling pipeline overtime.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. On Paxlovid, the U.S. commercial opportunity, can you update us on any framing of what you are thinking in terms of pricing, and when we will know that? And in particular with the commercial availability, are you anticipating much in the way of sort of payer engagements in terms of thinking about how that process will unfold utilization management wise? And then on the business development front, if we go to the $30 billion that you had outlined for a while now, and think about what is remaining from that unadjusted target in terms of 2030 revenues. Let's say, approximately $5 billion is left. As we are thinking about, how you guys are contemplating what areas to go into in terms of verticals or therapeutic areas or modalities? Would it be fair to expect that at this stage a consideration might be to minimize the then that you would have to rebuild or sort of refurbish on the SI&A front given your margin objectives longer-term?\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you. Angela, on Paxlovid commercialization.\nAngela Hwang: Sure. Hi, Chris. Yes. We are preparing for launch now. But as we have said, we have shared before the date of launch and exactly how that's going to happen is still very much subject to our discussions with the U.S. Government. So, we are going to align with guidance from them in terms of how that's going to happen. Of course, in the meantime, we are preparing for the commercialization of Paxlovid and payer discussions around the world is critical. So, those have begun. Obviously, it's too early for me to share the price of Paxlovid. But suffice to say that, the price ranges that we have brought to our payers together with the value arguments that we have been able to develop through robust real world evidence from the number hospitalizations, the number of deaths that we have been able to avert through the treatment with Paxlovid is very much supportive of the pricing ranges that we are talking about. So, I think very soon we will be able to share more.\nDr. Albert Bourla: And Amir about what is the profile of [indiscernible] BDA activities.\nAamir Malik: Yes. Chris, as you mentioned, we have a goal of $25 billion in risk adjusted you by 2030, and I should remind everyone that is a 2030 goal. We with the deals that we have done have remaining balance of less than $5 billion against that goal. And I think our strategy to pursue that is going to be consistent with what we have employed to-date. First and foremost, it's going to be about compelling science that we can add value to. That's also going to contribute growth in the 25 to 30 period and take lots of things into consideration, including the impact on the P&L profile. So, that will continue to be our focus and will continue to be disciplined and the opportunities that we look for. And as Dave mentioned earlier, our priority right now is ensuring that we close out and successfully integrate the Seagen transaction, as well as drive value from the other deals that we've done and will continue to actively look for opportunities.\nDr. Albert Bourla: Thank you, and we are a bit out of time, so last question, please.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: A couple of questions. The first is, how much of your future COVID vaccine revenue forecast are tied to the ability to have a combination product, if something like mRNA flu ends up not being viable, and a knockout of flu COVID combo, would that impact your anticipated uptake in 2025 and beyond? Or can you get to those longer term guidance levels regardless of whether you have any combos or not? And then last question, Albert, I'm guessing, there's some frustration among management with what the stock's been doing, a tough 2023, 2022 wasn't a great year. This is despite Pfizer helping lead the world out of the pandemic, which was a remarkable accomplishment. Even today, the consensus stock is down a little bit. So as you talk to analysts and investors, what are you hearing are the biggest concerns that you think could explain this? And what do you think analysts and investors are missing or misunderstanding?\nAlbert Bourla: Let me start with the first one. We do expect that if there are successful combinations with flu that will drive the fluctuation of the corporate vaccine much higher, as you know, in our estimations will be expect, for example, in the U.S. around 24%, 25%, in the next few years of COVID vaccine. The flu right now utilization around 50. So, there is a big gap. So, that's why we believe that the combination between flu and COVID will arise also to the COVID. And eventually, we can call the way up to the same utilization like flu, particularly given that there are no copays in approved and recommended vaccines. Now as regards to the frustration, for the 2023, clearly, I believe that the stock price right now does not reflect the value that half Pfizer has. The fact that we are so proud because of our contribution in saving the world, I don't think, but we expect the stock price increases because of that. We did it because it was the right thing to do. And I think we are very, very proud of that. But we expect to see stock price increases as we are executing our plan, which is to create sustainable top line revenue growth that will allow us to leverage the bottom line that will grow faster than the top line. And I think we articulated the plan about that and that plan was to invest in acquiring good scientific substrate that will allow us to launch products that will give us $25 billion revenues by year 2030, and we have done tremendous progress on that by having already according to our calculation of $20 billion. We are also invested in R&D in the last in the past few years, and we have now an unprecedented launch of new products. And I think the street is expected to see how those launches will evolve. Clearly, I think there is overhang over the COVID revenues. There is uncertainty, if there COVID revenues will materialize, we don't have any precedents to show that we know how to predict it well. So our predictions are based on epidemiological science, and based on trends that we are testing with market people. So I think that from my perspective, what I said was that we are very committed to creating value for the shareholders. We know that everything we do, we do it with their money it's not our money. And we want to be very good stewards of that. So, it's not enough to save the world. I think also, we need to increase their surprise and are highly committed to do that by explaining better the strategy more importantly, executing on it. So with that, I think, gave me also team a good segue to close. In summary, we believe that was a solid quarter we deliver on our commitments, we exceeded actual expectations, we know from history. And we will continue doing so with a compass that we will create serious value for patience and that we are certain will translate into value for shareholders. We are executing our plan and we will remain very committed to doing that. Thank you very much to all and have a nice day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's teleconference and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wander day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dr. William Pao",
            "content": "Yes, sure. I would say we are just very excited about the recent approval in the first line Seagen in eligible population, which Seagen has got, which is about 8,000 to 9,000 patients in the U.S., and we are excited to see additional data coming in first line Seagen eligible EV--302 study, which as you know is Peds plus Prevnar versus platinum gemcitabine. We can't comment any further as a Seagen. And if that positive, that would increase the eligible population by another 10,000 to 12,000. Yes, sure. So again, this is a molecule for Seagen and such as, which is the CD30 ADC. It's already been approved in Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplant, and then previously untreated Hodgkin's lymphoma now with chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. And it's already we anticipate, actually later this year that label will be updated for overall survival. Now the data you're talking about is from the SWOG S1826 study with Nivo AVD versus Adcetris AVD, and I believe there'll be presenting PFS data. But this is a curable disease. And we believe that the OS update with the Adcetris label will show that Adcetris is the favorite product at this time."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dr. Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was a solid, foundational quarter in what we expect to be an exciting year for Pfizer and patients. Our financial results were as we anticipated. Our non-COVID revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter, while overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily due to a previously communicated and expected decline in Comirnaty revenues. Even with Comirnaty's decline, our COVID franchises remained significant contributors to the business with a combined $7.1 billion in revenues during the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by recently acquired products, Nurtec for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease, our anti-infective Sulperazon, Eliquis, in the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the U.S., and our Vyndaqel family of products for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy ATTR-CM. We also continue to be proud of our patient impact. During the first quarter, more than 250 million patients were treated with our medicines and vaccines. With this solid start to the year, we remain on track to grow our non-COVID revenues by 7% to 9% operationally in 2023. That's because the majority of our potential near-term product launches, as you can see mapped out on this slide, are expected to occur in the second half of the year, following regulatory approvals where not yet secured. As such, we expect our non-COVID revenues to grow at a faster rate in the second half of the year than in the first. Overall, we are in the midst of an 18-month period in which we expect to launch up to 19 potential new products and indications. Over the first four months of the year, we have made excellent progress toward this goal with the approval of Zavzpret, an expanded indication for Cibinqo to include adolescents, and last week's approval of Prevnar 20 for pediatric use, all in the U.S. We also have secured regulatory filing acceptances for elranatamab, for Braftovi and Mektovi for non-small cell lung cancer, and for our RSV maternal vaccine candidate, which if approved would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth through six months. In addition, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has granted priority review and the European Medicines Agency has accepted our MAA filing for review of Talzenna for use in combination with Xtandi for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, based on the TALAPRO2 results. Regarding our COVID-19 franchises, we continue to expect 2023 to be a transition year as the virus continues to mutate and we move from advance purchases under government contracts to more traditional supply arrangements in a commercial model for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. As previously discussed, in 2023 and 2024 we expect vaccine utilization to decline compared with 2022. Then starting in 2025 and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of various COVID combination vaccines. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar -- with some variations from country-to-country. Regarding Paxlovid, we continue to expect the government inventory that was built around the world last year to be absorbed by the end of this year. We then expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the courses sold and courses used will more closely align. With its robust efficacy, consistent safety profile, and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID-19 on patients and their families, health systems and society, Paxlovid is proving to be an important and durable complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40% of the global adult population at high risk for progressing to severe disease. Now let's take a look at Pfizer's next potential moonshot: the battle against cancer. Oncology remains a core therapeutic area for Pfizer, and we believe the proposed acquisition of Seagen will enhance our position in this important space. Integration planning is already underway, and we continue to expect the deal to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. By combining Seagen's category-leading antibody-drug conjugate technology with Pfizer's scale, expertise and capabilities, we believe we can accelerate potential breakthroughs in cancer medicines and introduce new solutions to patients around the world. The potential combined commercial infrastructure for Pfizer and Seagen will be 3x the size of that of Seagen alone in the U.S. and 4x, 5x larger globally. As a result, we believe acquiring Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 risk-adjusted revenues, with potential significant growth beyond 2030. Even with the Seagen deal, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, we continue to have the flexibility to take additional actions to create shareholder value. Dave will provide more details on this during his presentation. One of the key areas of focus for Pfizer in 2023 is continuing to build trust, which is a key asset for every biopharmaceuticals company. Since the beginning of the year, we have received two accolades that demonstrate we are doing just that. In February, Pfizer was named to the Top 10 of Fortune's Most Admired Companies List for the second year in a row. And in March, Ethisphere recognized Pfizer as one of the world's most ethical companies, also for the second year in a row. At Pfizer, trust is everything. It gives us our license to operate, allows us to attract the best talent and enables us to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives. With that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave? Umer, can you repeat the question, I'm not sure we understood it. Yes, thank you very much. Angela, why don't we take the second question about the guidance --p about the 1 billion estimated sales in the last quarter. Thank you, Angela. On the question about the season asset although should be very careful, because we can't comment on that. But maybe you can make William, quick comment, general speaking. No doubt, the population that excites us, but of course, we can comment on the Seagen products. Next question please. Again, Angela back to you. Maybe I can answer those questions. So, the EU negotiations, they are still ongoing. So, we can't comment on that. Yes, we can include part of -- included our estimation of how these negotiations will end up in our guidance. And still we are not close, so I can make any comment on that. It wouldn't be appropriate as the discussions are still ongoing. As regards the demand for Paxlovid or for vaccines, as we had said, we expect that the demand for vaccines will go down. We gave the estimations that will go down to approximately 24% of people in the U.S. and relevant numbers a different country by country as underlying demand that for boosters and things I think are progressing towards that goal, we will have to see as most of these will happen in the last in after summer, when it is the traditional period that flow is also vaccinations are happening. Demand for Paxlovid right now is following very, very accurately, the infection rates. So, when we monitor it on a weekly basis, and really it is going when we have almost equal percentage of infections is equal percentage of the case Paxlovid. So, we expect that we'll continue going like that because we have less compliance with the vaccination recommendations across the world as people are tired with COVID and we expect that fewer people, as I said this year will get the vaccine compared to last year. And so, this means that the immune protection of the population will go down. As a result, we expect that we will have more infections and that will drive more use of Paxlovid. But of course, that's what our logical models are telling us, we'll have to see what eventually will happen in real life. Thank you for your question. We may go to the next question, please. I didn't hear which product you spoke about? Thank you. And maybe I can give you a very general answer. And then if Angela wants to chime in, please. On the COVID, we are right now, all right, we have the big markets there. And then we plan to maintain that. So, I think we are then. When it comes to RSV, we are the only ones but we have both or we have positive data on both, on adults and on maternal. And we have already approved for the adults and then we are expecting approval for the maternal. So, that the strength of our data with efficacy and safety profile that we think is differentiated, will provide us with what we hope also to be the winners in that one. As flu on mRNA technology still the results, we are very optimistic with the totality of the data that we are having from our flu vaccine, and we will wait to see of course how that will continue. And then of course, the winners, there will be also those that they will be able to build from the maze of all of that. So, the fact that we have all three of them or we have a good chance to have all three of them, if the studies are successful and if the products are approved or of course also provides a good differentiation. In addition to all of that, I think the trust to the Pfizer brand name, which has been very, very strong I think also play a key differentiator. Now as regards the EU legislation what we haven't just seen in recent days, we are noticing the positive things of EU trying to be more competitive in attracting reserves and creating the regulatory framework for more rapid approvals. Clearly, we are also concerned at the same time with provisions that would like to reduce the exclusivity of data and other provisions. So, we hope that there will be an open dialogue with the EU so we can create a framework, but really will enhance innovation. Angela anything that you want to add to all of that? Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you very much, Louise. Dave, do you want to take the margin improvements and then Angela, a combination of products. Thank you, David. And, Angela, how are we preparing to transition commercial commitment? Thank you, Angela. Next question, please. Mikael, I think both questions can go to you. Thank you. Mikael, why don't you take the flu question and then the oncology question, we'll go to William. Thank you, Mikael, and William on the oncology front. Thank you. Next question please. Mikael? Thank you, Mikael. Next question please. Let me answer the COVID question and then Angela will answer the I&I landscape. We expect to have commercialization in the U.S. I think likely the U.S. Government will stop purchasing outside the normal sandals products. We do not expect that to be the case in most of the countries international. We think that most of the countries will continue having governmental practices. And most of them, we have already long-term contracts. So, I don't think there will be much fluctuation over there in the price given the longevity of the product and the contracts expire prices option will be adjusted. Now let's move to the question about I&I and Angela, please. William, would you like to take TALAPRO part question? Thank you, William. And Mikael, about RSV and flu. Thank you Mikael. Next question please. That's a good question for Mikael. Thank you, Mikael. So we are waiting to see the data that will speak. Let's go to the next question, please. Good questions, Chris. Dave, capital allocation. Thank you there. Angela, what about RSV and the educational efforts that the market would need? Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you. Angela, Paxlovid equity in private market in China. We can't give now guidance for a particular product in a particular country. So -- but, as I'm explaining the dynamics, Mikael, very quickly on the competition of pneumococcal. Thank you, Mikael. Next question please. Thank you. Mikael, what is the secret ingredient? And William again on the Opdivo study. Yes, Mikael was about the RSV vaccine. Thank you, Mike. As we said, in our slide, we expect to be approved in this year in the last quarter. So good launch, we expect the publication of the MMWR likely to happen beginning of the next year. So that plays also a key role in the uptake with the vaccine. But keep in mind the launch of vaccines starts before the approval, right? We have done a lot of educational efforts and there are a lot of investments that we are doing in that field. So in that aspect, the launch already has started from our side at least. Thank you. Next question please. Thank you. Angela, on Paxlovid commercialization. And Amir about what is the profile of [indiscernible] BDA activities. Thank you, and we are a bit out of time, so last question, please."

            "name": "Dave Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin with Pfizer's capital allocation strategy before we dive into additional commentary about our quarterly performance and outlook for the remainder of 2023. As you know our strategy includes three pillars: reinvesting in the business; growing and paying dividends; and repurchasing our shares. In the first three months of 2023, we have invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and importantly, allocated approximately $43 billion for the proposed Seagen acquisition. Over the last few years, we have reinvested heavily into our business to drive long-term growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. We have invested in Pfizer's own science, while acquiring the best external science to supplement our pipeline. Since 2022, we've invested approximately $70 billion, including Seagen, in business development. In addition, we have continued to grow our dividend. For the past 14 years, we have raised our dividend annually. Since 2010, our quarterly cash dividend grew from $0.16 a share to $0.41 a share in 2023. Looking ahead, as we exit this unprecedented period of anticipated launches, we would expect to achieve margin improvement over time. As we begin to de-lever our capital structure after the closing of the Seagen transaction, we expect to return to a more balanced capital allocation mix between our three pillars. While we will continue to invest in our business, we do expect more balance between that priority and returning value to our shareholders via increased dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy is squarely focused on driving shareholder value while at the same time remaining committed to a high investment grade Tier 1 commercial paper rating. Now turning to the quarter, as Albert said, our results were in line with our expectations, albeit slightly better than consensus. As expected, overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in Comirnaty, which was partially offset by strong Paxlovid sales. I want to point out that our COVID-19 products produced $7.1 billion in revenues in the first quarter alone. Our non-COVID operational revenue growth was solid at 5% year-over-year. Primarily driving this growth was the inclusion of Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta, and an increase in Sulperazon revenues in China. Revenues for Eliquis in the U.S. and the Vyndaqel family globally also contributed to this growth. Now, I want to remind you of the seasonality of some of our products. In the first-quarter, Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta typically have lower sales quarter-on-quarter due to annual copay reset dynamics, with higher sales anticipated in later quarters. Most important, both products continue to experience strong growth in demand. Sulperazon revenues increased more than $100 million year-over-year, due to higher demand in China during the quarter, which we do not expect to be sustained going forward. The demand was due to increased bacterial infections from more patients being hospitalized for COVID. To help ensure the success of the expected launches of our large number of new and acquired products and indications, we increased our investments in SI&A. These investments are squarely focused on Pfizer's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations. Moving to the bottom-line, reported diluted EPS this quarter declined by 29% to $0.97, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.23 declined 20% on an operational basis during the quarter. Once again this quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing first quarter revenues by $730 million, or 3%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.07, or 4%, compared to LY. Now turning to the full year financial outlook for the Company, our full year 2023 guidance remains unchanged. On a total company basis, we continue to expect revenues of $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. With 5% operational growth in our non-COVID revenues this quarter, we are on-track to achieve our non-COVID revenue guidance of 7% to 9% operational growth for the full year. Given that a large number of launches are expected to occur in the third and fourth quarter of 2023, we anticipate our quarterly revenues will not be linear this year and that our non-COVID revenues will grow more quickly in the back half of the year versus the first half of 2023. In terms of our COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we expect sales to trend more seasonally in this year. Given these dynamics, we expect significantly lower sales contributions from our COVID products in the second quarter versus the first quarter. In fact, given the anticipated timing of approvals for a fall vaccine with strain change, we would expect more substantial vaccine deliveries to start in September, which is late in the U.S. third quarter and the beginning of our international fourth quarter. With respect to Paxlovid, we continue to expect 2023 to be a transitional year as we anticipate shifting to a commercial market in the second half of this year. We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. On a full year basis, we expect that foreign exchange will have an unfavorable impact compared with full year 2022 of approximately $0.13, on adjusted diluted earnings per share. We are also reaffirming the remaining components of our full year 2023 guidance, which you can find in the Appendix of the Q1 2023 earnings presentation. So in closing, this is an exciting period for Pfizer as we continue to invest to drive long-term growth and importantly enhance long-term shareholder value. With that, now let me turn it over to Mikael. Yes, thank you for your question. It is our expectation that, as we integrate Seagen in either late '23 or '24, early '24, we will begin to see margin improvement, and that will happen as we continue to improve our performance from a top-line perspective. At the same time, we are going to be very efficient and really work to minimize our SI&A investments going forward. So I think we should start to see that post the integration and the closing of the Seagen transactions. Yes. So thank you, Chris, for the question. Obviously, we have invested heavily back into our business. Here's all with the focus of growing our business from both from a top line perspective and importantly from a bottom line perspective. And I think now as we begin to cycle into, I'll say, post the peak of these reinvestment in the business. We should begin to harvest if you will, some of the cash flows coming out of the investments that we made and capitalize, if you will, on the returns that we expect out of these investments. So having said that, we expect because of that we should get ourselves back more balanced into the three pillars, again, reinvesting back in our business, growing our dividend and doing a value enhancing share repurchases. From a leverage perspective, obviously, we want to maintain our high investment grade rating in access to Tier 1 commercial paper. That would say that, we would probably be in the low 3x levered ZIP code from that perspective. And then from M&A perspective, we are still active in the M&A market. Obviously, first and foremost, on our objective now is close and begin to integrate Seagen. So that's priority number one. Having said that, we will still look at the M&A marketplace, understand if there is assets that meet our criteria to supplement our business, and we could theoretically execute against that, given our capital rupture. Having said that, in the near-term, those will probably be smaller, little tuck-in type deals given our leverage ratio in the very near-term."

            "name": "Aamir Malik",
            "content": "Yes, Carter, thanks for the question. I think you have seen us collaborate with the biotech ecosystem lots of different ways, and Pfizer IGNITE is another way in which we can effectively do that. Frankly, there is a lot of interest and demand on the part of particularly Biotec for working with us to access some of our distinctive research and clinical development capabilities. And we think IGNITE gives us a platform to do that, to work with these companies, get closer to the science, which over time also then improves our ability to access that science and make determinations about what we would like to bring in-house. So, we think this is a excellent way for us to continue to collaborate with the Biotec ecosystem and add to our growing and compelling pipeline overtime. Yes. Chris, as you mentioned, we have a goal of $25 billion in risk adjusted you by 2030, and I should remind everyone that is a 2030 goal. We with the deals that we have done have remaining balance of less than $5 billion against that goal. And I think our strategy to pursue that is going to be consistent with what we have employed to-date. First and foremost, it's going to be about compelling science that we can add value to. That's also going to contribute growth in the 25 to 30 period and take lots of things into consideration, including the impact on the P&L profile. So, that will continue to be our focus and will continue to be disciplined and the opportunities that we look for. And as Dave mentioned earlier, our priority right now is ensuring that we close out and successfully integrate the Seagen transaction, as well as drive value from the other deals that we've done and will continue to actively look for opportunities."
        },
        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Dr. Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Today I'd like to start off with one of the four pillars of our oncology portfolio, which are breast, urogenital, blood cancers and precision medicine. Within urogenital, prostate cancer is an area in which we have strong momentum. Recent positive study results further strengthen our franchise, building upon the global standard of care set by XTANDI, and underscoring our long-standing commitment to the pursuit of breakthroughs that define new standards of care in prostate cancer. I'll highlight data from two Phase 3 studies, EMBARK and TALAPRO-2, as well as early, but promising signals from our EZH2 inhibitor, each of which has the potential to reach broader patient populations across the treatment continuum in prostate cancer. Final analysis from TALAPRO-2, evaluating our potential blockbuster PARP inhibitor TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI were presented at ASCO GU. Results showed significant and clinically meaningful improvement across the all-comers population in radiographic progression free survival, or rPFS, in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutations. There was a 37% reduction in risk of disease progression. Median rPFS in patients treated with TALZENNA and XTANDI was not reached at the time of analysis versus 21.9 months for placebo plus XTANDI. A trend in overall survival favoring TALZENNA plus XTANDI was also observed, though these data are immature. The final OS data will be reported once the predefined number of survival events has been reached. Treatment with TALZENNA and XTANDI resulted in statistically significant improvement in overall response rates, which suggest a potential cooperative effect between the two treatments. The U.S. FDA has granted Priority Review for our sNDA for TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, with a decision expected in 2023. The ongoing TALAPRO-3 study, if successful, may further expand the reach of this potential blockbuster into the HRR-deficient metastatic castration sensitive population. We recently presented data from our Phase 3 EMBARK study evaluating XTANDI plus leuprolide in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence at the American Urological Association's 2023 Annual Meeting. The study met its primary endpoint with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in metastasis-free survival, with a 58% reduction in risk for radiographic progression or death. Key secondary endpoints were met including time to PSA progression. These results suggest XTANDI, the only novel hormone therapy approved for three disease states of prostate cancer in the U.S., has the potential if approved to expand to patients in the hormone-sensitive, or castration sensitive setting, for the first time. Next, I'd like to share early data from one of our next-wave candidates, a potential first-in-class and best-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, which we shorthand as 1497. EZH2 is an epigenetic transcriptional repressor that is frequently over expressed in prostate cancer. We believe that inhibition of EZH2 may provide synergistic effects in combination with XTANDI, with the potential to address unmet needs of patients with androgen-sensitive and resistant disease. Here are data from our ongoing Phase 1/2 study evaluating \u20181497 in second line mCRPC patients with prior abiraterone and/or XTANDI, and up to one line of chemotherapy. On the left are updated data from a Phase 1 dose escalation study shared at ESMO last year. These encouraging results show durable anti-tumor activity in both XTANDI-nai\u0308ve and experienced patients, with all XTANDI-nai\u0308ve patients having received prior abiraterone. Importantly, this suggests that the addition of our EZH2 inhibitor has the potential to sensitize XTANDI resistant tumors, which is an increasing clinical unmet need. The early rPFS data are also highly encouraging, reaching 8.7 months in the XTANDI experienced patients. and 17.1 months in XTANDI-nai\u0308ve both of which are notably longer than historical controls. For example, in the control arm of the CARD study, rPFS for XTANDI alone was 4.8 months in XTANDI-nai\u0308ve patients. And although cross-trial comparisons cannot be made, these results, in combination with the emerging objective response rate and PSA50 response, are supportive of the contribution of our EZH2 inhibitor candidate in driving these responses. From a safety perspective, the combination was generally well tolerated, with mostly Grade 1 and 2 events. The randomized Phase 2 study in second line mCRPC is ongoing, with data expected in early 2024. Now, we turn to the potential for near-term growth across our respiratory vaccine franchise. Prevnar 20, our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is now approved for children aged 6 weeks through 17 years. We are confident in our ability to maintain leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space with Prevnar 20, which offers the broadest serotype coverage of any pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, helping to protect against the 20 serotypes in the vaccine. We have strong momentum with our RSV vaccine candidate, having received a positive VRBPAC Committee vote supporting potential approval to help combat RSV in older adults and PDUFA dates for our Older Adult and Maternal indications in quick succession in the coming months. Just last month, the New England Journal of Medicine published results from the two positive Phase 3 studies. Emerging data from the middle of the second RSV season in the Northern Hemisphere in the Phase 3 Older Adult study support meaningful durable vaccine efficacy; we will share the data once complete. In the coming months, we plan to start a Phase 3 study of the RSV vaccine candidate in 18- to 60-year-olds at high risk for RSV and in immunocompromised adults 18 and over, and a Phase 1 study in 2 to 18-year-olds at high risk, with the potential to broadly expand the reach of our vaccine candidate both to those aged 18 to 60 with high-risk conditions as well as to pediatrics and adolescents. Our RSV-Flu co-administration study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority for all four flu strains and RSV A and B strains. This suggests the RSV vaccine candidate, if approved, could be co-administered with flu vaccinations and add an important component of seasonal protection against respiratory pathogens. Finally, the FDA recently updated the EUA for our Omicron BA.4/5 bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to enable those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness, including the elderly and the immunocompromised, to partner with their healthcare providers to be proactive in helping protect themselves against COVID-19. We anticipate another update from FDA in June that will provide guidance on COVID-19 vaccine strains and vaccination timing for the 2023 fall and winter seasons. Beyond vaccines, anti-virals are an important component of our strategy in respiratory viruses. Here we share data for the first time from our second generation oral COVID-19 antiviral candidate, a potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor that is currently in Phase 1. We designed this candidate to achieve clinical exposures that would have similar anti-viral activity to PAXLOVID, but without the need for ritonavir boosting and with the potential for reduced drug interactions. Early results from Phase 1 dose escalation are encouraging, with no dose limiting safety or tolerability findings. Dosing achieved concentrations many-fold over in vitro EC90 and is therefore expected to have similar antiviral activity to PAXLOVID. On the right are preliminary results from a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of midazolam drug interaction, which is a well-known standard for indicating CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions. These data show there is a lack of such drug-drug interactions, suggesting there may be no related restrictions of co-dosing with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. Based on these encouraging data, we are planning to advance to a Phase 2 dose ranging study in the first half of 2023. In addition to the assets I spoke about today, we continue to make progress on the pipeline with more than 25 milestones recently achieved or anticipated through the first half of 2024. In inflammation & immunology, the FDA has approved our sNDA for CIBINQO, enabling a label expansion for adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In internal medicine, ZAVZPRET migraine nasal spray has received FDA approval, expanding our migraine portfolio. Recently, the FDA Advisory Committee voted in support of PAXLOVID's favorable benefit-risk profile, with a soon PDUFA date in May. In closing, we are very excited about the potentially transformative catalysts expressed across the pipeline as we work with continued urgency to bring breakthroughs to patients. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session. We are very excited about the next gen CDK4 inhibitor. It's looking really good in two aspects. You can dose and get the activity of the patient's Pal CDK4/6 because you deal with higher inhibition of this mechanism, and you have a better tolerability with no -- with much less neutropenia, less risk for infections. We expect media to report out and we have an aspirational target to start Phase 3, late this year posted earlier. At the same time as you asked, we are now running combination study CDK4 with CAT6, another inhibitor that has nice single agent activity and seem to combine well. We have a second combination with CDK2 and we think this would allow us next year to pick one or two combinations to advance up the lines with more potent treatment than what's available today. Similarly, we're looking at combination with 471, as you alluded to in order to benefit from Arvinas' collaboration. Next gen Paxlovid, yes, as alluded to in my introductory remarks, we have manifold above EC90. And as you know, for Paxlovid what's unique with that drug that the many fold exposure above EC90 as these four lead to no detectable meaningful emergence or mutations, which is always what you fear in antiviral single agent therapy. And this has been unique for Paxlovid versus other agents that have been used to for whether antibodies or antivirals. And this is exactly the profile for the next gen, but without the DDIs that allow us to improve and also to move into other supplementary segments. We're planning soon to start a Phase 2. And pending data possibly move quickly to Phase 3. And of course, we would like to see that agent introduced as soon as possible, I think we can hope to move swiftly pending event rates of COVID that will happen in the fall and further on that influence enrollment. So I think you said '26 and I would certainly hope we'd be ahead of that. You know, we are very pleased what we see so far the totality, date of our few mRNA. As you know, we have reported out very high antibody titers to A, similar or possibly lower to the B antigens versus standard flu vaccines. But in contrast to standard flu vaccines, we have very nice T cell activity. And I think we are the only mRNA platform that has those CD4 and CD8 T cells of significance. We do think that could offer a unique profile for flu and the tolerability with our dose is very encouraging. So, the trial is in the last leg for readout. Hopefully, we'll be late to this for to share an update. And we are very encouraged and we are in parallel at least investing in combination opportunities with this and COVID and RSV in various combination as Albert early alluded to. Yes, we are very excited about our two oral GLP, the 1532 and Danuglipron 1530 called Lotiglipron, and we're looking for a differentiated profile that will be a combination of rapid onset, high control of HbA1C bringing it down, and bodyweight loss at various doses to be very competitive, and a more easily tight treble drag that can optimize a preferred profile versus injectable when it comes to nausea and other well known effects. So, we look forward very much to data. Maybe later this year or possibly early next year and cherry pick the winner here. You also asked about the DMD, well if there is approval, it is based just on surrogate markers and in this area, I think it's very important to report out data, when it comes to real patient benefit. And we expect possibly already late this year, alternatively next year to have data from the first randomized study that if positive could show favorable benefit for patients doing better according to the North Star scale. So we feel really positive about our own DMD program and I think the entry will be competitive with the real data that patients need. Yes. We are extremely excited about the RSV vaccine and we'll provide data on co-administration of that vaccine with the advent of flu. We expect you to be available and generalize to all flu vaccines. And then when it comes to longer term, we also are already in combination study with our RSV and using our internal portfolio of COVID and mRNA flu, so we see this as an event developing a very strong portfolio this year with co-administration opportunities next year, possibly our own flu vaccine and then combination thereof. So stay tuned. Yes. No, we agree completely with you that we should have an ambitious profile. And we have certainly seen patients up to 15% weight loss, depending on different dose regimens. So for obesity, that's a really good ambition to have up to 15%. And for diabetes patients, of course, it's about having a very strong HbA1c lowering maybe 2% or even more. So, we think it's feasible with all roles. And we think that will open up a very large place. And we think that pending data readout that we may have a differentiated profile for our full agonists. Yes. I mean, we are extremely excited about the PCV20 recent pediatric approval with a Stellar label reflecting the strengths of our data. We monitor carefully competitor activity, as you alluded to, and are planning ourselves to enter next year further expanded PCV vaccines, followed by additional expansion a few years later, including optimization of the conjugation procedures, including different carriers, and possibly for the adult also had adjuvant that we think could be useful. So this is a market where we have been the leaders were having a unique platform, and we monitor and feel very confident that we are going to have a bright future, although you mentioned competitor, which is a nature of markets that are becoming of course more saturated like the adult market, but there will also hope to benefit from our broader portfolio of respiratory vaccines from COVID flu RSV, that cannot be much harder at the moment. The secret sauce in this particular trial is a new adjuvant that we think could play and potential nice role in the PCV adult market as you go to increasing balance in this face. As I said before, in parallel, we are working on looking at different carriers, different chemistries, and we will shortly reveal for next year a start of a broader expanded PCV vaccine that will cooperate all these learnings. So stay tuned. Yes, we were very pleased to get our first data chunk from second season mid-season data for older adults. And it clearly shows that robust data that we shared, for example, we shared high 80% reduction in lower respiratory tract infections with three symptoms. We see also on this and similar on other endpoint, a very robust, very meaningful protection also in the second season. Now, as you know, at the same time, we are preparing for the future combination vaccines. And we think in general that you will see an evolution in the adult market with simplified vaccination schedule, and your revaccination of COVID flu RSV. For those that for some reason, these are vaccination, we think the second season data will be very good. On the maternal, we are preparing for an advisory committee, we think we have great data, we are the only one that have been able to conclude the maternal vaccination, we're the only one that we're able to construct an RSV vaccine without using an adjuvant. And we think it's a differentiated product, and I assume will be sooner after a potential approval and opportunity for Angela to launch to very eagerly awaiting community of increasingly attentive pregnant women and maternal clinics to protect the newborn."

            "name": "Angela Hwang",
            "content": "So from a launch perspective, I think the two big ones to look out for this year are Prevnar 20 EPS, and RSP adults. And as you know, it goes through the typical ACIP process or recommendation, and then launches can really only happen or commercialization after the publication of the MWR. So if you consider all of that, that puts us into fourth quarter, which is when Prevnar 20, as well as when RSV older adults will actually be commercialized, and revenue being generated. And so yes, we are anticipating that there's going to be a big bolus of revenue because, first of all, if you think about Prevnar 20 Peds, that is going to be a conversion from Prevnar 20 Peds and Prevnar 13 today has a significant market share, right, in the pediatric pneumococcal, is 80% margin share. So, we are going to be converting those accounts, the physicians, the inventory, all of that from 13 over to 20. And so if you look at, I guess a good analog for that would be our Prevnar 20 adult launch, which was the conversion of the Prevnar 20 adult launch, and there it went really well. Today, we have what, over 95 market share. And then of course the second one is the RSV adult, and there, it plugs into an already established commercial infrastructure that we have built around COVID, around the Prevnar franchise, the adult franchise. It comes at a great time during the fall and the winter when vaccinations for respiratory vaccines actually increases. So, there is a lot of reasons to believe why their fourth quarter and it'll be a really big quarter for both Prevnar Peds as well as RSV adults. Sure. Yes. So we are incredibly proud of the work that we have done with Nurtec since the acquisition. As you know, in July of 2022, we had already begun and copromote with Biohaven to ensure that we were copromoting the product early. And I think that has really paid off. If you really look at what has happened from it, just leading indicators as well as actuals. Today, Nurtec is the leading product in the oral CGRP class with over 47.5% market share. It is also the leading product when it comes to new to brand prescription share at a high of 46%. It also has the highest number of prescribers at over 110,000 prescribers and 80% of new CGRP prescribers choose Nurtec. So, I think we've demonstrated in the time that we've had it, that we are able to drive performance and drive excellent education and awareness of the product. And we're seeing that consistent great metrics as it pertains to Nurtec. And of course, the opportunity is huge, right because we have so pan Japan launching later this year. And we also know that, as a whole, there are over 1 billion migraine sufferers and only 18% of them are using CRPS today. So, we have a great opportunity to expand the class of CGRP with specifically Nurtec. Maybe just to add to your question specifically about the adult portfolio, I really do believe that, this plays into our sweet spot. Through the last several years, both from or the Prevnar franchise for vaccinating adults throughout work in COVID, we have learned that, the clinical profile is one thing, but you really need reliable supply, you need a commercial infrastructure, you need a great ability to educate, raise awareness and drive people to vaccination. And I think on all of those counts, Pfizer is a winner. And so, we look forward to having a growing and a very robust respiratory portfolio that really leverages off of this incredible commercial machinery. So, Louise, as you know, both of these products, both Comirnaty and Paxlovid, our products are very familiar to us. They fit very well in the the existing portfolio of products that we have. So the ability for us to move from an EUA into a full launch or into its business as usual for us, right? So, the typical things that we would always do which is awareness building with physicians and with patients that has begun and is well on the way. The things that you would do as a regard to our discussions with payers to demonstrate value and to create your value arguments for reimbursement and access that has begun. We have done a tremendous amount of work, as it pertains to retailers and making sure that, we have our distribution and our supply chain, well-oiled and the ability to be able to supply and to vaccinate to administer these products at both at a physical site, like a retailer or even in the case of Paxlovid getting telehealth and sort of remote health capabilities set up. So all of these capabilities, many of them, in fact, have been underway throughout the entire time of the pandemic. So I think we are in a very, very good position to seamlessly transition into commercialization. Sure. Well, I think to answer that question you really have to look at each product and the specific disease that they are in. So, let's start with elranatamab, which is UC. There, we believe that we have an advantage from a clinical profile perspective. We believe that we have the best class S1B inhibitor, but there are also other great benefits such as the fact that, it can be used steroid free that we have convenient dosing. We also offer an oral option in a world that is very prevalent with injectables. And even with all of that, that's out there, we still have 50% of people that have not achieved remission. So I think that the unmet need in UC is clear. And for us, in particular, given the profile of elranatamab, what we think is the greatest opportunity for us is in earlier lines of treatment where there has not been as much transmit, right? There's a lot of anti-TNF, there is a lot of biosimilars, there's JAF, there's other mechanisms, but in earlier lines of treatment. There really is not enough. And so that's where we think we have an opportunity to meet an underserved need today and that's where we're going to be -- that's where we're going to be positioning, elranatamab. ritlecitinib is a different story when you look at that particular indication for alopecia that is really an under developed market. The 3 million people today, they're no great options for adults and there are absolutely no options for adolescents and children. And so the profile that we have with ritlecitinib, it's the best-in-class JAK, it's the best JAK. And I think that we're going to compete well. In addition to the fact that we're going to be the only JAK compared to ritlecitinib that has an indication for adolescents. So, I think in this regard because it's a new disease or a highly undeserved disease, I think education and awareness, education at the level of the prescriber, the patient, but also with the payers is going to be key to our ability to access this market. Well, with all launches, education is really important and that's why we have already begun our unbranded disease education with physicians laying the groundwork for the importance of vaccinating with or vaccinating for RSV. But of course, with all launches and with all new diseases, an education is important to consumers, it's important to caregivers, to payers and so on all of those fronts. Those discussions have either begun or are beginning, and we plan to obviously implement a robust market development plan like we do for all of our vaccines. However, I think that the biggest advantage here is in the synergies of RSV together with our other adult vaccines, right. We have now 20 adults. We have had COVID. All of these vaccines follow a very similar pattern in terms of the commercial needs that they have. And I think that we have the opportunity to quickly and seamless bring RSV on into our portfolio and use the very same approaches and mechanisms and the same conversations that were -- whether it's with a retailer, whether it's air, whether it's with our points of vaccinations to bring RSV on. So actually, I think that this is a very exciting time, and we feel very confident about the ability to seamlessly introduce RSV as another vaccine in our respiratory portfolio. Sure. So, after April, we continue to have Paxlovid available and but it will be assessed through an out of pocket payment mechanism. So if you are a private patient, you can get it. If you're a public patient, you can get it, you just need to be able to pay up pocket for it. And we intend to continue to work with the public and with the Chinese Government to ensure its access. Sure. Hi, Chris. Yes. We are preparing for launch now. But as we have said, we have shared before the date of launch and exactly how that's going to happen is still very much subject to our discussions with the U.S. Government. So, we are going to align with guidance from them in terms of how that's going to happen. Of course, in the meantime, we are preparing for the commercialization of Paxlovid and payer discussions around the world is critical. So, those have begun. Obviously, it's too early for me to share the price of Paxlovid. But suffice to say that, the price ranges that we have brought to our payers together with the value arguments that we have been able to develop through robust real world evidence from the number hospitalizations, the number of deaths that we have been able to avert through the treatment with Paxlovid is very much supportive of the pricing ranges that we are talking about. So, I think very soon we will be able to share more."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nFrancesca DeMartino: Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Members of our leadership team will be available for the Q&A session, including Dr. Andrew Baum, who recently joined Pfizer as EVP and Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our team continues to execute, and we are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. We are guided by our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives. And I'm proud that we have reached more than 270 million patients with our medicines and vaccines through the first 9 months of 2024. The focus on execution excellence is starting to deliver results with market share gains in the U.S. and international as well as robust growth in revenues and EPS. As a result, we are raising guidance ranges and for our full year 2024 total revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share. In January, we presented the 5 key priorities that would guide Pfizer during our year of execution. Today, you will hear how we advanced our business in the third quarter with each of the strategic priorities. I will focus on highlights, showing our progress with the first 3. Dave will discuss our continued work to reduce our cost base, expand our margins and strategically deploy our capital. Then we will review our financial performance during the quarter and explain why we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term value for shareholders, and then we will take questions. So with that, I'll turn to our performance against our priorities during the quarter. Stated simply, Oncology is having a great year and delivered another quarter of strong performance, with 31% year-over-year performance growth resulting from solid demand across our product portfolio that includes legacy Seagen and legacy Pfizer products. We set a goal to achieve world-class Oncology leaders. In the U.S., we are already the third largest biopharma company in oncology by revenue through the first half of 2024, and we are proud of the progress we are making toward our goal. Demand continued to increase for XTANDI, the market leader for 4 types of advanced prostate cancer, grew 28% year-over-year. TALZENNA grew by 77% in the quarter versus the same quarter from a year ago. We are encouraged by the opportunity to further advance the prostate cancer treatment landscape based on the exciting overall survival data we announced earlier this month from the Phase III TALAPRO study. TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer becoming the first and only such combination to do so. Driving scientific breakthroughs in -- cancer is one of the key areas of focus in Oncology. The TALAPRO-2 results show how we continue innovating to improve survival for men with prostate cancer, which is the second most common cancer in men and the fifth most common cause of cancer death among men worldwide. We saw continued momentum during the quarter with the ongoing launch of PADCEV with pembrolizumab for patients with advanced metastatic bladder cancer, regardless of their eligibility to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This combination has quickly become the most prescribed first-line treatment in the U.S. for locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. In thoracic cancer, we achieved 31% operational growth this quarter with LORBRENA, a treatment for adult with alpositive metastatic noncell lung cancer. Following the release of our 5 years of CROWN data during the ASPA Neal meeting, we are observing an acceleration of first-line new patient starts around the world and in particular, in our key markets of the U.S., China, Germany and France. Our BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI combination also -- strong year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 32%, primarily driven by growth in the metastatic non-small cell cancer indications. And we continue to be pleased by strong performance with the launch of ELREXFIO, which had about 80% sequential revenue growth over the second quarter of 2024. In the U.S., we have more than doubled our new patient starts since January. In Japan, we were able to catch up with competition and launch as the first to market, BCMA bispecific, helping address an unmet medical need for patients with triple class exposed multiple myeloma. We believe ELREXFIO has the potential to be a transformative treatment option for people with multiple myeloma and we are continuing to advance development with 4 ongoing registrational studies in earlier lines of therapy, but if positive and approved, could support serving a way more expanded patient population. Now I will turn to some select highlights of our continued strategical advancing our pipeline. We are prioritizing opportunities where we have scientific leadership and deep capabilities to address significant unmet patient needs. Earlier, I spoke to the strength of our market Oncology medicines. Our pipeline, however, is what excites us the most. Lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer-related death around the world. At the recent ESMO counts with our long-term follow-up results from FOREST trial, evaluating BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in patients with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, which demonstrated compelling efficacy for patients. We are also rapidly advancing to next-generation ADC candidates with the potential to make significant impact on the more than 300,000 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. The first is [indiscernible], which is now in Phase III, and we are planning additional -- trials in the coming months. The other one is a PD-L1 AV ADC. We are equally encouraged by the updated Phase I data we presented the ESMO for this ADC, and we are planning rotation enabling trials in 2025. Our [indiscernible] pipeline is expanding. We are studying another novel ADC, [indiscernible] in 2 ongoing registration intended trials in unfilial cancer. And MEBROMETOSTAN, our novel EZH2 inhibitor is another example of the progress we are making throughout our pipeline. This has been starting as a new potential treatment for men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and we are enrolling currently patients into Phase III studies. Finally, to build on the foundation for our drugs, we are making progress with development of 2 candidates we believe can replace the current backbones of HER positive HER2 negative breast cancer. Atirmociclib, our potential first-in-class CDK4 inhibitor is enrolling a second line Phase III trial, and we expect to start a first line Phase III study by early 2025. And we expect the first Phase III data in the coming months for vepdegestrant, an Eastern receptor [indiscernible] that we are codeveloping right now with [indiscernible]. Our fourth generation PCB candidate now in Phase II adult and pediatrics, covers 25 serotypes, including improved immunogenicity for serotype 3, very important, which is one of the largest remaining contributors of disease. We are focused on building on our leadership in the industry by continuing to expand balance sheet with our fifth generation candidate, which is in preclinical development that covers over 30 serotype. In the last several months, we have advanced the potential new vaccine against Seba, which is considered and urgent public health threat that lacks any approved vaccines. Leveraging experience from our previous STEP program, we have developed a new formulation for a second-generation candidate. After encouraging Phase I data with this new formulation, we have advanced our Phase II study already. We are also working to support significant need for about 90 million Americans and 200 million Europeans in areas with high incidence of lime disease. VLA15 is a vaccine candidate we are codeveloping that is intended to protect against the 6 most prevalent serotypes in North America and Europe. A Phase III trial is underway, and pending positive data and regulatory approval, VLA15 would become the only vaccine available to help prevent the acute severe and long-term health consequences of lime disease global. TAXICOVID is the standard of care COMIRNATY in oral treatment for those at high risk of progressing to severe disease. We believe, however, that there is an opportunity to expand both our therapeutic impact and market position where our next-generation oral antiviral candidate, EBUSATRELVI. In a Phase II study, we have demonstrated a robust antiviral activity at all doses and without the need for returnable boosting. We have addressed the drug-drug interactions and the metallic taste associated with TAXICOVID. We expect to start a Phase III study in the coming months. We are also moving forward with our Phase III program in nonsegmental vitiligo with ritlecitinib, a candidate with a differentiated JAK mechanism developed in-house at Pfizer that has the potential to be an expansion of indications for [indiscernible], which is currently approved in severe alopecia areata. Vitiligo, like alopecia areata , an autoimmune disease with high unmet need. It is the leading cause for skin depigmentation and affects nearly 3 million patients in the U.S. alone. We are also enthusiastic about our 2 first-in-class trispecific antibodies with early data demonstrating excellent 3-in-1 potency. We believe this program has the potential to deliver improved efficacy in atopic dermatitis with an ongoing Phase II study evaluating safety and efficacy. We had a Phase II readout of ponsegromab, which is another in-house discovered and developed by us. We are encouraged by the potential for a breakthrough for patients with cancer cachexia, who lack treatment options for this life whitening wasting condition that currently has no FDA-approved treatments. The Phase II study met its primary endpoints change from baseline in body weight compared to placebo across all dose tests. And the highest dose of [indiscernible], sought improvements for baseline in appetite, cachexia symptoms, physical activity and muscle mass. Based on these positive results, we expect to advance to a registration-enabling study next year. Our Phase II study in patients with heart failure related cachexia is ongoing. We remain on track with our dose optimization studies for danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist candidate and look forward to discussing more about this in early 2025. In our broader obesity portfolio, we continue to advance our early-stage candidates, including our oral small module GIPR antagonist, which is advancing to Phase II in 2024 this year. And in additional, all once daily oral GLP-1 receptor agonist in Phase I. The highlights, I mentioned today across important therapeutic areas show how we have made meaningful advancements with our pipeline. As we announced earlier this year, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's Chief Scientific Officer, will depart from Pfizer after 15 years of leading Pfizer's research efforts. Our progress for selecting a successor is not quite advanced, and we look forward to announcing an update soon. Now I will turn to our commercial performance. And another one of our strategic priorities is maximizing the performance of our new products. I'm pleased that the decisive actions we took to enhance our commercial organization at the beginning of the year are giving satisfactory results. With NURTEC, we saw 28% total prescription growth and continued leadership in the oral [indiscernible] class. Importantly, 85% of primary care clinicians writing CGRP prescriptions first time [indiscernible] NURTEC, 85%. This shows the progress we are making in primary care as well as our work with payers to remove barriers for timely patient access to treatment. Among our vaccines, we are very pleased with our performance since the launch of Prevnar20, which has already achieved 83% market in pediatric and 97% in adults. With last week's recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to expand adult pneumococcal vaccination to include all adults age 50 and older, we believe Prevnar20 is well positioned to serve and expand the population in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we are predominantly serving the pediatric market. And following the recent first quarter approval in Japan and EU, we are gaining vaccine technical committee recommendations and several market in programs. With ABRYSVO, we continued improving our U.S. market acquisition with strong commercial execution. Our market share of sales, retailers and clinics out of wholesalers has exceeded 50% for the quarter. And our market set of shots in arms in the [indiscernible] setting has increased for 9 consecutive weeks through mid-October, currently reaching 43%. Last week's FDA approval for ABRYSVO for patients 18 through 59 who are at increased risk of low respirable drug disease caused by RSV, could help a serve and expand the population over time. With the rise in COVID-19 infection in the summer and early fall, we have responded to increased demand for PAXLOVID as we launched in the U.S. commercial market at the beginning of the year. Our better-than-expected growth during the quarter for PAXLOVID reflects higher inflection rates and the strong commercial execution of our team. Our ability to execute effectively includes improving patient actions, raising awareness of this treatment option, expanding use of alternative sites of care and also continuing to educate health care providers. The demand for PAXLOVID have stabilized. In the slide, you can see the total number of patients treated with PAXLOVID in '24, which is very similar to the same period in '23. It appears to be closely correlated with its weight of COVID-19, but also appear to have very similar pattern in '23 and '24. The 63% operational growth in the third quarter of our VYNDAQEL family of products is a direct result of our progress in expanding the health care provider base and supporting clinicians in identifying more patients who can benefit from this therapy, as well as our work to improve patient access and adherence to therapy. Internationally, VYNDAQEL is reimbursed in 44 markets right now and more affected next year. While that integrates value across markets, the unmet [indiscernible] remains significant as restated by the 10% increase of patients on treatment in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2024 in the U.S. We were pleased by the 74% quarterly operational growth and continued progress with expanding access with CIBINQO, a treatment for patients 12 and up with moderate to severe eczema who didn't respond to other treatments and 27% growth in the U.S. on the second to third quarters of 2024. With Litfulo, the first and only FDA-approved prescription pill for both adults and adolescents as young as 12 with severe alopecia areata. Now, and I will turn it over to Dave.\nDave Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I will build on Albert's comments by reinforcing that we are very pleased with the financial results for the third quarter of 2024. These results demonstrate that our focus and our execution against our 5 strategic priorities are driving positive patient outcomes and continued financial and operational strength. In addition to our strong top line performance, our cost reduction programs are creating a more efficient organization, setting the stage for increased capital returns and supporting our commitment to both maintaining and growing our dividend, all while enhancing shareholder value. This morning, I will briefly review our Q3 P&L performance, I'll highlight our capital allocation priorities and touch upon our full year 2024 financial guidance. Additionally, as we approach the end of the year, I will also share several modeling considerations as we began to plan for 2025. Turning first to the third quarter performance versus the same period of last year. Let me walk on the P&L. Total company revenues were $17.7 billion, representing an impressive 32% operational growth. Our COVID-19 products were significant contributors with PAXLOVID generating $2.7 billion in revenue. This included $442 million related to delivering 1 million treatment courses to the U.S. Government Strategic National Stockpile. COMIRNATY, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed $1.4 billion in revenue. Our COVID-19 products were not the only drivers during the quarter. Our non-COVID products also exhibited robust performance with revenues of $13.6 billion, reflecting 14% operational year-over-year growth. This performance shows that our refined commercial approach is working. We continue to focus on key products and geographies, we've refined how we allocate our commercial field resources globally and we're further optimizing our marketing resources into key priority areas. We saw strong contribution from our recently acquired Seagen products, including Passive, which continues its momentum following the results of the EV302 study last year. Other key growth drivers included VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS, XTANDI and NURTEC, partially offset by declines in Xeljanz and Ibrance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter is approximately 70%, primarily the result of a net unfavorable mix related to our COVID-19 products, primarily due to the COMIRNATY profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses, as well as a slight dampening due to the associated costs incurred with the withdrawal of Oxbryta. All of this was partially offset by our ongoing focus on cost management across our manufacturing network. We continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s for the full year. And as previously communicated, long-term improvements in gross margins will remain a key focus for the company over the next several years. We expect to achieve savings from Phase I of our manufacturing optimization program beginning in 2025 and deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings for the first phase by the end of 2027. In parallel, we continue to evaluate our strategy for both Phase II and Phase III, which will focus on network structure and product portfolio, respectively. And we expect to have more information to share on those components of the program once they become available. Total adjusted operating expenses decreased 2% operationally to $5.8 billion. And I will note that this amount includes spending acquired via our Seagen transaction. And looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally, driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products partly offset by a reduction in the U.S. health care reform fees. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 4% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending on certain vaccine programs as well as our cost realignment program, partially offset by an increased spending related to the Seagen acquisition. We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management and remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion in net cost savings from our cost realignment program by year-end. Q3 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.78 in the quarter and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.06, benefiting from our top line performance and efficient operating structure as well as a favorable tax rate driven primarily by jurisdictional mix. As mentioned last quarter, unique onetime items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results this quarter include a $420 million charge related to the expected sale of one of our facilities, resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program earlier this year. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of both maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. In the first 9 months of '24, we returned $7.1 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D and as we expected, completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to delevering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25x remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have delevered by approximately $4.4 billion, paying down approximately $2.3 billion in maturing debt and approximately $2.1 billion in commercial paper. And in October, we monetized another tranche of our Helion shares, which for reporting purposes is a Q4 event. We received approximately $3.5 billion in net cap proceeds, and our ownership in Helion was reduced from approximately 23% to approximately 15%. Year-to-date, we have received approximately $6.9 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of our shares. We intend to monetize our remaining Helion investment in a prudent fashion considering our cash flow requirements and future market conditions. Overall, in Q3, we generated robust operating cash flows, which combined with the Helion net sale proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, resulting in significant cash flow generation as we enter the fourth quarter. Our objective remains to delever and return to a more balanced allocation of capital between reinvestment and direct return to shareholders over time. Now let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the full year. Based on our focused execution and strong year-to-date results, we are raising our full year '24 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30. We now expect revenues in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion and operational revenue growth, excluding COVID-19 products is unchanged at 9% to 11% and takes into consideration reduction of sales associated with Oxbryta. COVID-19 product revenues are now expected to be $10.5 billion, $5 billion for COMIRNATY and $5.5 billion for PAXLOVID. Our guidance for adjusted SI&A, adjusted R&D and our effective tax rate on adjusted income remains unchanged. And last, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.95, primarily reflecting the top line increase and absorbing the Oxbryta impact. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs. Now as we begin to look towards next year, I want to touch on a few modeling considerations. As we've previously discussed, there are several nonrecurring items included in our 2024 results. First, during 2024, PAXLOVID revenue included a U.S. government revenue credit true-up and the fulfillment of our obligation to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile. Second, given our ownership of Helion is now below 20%, we will no longer record equity income from that investment in our adjusted earnings beginning in 2025. And finally, our 2024 tax rate on adjusted income was favorably impacted by timing with respect to the impact of Pillar 2 and to a lesser extent, audit settlements. All in, these items are expected to have a favorable impact on full year 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.30. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter 2024 results and our overall performance this year. Our team remains dedicated to strong operational execution, and we believe our cost-saving programs will drive enhanced operating leverage over time that will enable us to consistently deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders. We are committed to driving long-term value creation through scientific leadership, portfolio strength and productivity across all aspects of our business. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thanks, Dave. It's time for the Q&A. But before we take our first question, I want to briefly address the topic that I know is in the minds of many. We seek to be attentive to our shareholders and are always open to hearing their perspective. We had a meeting with Starboard Value 2 weeks ago. I was there with our Lead Director and our Head of Investor Relations. The meeting was constructive and [indiscernible]. They presented the same deck they made public last week. And given the proximity to our quarterly earnings day, we were mainly in listening mode. While we agree with some of the points they raised, we have vastly different views on many others. For example, they expressed dissatisfaction with our total shareholder return. We are not satisfied either, though we believe we are executing on the best path forward to increase shareholder return. On the other hand, they challenged our capital deployment for business development. We believe that our deals will produce significant shareholder returns, and some of them like Seagen or BioNTech have been transformational for Pfizer. The important thing is what we do to improve performance. In January, we presented a 5-point [indiscernible] aiming to create shareholder value that has guided our decision-making all year long. We remain focused on executing this plan and on delivering for our commitments, including driving long-term shareholder value. We will engage productively with our shareholders, including Starboard, and will consider all good ideas that are offering. And with that, operator, please assemble the queue to discuss our third quarter performance and pipeline.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: I wanted to ask questions about the pipeline, particularly with regard to obesity, where we appreciate the additional insights into what you have in the clinic. Albert, you previously said that you believe that Pfizer could be the #2 company on the market with an oral. That would imply that danuglipron is the lead asset there, however, you do have 2 additional assets that we find intriguing at a GP-1 oral that is in Phase I that is once a day, but would clearly be behind. And then now an oral GIP antagonist, which I think is a source of debate. Can you frame what your strategy is, how important it is to be second to market versus perhaps having a differentiated approach with these 2 assets?\nAlbert Bourla: Look, I will ask Mikael to comment because there is a lot of activities going on right now, all that. But my general comment is that, as I have said, if Daniel moves fast based on what we know right now, we should be the second oral into the market, provided that the first one will be successful and the other ones will not come before us. But so far, this is what the situation looks like. The market is very, very large. And there is a significant need for oral solutions. We know that. So there is no doubt that if successful, we will have our decent market share of oral. But the important thing it is that obesity market is developing, let's say, nicely also in terms of science, and we are exploring several other opportunities right now. The two that we have mentioned in the clinic, Mikael Michael can speak a little bit more, both about the danu and the other two, Mikael.\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you, Albert. Yes, as you heard in Albert\u2019s remarks before the meeting, we continue to execute on our danuglipron plan, which includes a once-a-day profile with a modified release type of system. And we do believe that once a day with modified release could have some really special features and bringing that as a second oral would help really to have a strong foot into that market, in the same way, we have seen injectable being split etweenn 2 different products. I don\u2019t expect that the various oral will, in the end, differ that much in the GLP-1 class. So that\u2019s why we were keen also to move a GIFR, which could add better tolerability and more efficacy. And we\u2019re right now, initiating Phase II studies on the backbone of [indiscernible] engines. And these are our 2 more advanced bets, plus we always like to bring in this huge segment in drives and have more options as we advance. And you\u2019ve heard there are so many applications for GLP-1s, and that\u2019s why we have a second once-a-day again.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist.\nKripa Devarakonda: I have actually a question on your recent data from fensegrumab program in cachexia. You reported positive Phase II data. And just broadly speaking, this program has been previously highlighted as well. For the registrational trial, would a trial that replicate your Phase II in a larger group of patients be sufficient? Or would you need to show outcomes like survival? And also, adding away details of the registrational trial, can you help us understand how big of an opportunity you see for this drug?\nAlbert Bourla: Let's start with Mikael a little bit on the science, and then maybe Andrew can speak about the potential market size of the [indiscernible].\nMikael Dolsten: I think in general, for cancer agents, and this is more in the supported care, we're addressing segments of unmet patient needs, which relates to be able to regain the performance status with better body weight, have higher physical activity and be able to go through more treatment cycles, which should often translate to better long-term survival. As you know, that is always dependent on how patients cross over to different trials. So I do think initial registration will come from similar endpoint as in our Phase II studies, but we clearly aim to translate better patient performance to other outcomes that are more harder endpoint going through more treatment cycle and treatment that, call it, with better cancer outcome over time. And this is -- will be shown in multiple cancer types. So we do think similar to other product that earlier have been heavily used in support of cancer care, this could be a very large opportunity. And in addition to that, we are running a heart failure studies and looking at a third opportunity, also large chronic disease. And with that, Andrew, some comments on the potential of this molecule?\nAlbert Bourla: Yes, correct. And building on Mikael\u2019s comments, look, Extia is a massive unmet medical need. It\u2019s 50% to 80% of patients with oncology, suffer from that, particularly, as you know, within pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. It\u2019s probably about 20% to 30% in heart failure and COPD. The size of the market really depends on whether it\u2019s viewed as a supportive care therapy. But also, obviously, as Mikael mentioned, whether you have outcome benefit. And obviously, depending on the outcome of those trials, we\u2019re going to be looking at different price points. So the size of the market or particularly the size of this drug is going to be very much informed by the data that we deliver in the pending Phase II and Phase III trials.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I feel like it's still very early in your engagement with some of your shareholders and the new shareholders. So perhaps it might be too premature to ask much further on that. So instead, maybe I'll focus on pipeline briefly. I know you mentioned, Michael, that the oral GIP antagonist adds better tolerability and more efficacy. It sounded like you were implying it's more incremental to what an oral GLP could do as a stand-alone. Could you just lay that into context, for example, in the 4-week Phase I study you ran, did it hit 4% to 5% weight loss? And secondly, the more than 30-valent pneumococcal vaccine that you guys disclosed this morning, does it have more than one carrier protein?\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. I think the ability of GIPR to act in concert with GLP-1 has been well documented in a few different peptide settings. So we aim to be the first to document this with an oral approach, and that could offer a really nice differentiation for patients that need more and faster achieving of the treatment objectives. That's what we want to reveal right now. On the -- our new platform for PCV generation 4 and 5, we include a number of technical improvements. We don't want to disclose those today, but we did -- we're open to mention that our PCV fourth generation, which covers 25 serotypes have as an example and improved serotype 3 based on new technology that moves it far beyond what we believe any other technology has been able to accomplish. And why is that important? Well, serotype 3 covers somewhere between 15% to 30% of disease in different countries and improving on that can have a bigger impact than adding a number of rather infrequent serotypes. As we go to the more than 30 valent, it will be a combination of such improvement and many more serotypes.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Trung Huynh with UBS.\nTrung Huynh: Sorry, I was on mute there, Trung Huynh from UBS. I have two. So thanks very much for the comments on the activist investor. You said you disagreed with the thoughts over capital deployment and then you cited significant shareholder returns for Seagen and BioNTech. What's the difference between what you're thinking and perhaps what the Street is thinking here on BD? And then how do you intend to restore that and restore confidence back into the company, so that bridge between your expectations and the Street can be aligned? And then just on your commitment to delever, and thanks for the comments on the prepared remarks here. Is there an appetite to delever even quicker and sell the hospital business and [indiscernible] the Helion stake earlier? And you do have products going off with LOE soon. That could give you a little bit more flexibility on the balance sheet. So yes, just thoughts here.\nAlbert Bourla: Why don't we start with this one and then I'll take a little bit the activist question.\nDave Denton: Yes. So first, on the levering point, yes, our objective is to delever as rapidly as possible. And I think the company has been laser focused on doing that, given the fact that we've taken out about $4.4 billion in debt year-to-date, and we'll continue to do that. Secondly, without speaking directly around any potential BD opportunities here, is we're always looking to evaluate the infrastructure that we have and the assets that we currently maintain and understand if there's availability to, I'll say, monetize some of those assets over time to further support our delevering activity. So I would say all options are on the table, and we'll continue to evaluate on what makes the most sense for us strategically long term.\nAlbert Bourla: As regards the \u2013 our projections compared to the Street projections in the business development. First of all, let\u2019s start by saying that by far, the 2 biggest Seagen and BioNTech in terms of revenues, right? And in both as, I think the Street move on seem way up compared to when we made the deal. And upon the [indiscernible] we are very, very stable. The other ones that also \u2013if you add to that, the Biohaven with NURTEC, which we are on our plans and we just exceeded for the second quarter, Street expectations, it is covering 80% of the investments that we have made and probably weigh more in terms of revenues. And the most important thing is that those Seagen, for example, or the BioNTech with our development of mRNA infrastructure around the world. And the Seagen acquisition with our taking over the ADC technology of [indiscernible] was a unique, unique asset is transformational for Pfizer. It\u2019s not the revenue growth, but we are seeing right now, and we\u2019ll continue seeing all the way towards the end of the decade. But it is 2 \u2013 a disease, one already in Phase III, the other is about to start Phase III that we got from Seagen, one the SV and the other, the PDL-1 ADC. Those are mega-blockbusters, if there are technical success, mega-blockbusters. And we are moving to Phase III because we have seen very positive earlier data. The same issue. We\u2019re starting with [indiscernible] cancer, another ADC. So I would say that I think \u2013 we truly think that this was well invested capital and will demonstrate significant value for shareholder. But I want also to make a final comment for any discussion with activists. But no matter if we are agree or disagree on what has happened, I think the most important thing, it is what we are doing going forward. Starboard has not presented any specific actions, but they suggested something needs to change. From that point, in the beginning of the year, already a year ago, we are already starting changing a lot of things. Over the past 10 months, we have implemented changes like we changed our commercial model to separate the U.S. and international business and appointed new leaders who have now delivered 3 consecutive quarters of revenue. And we integrated Seagen and created an end-to-end oncology research organization to ensure a successful integration of the company \u2013 of the Seagen pipeline. And we have retained the vast majority of the legacy Seagen colleagues, and we have delivered multiple, multiple successful readouts from that. We announced a plan to reduce OpEx by $4 billion, which we are executing successfully without negatively affecting the top line. We announced an additional plan to reduce manufacturing costs by $1.5 billion, which so far is delivering satisfactory results. We brought in Andrew Baum, which is a knowledgeable research analyst to help prioritize our R&D pipeline and future business development. We are advancing now the process of selecting a new scientific officer. And we have enhanced our Board with 2 terrific new directors who have deep expertise in corporate governance and shareholder value creation. So what we believe is that all these changes are the result of an intentional 5-point plan that we rolled out already in January of last year. So as I said in my personal, let\u2019s say, remarks, we plan to engage with shareholders, including Starboard and consider any good ideas that create long-term shareholder value. But I don\u2019t think that the statement something needs to change is really pragmatic because it\u2019s coming 15 months late.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So I just had two here. First one, I wanted to ask you is how we should think about the big pushes and pulls for sales and EPS in 2025? And when you might give guidance? Could it be as early as this year? And then second one, just on Seagen, just wondering how the integration is coming along and if you have any updates to some of the metrics that you gave like sales in 2030 and what have you for the Seagen deal?\nAlbert Bourla: Okay. Dave, let's start with the first question.\nDave Denton: Yes. So thank you. Regarding 2025, it's really topical because we're in the middle, as you can imagine, building our 2025 financial plan here across all of our business lines at -- to your point, there's going to be a lot of pushes and pulls as we think about growth into next year on both our core business as well as our COVID business. It is our expectation that we will provide guidance for 2025, most likely by the end of this year. So stay tuned, more to come. We will lay out all the pushes and pulls when we give guidance for 2025, so you can get a very clear understanding of our business and the opportunities to enhance shareholder value longer term.\nAlbert Bourla: Chris, can you give us an update on the Seagen integration, both speak a little bit about the commercial, but also focus on the research, which is a significant value?\nChris Boshoff: Thank you very much for the question. Overall, we're very pleased with the integration to date. We've retained the vast majority of colleagues at legacy Seagen, and we now have over 1,500 colleagues working in our facilities in Basel just outside Seattle. As you saw the global revenue in Q3, we printed $854 million from legacy Seagen and of that, PADCEV printed over $400 million in Q3. Seagen year-to-date delivered for us $2.3 billion, which is 38% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We continue to execute very well on the portfolio, on the pipeline. We started Phase III studies with dasitamab vedotin in urothelial cancer, that\u2019s HER2-low, which is up to 40% of bladder cancer. With Sigotatacvedotin, the differentiated B6A started the first Phase III study in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, that\u2019s where we saw most significant data. And we\u2019re also planning to start the combination of sicotatactedotin pembrolizumab in the first-line setting of non-small cell lung cans and recently discussed and aligned with the FDA on trial design and on the dosing. We\u2019re also progressing and to start a Phase III program with the PD-L1 V, the [indiscernible] in combination with pembrolizumab early next year. So overall, great commercial performance so far. We haven\u2019t missed a beat, and we continue to execute on the pipeline.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Citi.\nGeoff Meacham: Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple of quick ones. Mikael, another one on obesity. And I know you've added assets outside of danuglipron and I appreciate that it's early. I want to ask you, what does success look like on efficacy just given the bar today? And then strategically, how does Pfizer view orals versus longer-acting injectables when you think about the investments Pfizer is making in this category? And then real quick, Albert, on the IRA. Obviously, it seems here to stay. But when you think about the potential for a new administration, what would Pfizer like to see obviously beyond closing the gap between orals and biologics on exclusivity?\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: For orals, to keep it very [indiscernible], I think you have a number of things that could be advantageous. One is, of course, the combined [indiscernible] with all other drugs that are involved in [indiscernible] metabolic disease to give long outcomes. And what you're looking for I would say is 10% to 20% order weight, the lower range of the first GLP. The upper range is where you can see oral combinations edge towards. And that's very much similar to what you can see with the peptide. So I can very broad with a lower and an aspirational range, the lower for more single agents that will edge above that and combi agents that can aspire to go above 15 and edge above that.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Now on [indiscernible] IRA. Clearly, IRA overall is negative for innovation and does not promote a spirit that people could provide investments, but there are also some good things about it. So clearly, I wouldn\u2019t like to see that the out-of-pocket that next year will be $167 per month for all your medicines for seniors. That, we want to be maintained. But this forced price setting [indiscernible] negotiation and also the penalty deal between \u2013 are things that needs to change. And it\u2019s not only on IRA. I would mention that 340B right now, it is one of the biggest issue, and it is unethical and it is the way that it is evolving. And it is creating significant transfer of funds from where it needs to be the [indiscernible] people to booster the profit lines of some business. So 340B reform is something that myself and the entire pharma is setting as a priority. So thank you for your question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Appreciate the questions. Two for me. I guess, first one is on the RSV opportunity. Just wondering what you see as the most likely outcome here for revaccination frequency and the potential impact on the longer-term market opportunity? And then the second question is more of a clarification. On your CDK4 inhibitor, you guided to starting first-line Phase III study early next year. Just wondering if you can share any more detail there on the design, if that would be a head-to-head versus IBRANCE? And if it would be in combo with VFD or if that's a monotherapy type design?\nAlbert Bourla: All right. I mean, would you like to speak a little bit about the RSV and the maybe Terence, to directly answer your question. So how the market evolves, it's going to be a function of how ACIP recommendations for RSV evolve, and that includes revaccination timing, as you mentioned, but also [indiscernible] populations. I don't think it's really productive for us to predict how ACIP is going to evolve these recommendations. But we do feel confident in the Bristow's profile. And importantly, what I would like to highlight is we feel very confident in our ability to pull that profile through. You heard Albert describe our momentum in the U.S. market, particularly in light of dramatic improvements in our market share versus last year. And we continue to be ready to advance in vaccinations in the fourth quarter as well. And the last thing I would say is the FDA's recent approval of the 18- to 59-year-old at-risk population makes ABRYSVO the only RSV vaccine that's indicated to protect patients as young as 18 years of age, and it further strengthens this active on the viability of ABRYSVO. Last thing I'll say is on maternal. We have also had really good momentum on our ABRYSVO maternal indication. We see very strong signals in uptake for the month of September. We had a 20% uptake, which is a full doubling of where we ended the last season. And we continue to see uptake amongst OB/GYNs and health systems. So in the first 4 weeks of this season, the units that we shipped into those systems were up 56% from the first 4 weeks of last season. So we see momentum on ABRYSVO, and we look forward to future [indiscernible] updates.\nAlbert Bourla: And Alexandre, do you want to add something on the international because that's also an important market for us. .\nAlexandre de Germay: Yes, absolutely. Even though it's not material yet, we're actually making very good progress. So on the adult front, we actually got BTC recommendations since the beginning of the year in large markets like U.K., Germany, in France, in Canada, in Australia, in Saudi Arabia and a lot of other midsized market positive share recommendation. Now we're moving into funding. And as you know, at the second quarter, we said that we won the exclusive U.K. tender. That's what we did. We also won the Canadian tender. Now in terms of reimbursement, we just got actually regional reimbursement in Germany, and we are launching [indiscernible] October in Germany. Now all the others, the large market and the client market that I've talked about, are in phase of negotiation. On the other side, the last thing I want to say is actually, we are working toward our immunobridging study in 2025 in China, so that we can do an NDA filing, which is also an important market for us. On the pediatric side, also, we are making good progress. We also got BTC recommendation in large markets like the U.K., in France, in Australia, in several other midsized markets. And actually, yesterday, we just got also the Pan-American Health Organization that covers 40 market in the Americas, that actually leased ABRYSVO in the RSV recommendation. So we're gaining also reimbursements in France. And we have actually just launched in France recently. There, again, on pediatric, once we got all those positive recommendations, we are moving into reimbursements. So we see great potential. It's going to take a bit of time because we go through all those statement steps, but we see good potential there. Absolutely.\nAlbert Bourla: And then why don't we go to Chris for the question on the design of the Phase III.\nChris Boshoff: Thank you very much for the question. On atormocyclib, our highly selective CDK4 inhibitor. This was another small molecule that was conceptualized and discovered in our laboratories in La Jolla. And as you know, it\u2019s currently in a Phase III program for second line plus hormone receptor positive breast cancer. This is potentially, not only a first-in-class, but basin class, highly selective CDK4 inhibitor. And as you know, CDK6 leads to some of the vulnerabilities, including the bone marrow toxicity, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing on CDK4, which drive breast cancer proliferation. So we believe with the current date, including the safety and tolerability, the early clinical data support the potential for more complete and continuous dosing with CDK4. And as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve got no grade 4 neutropenia, no Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and no grade 4 and treatment-related AEs was observed. We\u2019ve aligned with the FDA on the first-line hormone receptor positive breast cancer study, which will start in the coming months. And it will be against physicians\u2019 choice of CDK4/6 in advance.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: I have one for Andrew on [indiscernible] of what I believe is this first call on the other side. In your first 4 months or so, can you help us better understand your findings regarding the portfolio? And more broadly, how do you hope to shape and focus the wide variety of assets that Pfizer has to drive sustainable growth?\nAlbert Bourla: So what -- now that you're in the dark side, what is your opinion, my friend?\nChris Boshoff: Well, I think, a, Evan, thanks for the question. B, I think in response to Albert\u2019s question, I think coming from finance, I guess, pharma is a segment of the light side rather than the dark side. But in terms of the question, look, I always regarded Pfizer\u2019s R&D engine, highly just because when you look at the stream of molecules that have been internally discovered at Pfizer over the years, first ALK inhibitor, first CDK4/6 inhibitor, numerous JAKs, ABRYSVO, there\u2019s clearly a very, very strong record of discovery and execution. And it\u2019s not just small molecules, I hasten to add. You see that in vaccines in oligos, in cell therapies, in bispecific. And for me, when I made the move, this was absolutely key in terms of a company that have this because if you don\u2019t have this, then life is very, very difficult. Now in answer to where I hope to add value coming forward, I think, as Albert alluded to earlier, historically, perhaps you may have pursued areas where that R&D investment hasn\u2019t translated into the type of revenues you want. The point is that this is a much easier challenge to solve. It\u2019s a matter of taking this incredibly powerful machine and put together in the right direction so that we are targeting those areas that translate into revenues. One thing that I think the COVID experience shows you is once Pfizer focuses, execution is something you should feel very comfortable about.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Courtney Breen with Bernstein.\nCourtney Breen: This is Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Perhaps building on the last question, looking at Slide 28 in the presentation today, it suggested that in the last 3 months, from the end of July to today, that there has been no meaningful advancement of the pipeline, albeit there are a number of pipeline actions kind of suggested to be initiating too. We are suggesting is as likely as a response to the reset and cost cutting that's going on. My first part to this question is, how will you ensure that this isn't repeated in further quarters? And how are we balancing the need to kind of take stock and cut while ensuring that high potential opportunities are getting appropriately accelerated through the pipeline?\nAlbert Bourla: Then maybe I will ask the 2 R&D heads to comment on that. Please, let's start with Chris.\nChris Boshoff: Yes. Thank you for the question. So just to remind us, this year, we've already started 8 new first in-patient studies in oncology, which I believe makes us the number 1 company in terms of Phase I clinical trial started. In the coming months, we expect potential Phase III readouts for breakwater, which is a very importation for us in BRAF mutated colorectal cancer which is up to 10% of colorectal cancer, and that will be in the first line setting, a big unmet need because there's particularly poor prognosis patients presenting with BRAF mutated colorectal cancer. We also expect readouts for Veritex2 our ER [indiscernible] we codeveloping with ovens for ER-positive second-line plus methodic breast cancer and potentially for Crest which is a sasanlimab, a differentiated subcut PD-1 in combination with BCP in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We will also present in the coming months, Phase II randomized data for [indiscernible]. This is a randomized Phase II data in patients with prostate cancer. We've seen the data, and that provided us the confidence to initiate the 2 Phase III programs. In the coming months, we'll also start additional Phase III studies, as I mentioned, CDK4 in first line [indiscernible] breast cancer [indiscernible] in combination with pembrolizumab in PD-L1 high first-line non-small cell lung cancer and CAT 6 with positive breast cancer.\nAlbert Bourla: So quite impressive on the Oncology side. Mikael, what about the rest?\nMikael Dolsten: We thought we help you focus by this quarter displaying some nice movement, most valuable part of this chart, the right-hand. When you look over the next 18 months and including Oncology and non-Oncology, we will have up to 40 different opportunities to fill the left side that I hear you are eager to see progress on and the right hand. If you\u2019ll include the 40 will be divided between potential approvals, projected pivotal readouts and potential proof of concept. And that did not even include early signals in clinical development.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Pfizer has previously stated, it anticipated having visibility on long-term COVID product sales based on 2024 trends. Since we are now nearing the end of 2024, I'm wondering what that long-term number is? And then secondly, does Pfizer have the Phase III booster data for the RS vaccine in adults in-house? And if yes, does the data show a similar step-down in Booster immunogenicity as did the GSK vaccine?\nAlbert Bourla: All right. So on the stability, let's -- maybe [indiscernible] you want to make a [indiscernible].\nChris Boshoff: Let me just comment on performance. I think, Steve, I think both on PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. I think what our performance to date as well as the quarter, which show us is that these are both entering into a category where we understand what the volumes are likely to be. And we believe these are going to be durable businesses going forward. So just as an example, on PAXLOVID, even if you take the onetime items that Dave alluded to aside for a moment, we've seen significant PAXLOVID treatment course utilization, right? Even just in the summer wave that happened over the course of the third quarter, we saw an average of about 100,000 courses of treatment at the start of July, growing to about 225,000 treatment courses in mid-August before that wave declined. And we've built a very durable commercial engine to support that with increasing treatment rates, with very viable reimbursement, both on the government side as well as on the commercial side and a way to activate HCPs and consumers who need our treatment. And similarly, on the vaccine, our goal this year with COMIRNATY, and we had the benefit of being able to start 3 weeks before last year, was to start the season with plenty of vaccine in fridges, both in the retail setting as well as in the health system setting. And again, we've demonstrated an ability to do that quite well. When you look at where vaccination is this year versus last year, it's a little bit higher, actually, but a big part of that is just a function of the calendar in the 3 weeks earlier. We expect to see vaccinations continue in October through December. And the shape of that curve will continue to evolve, but all of this makes us confident that we're seeing a durable business, both on vaccines and PAX.\nAlexandre de Germay: For international, this is Alexandre, thanks for the question, too. Same principles, we see enduring business. In COMIRNATY, just I want to remind everyone that in the International vision, we closed our third quarter at the end of August. So basically, you don't see any sales of COMIRNATY simply because most markets are starting of the vaccination campaign in September. Having said that, we are progressing very nicely in our key regions. So in Europe, we got the approval of the GEN-1 adapted vaccine in July, and we got the KP12 [indiscernible] September. So it's basically an [indiscernible] started to work with our health care authorities partner in Europe, where we have existing contract to implement the multiyear contract that is in place. Something in the U.K. and Canada, we've also worked with the authority to actually execute our contract. In Japan, we also got the GEN-1 adapted vaccine approved in mid-September. And COMIRNATY is actually the only PFS vaccine, never frozen, which could be a completed advantage considering the distribution model in Japan. So again, we see this as an enduring business and we see us as I said, executing our existing contracts in our key locations. So it's probably a -- PAXLOVID stands Q3 -- was a good Q3 for us, and it's actually very good because it satisfies of perception that actually is a sustainable business with sustainable demand, which coincides with the COVID wave. And we had quite a strong spring waves in Europe and Asia, and that translated into [indiscernible]. Just to close, I want to say that 47 countries outside of the U.S. have transitioned from advanced purchasing into commercial. So as we see in the U.S., it is an enduring and now the sales that we see quarter after quarter reflect the absolute demand and reflect the waves as they hit the different region of the world.\nAlbert Bourla: And still also, I can't resist also making some comments. In the 5.5 years of CEO, I had 23 earnings releases, of which 22 we beat EPS at Bloomberg and one we missed. And I don't like the one that we missed, and that was in Q3 last year and we missed it because of COVID. We severely miscalculate. Yes, there are excuses that last pandemic was 100 years ago. So we didn't have, let's say, benchmark. But -- and also, we had to reduce it significantly. We had $56 billion of COVID revenue in 2022 and we had a guidance of 22. So we reduced it at 40% on what used to be. However, life proved, that we got it wrong and us and everybody else. And the reality was that it was not 22 but 12. So we are very careful now when we speak about COVID because we don't want to miss it again. And -- but I would like to say that when I see the trends of the COVID business, PAXLOVID which for us is even more important because of the higher level of profitability, it is basically identical the utilization of last year compared to this year. So far, we had 4.9 million patients treated, end of Q3 with PAXLOVID in the U.S. and -- compared to 5.2 million people last year, the same period. The treatment rates have improved from 50% last year to 57%. And the fulfillment rates went a little bit down because now there is [indiscernible] from 88% went to 81%, but it's very, very stable. The same is with the COVID vaccination. When you see the trends of COVID vaccination, the utilization are basically the same like last year, more or less and still it's early in the season. So there could be fluctuations over there. But -- so I think your statement that some, we consider COVID as normal business now, it's absolutely true. And this is how we regard it. And we will stop separating our business to COVID and COVID because it's Pfizer business. And with that, I will ask Mikael to make a comment on the [indiscernible].\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you for your question. We have started to accumulate data on both durability and the impact of revaccination for RSV. On the majority of patients that we expected to go to pharmacy for revaccination, the titers remain robust after 1 and even 2 years, which is punctuate the quality of our oral vaccine. But they, of course, declined gradually, and we can have some meaningful improvement in this type with a booster. But I believe that likely in 3 years, around 3 years, we will see a drop in the titer that makes the boost really improve meaningfully, the protection for a substantial fraction of the patient. And that\u2019s what we are going to monitor now, whether the [indiscernible] is a good interval. But otherwise, it\u2019s performing exactly as expected for a high quality vaccine. Now there could be patient groups that go to physician offices that are more immunocompromised, moderate to severe patients, that may benefit from once a year, and that will be more a physician directive. So I hope that will give you a bit of an understanding how this will evolve.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.\nRajesh Kumar: My apologies. I was on mute. So two questions, if I may. What is the impact of [indiscernible] IRA on your business next year? Are there any numbers you're calling out, which might help us with the modeling? That would be very helpful to understand if there are any impacts. And the second one is, I appreciate the color on the Seagen pipeline and how you're progressing and how the market under appreciates the size of the opportunity? The sell-side estimates clearly did reflect your optimism. When is it that you'll feel a bit more confident or what do you need to see to increase your longer-term guidance on Seagen?\nAlbert Bourla: Dave, can you take the IRA [indiscernible].\nDave Denton: So I'll just hit on it very briefly. Obviously, the IRA and that [indiscernible] has pluses and pull -- pushes and pulls to us as we cycle into next year. When we provide guidance by the end of this year, we will give you a view on the net impact of that as we think about our business. So more to come, hold tight on that.\nAlbert Bourla: And there are puts and takes, so positive things are negative, right? So we need to assess it as we are building now these calculations as we are building our budgets for next year. Seagen pipeline, Chris?\nChris Boshoff: Yes. Thank you for the question. So I think last year, at this time, we didn\u2019t expect we\u2019re going to have PADCEV approved in first-line bladder and everyone forecast of that approval for the first half of this year. And obviously, the approval happened very early because of the unprecedented data. So I think the performance commercially is really as we expected or exceeded what we expected in 2024. If you look at the rest of the pipeline now, the new molecules like [indiscernible] D-L1B as well as next-generation CD30 ADC called 35C for cancer [indiscernible], we will present next year conferences more updated data on these, including in combination with pembrolizumab for [indiscernible] for DB and for PD-L1 as well as really highly encouraging data for 35C, the next-generation CD30. So I think by showing and releasing more data next year will help all of you to build confidence in the pipeline.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\nAkash Tewari: So looking at some of your IP around 25 [indiscernible] and Prevnar, it looks like you'll have a step up versus your previous 20 [indiscernible] vaccine, but it does look like effective serotype coverage could lag meaningfully versus Merck and backside approach it by 10% or more in older adults. How confident are you that the [indiscernible] vaccine could stave off a preferential rec from some of your peers down the line in adults? And then number two, can you talk about what special properties your once daily modified release enabledron could have outside of improved half-life that investors might be under-appreciating? I think those earlier comments stood out to us.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. The 25 [indiscernible] that you asked about, the fourth generation, we aspire to the one that first hits the pediatric market, which is where the bulk of use of doses. But we also think because of this unique improvement of serotype 3, that is far more important and several of the other tiny serotypes will bring an overall value to the other segment that will be very meaningful. And as you have heard, we are working on a fifth generation that will include both improved performance such as serotype 3 and go far beyond any of those serotypes that you are talking about in numbers. We used 30 plus just to keep a bit of details for the future. For the QD, I think in general, you saw, of course, with the injectable when you went from once a day to once a week and you\u2019ve got a smoother profile and reduced the number of peaks that many patients perform better on them. So that\u2019s hypothesis, we are keeping our eyes on that with a modified release, you will have a more smooth profile. You avoid certainly additional high peaks that immediately is halved, and that\u2019s something we have seen in other formulation of other drugs. And that\u2019s why I think we are trying to be attentive in order to have our eyes on details that can help to make this product a really nice oral product with some differentiation.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities.\nVamil Divan: I'll keep it to two. So one just on the guidance for the full year. You increased the total sales guidance by 3.5%. You increased the COVID products by $2 billion. So I guess, you're lowering the non-COVID by about $500 million. I guess some of that does not surprise us. I'm wondering if there's anything else you might call out where you're sort of trimming your expectations for the full year? And then second one, sort of tie to [indiscernible] news from a few weeks ago. We noticed the GVT601 of Savelator. So that seems to be progressing still in your pipeline. I'm just curious if you're contemplating or have you made any changes to that approach? And the mechanism is obviously similar [indiscernible], just wondering if anything you learned from the [indiscernible] situation. Should we should think about carrying over in [indiscernible].\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Vamil. Dave?\nDave Denton: Yes. On the guidance from a revenue perspective, you're absolutely correct. We increased our overall guidance by $1.5 billion. We increased PAXLOVID by 2, which implies that a $500 million compression in someplace else in the business, which is largely Oxbryta. We're absorbing the Oxbryta headwind and maintaining our 9% to 11% growth rate in our non-COVID business, which actually implies that our baseline business is actually performing quite well.\nAlbert Bourla: And I want to remind that the non-COVID business was 14% growth this quarter. Then Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, on [indiscernible], which was previously called 601, yes, I\u2019m encouraged about that opportunity. And of course, we try here to incorporate learnings, how \u2013 which price was developed to our advantage. As you know, that drive was already approved 2019 when we did acquisition a bit later and with several programs already up and running. 601 by itself is at a 10-fold lower dose, it has more potency and brings more improvement for hemolytic anemia as one example. So this part has performed very well in our Phase II and looked really nice in tolerability. So I [indiscernible] about that one. When I speak about higher learnings, Oxbryta was performed in the more recent studies in a part of the world where it\u2019s really difficult to do the type of high-quality, consistent to clinical trials. And as we investigating some of those learnings with Oxbryta, we have, as a countermeasure, focus [indiscernible] entirely on high-performance sites that have a history of delivering great drug development. And this will obviously also support a profile. So I\u2019m optimistic. And as there\u2019s final end here. Please remember that when we did a GPT deal, our eyes were really on [indiscernible] up to 80% of the value of the deal. But Oxbryta allowed early entrants into the market, and we\u2019ll continue to investigate Oxbryta and keep you updated, what we learned.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners.\nDave Risinger: And thanks for taking all these questions today. So my first question relates to cost cutting ahead. Obviously, the company has already engaged in significant SG&A and R&D efficiency initiatives. But I'm curious about whether management sees opportunities for further SG&A and R&D reductions? And then with respect to the over 30 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in preclinical development. Given management's prior statements about it's R&D initiatives, I'm assuming that, that will be adjuvanted and I just wanted to confirm that?\nAlbert Bourla: Let's take quickly, although that savings domain, the satin R&D. We did significant reductions and we were very careful to make them in a way that will not affect our pipeline and will not affect our business. So we are very happy with what has happened. Now are we going to not continue being efficient? Of course, we will. I think I see tremendous opportunities ahead of us that we can reduce some of the less ROI-driven investment that we are doing, both in R&D and SI&A. And part of that will be, of course, invested in more productive with a trend to be able to control the cost and absorb our cost inflation. So you should see a constant, very cost focused, very cost-conscious counsel as we move on. Now Mikael, on the 30 valent.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. Thank you for tying the question. And I think we really have been breaking new ground in our PCV technology platforms. And we\u2019re obviously very pleased to get some of our new technologies validated with the serotype 3 that you heard about in the [indiscernible] generation, the 25 [indiscernible]. The components that allows us to go far beyond 30 includes very sophisticated new type of chemistry that on certain hyper serotypes can give several fold improvement in titer. There are minor or more substantial formulation changes that can give some to quite significant fold increase and that may or may not include adjuvants and I also experienced that we\u2019re gaining on the use of carriers that we haven\u2019t been working on in PCV that can add to this tool book. So we are right now bringing all of these data together. And while we see we ran a lot with adjuvant as seen in our CDP program that allow us to go from 3 to 2, and we have a toolbox of new adjuvants, where it really will be necessary or not, it\u2019s too early to tell, but I acknowledge your good skills in the vaccine technology, and we keep you updated as we get closer to selecting candidates.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just two quick ones here. Just first on margin structure and following up on the prior question. Is a mid- to high 30% adjusted kind of operating margin -- adjusted for COMIRNATY are still fair for Pfizer? And what's the rough time line to get there? And then my second question was just on the vepdegestrant Max franchise. Obviously, a very strong year this year. But as [indiscernible] out to next year, we've got the Part D redesign, we've got incremental competition. Is there still enough volume opportunity here to think about this as a franchise that's going to be generating healthy growth? Or should we think about growth slowing significantly going forward?\nAlbert Bourla: [indiscernible] you start.\nDave Denton: So first, obviously, mid- to high 30s is very much within the realm of our business model. We're very focused against that. We continue to march and make progress against that over time. So we don't have a specific date for at this point in time. But as we continue to progress, both this year and we give guidance for next year, I'm sure you should see us completely progress on that front.\nAlbert Bourla: And I think COMIRNATY was also a little bit the question.\nDave Denton: Yes. Well, I think COMIRNATY obviously, is a down draft to that. So obviously, adjusted for the size of that business will be important. But having said that, we continue to make investments in our business such that we're more productive, top to bottom, therefore, expanding our operating margin profile of the company.\nAlbert Bourla: And we don't want to speak for specific products, the markets, right, because it's a little bit misleading. It depends on multiple things. We did it because of the extraordinary circumstances in '22. But in general, you all know that from 2 products, PAXLOVID is very, very high margin and COMIRNATY is on the low. [indiscernible], why don't we start international this time and then we end up with a mirror on [indiscernible] the redesign.\nChris Schott: Okay. So on the international, we had a very strong year, and we continue to grow very strongly this quarter at 31%. Actually, our total patients on [indiscernible] have increased by 14% in the third quarter versus the second quarter. So this is a straight [indiscernible] that we are growing, and we continue to add new patients on treatment. This is essentially the result of 3 things. One, the average of [indiscernible] as the standard of care pretty much in all the countries where we operate. Two, the establishment of a robust infrastructure of care, which can enable the faster diagnosis and treatment of this complex disease. So this is a complex disease, and finding those patients takes time. And now we have a [indiscernible]. And the third element is also, of course, the increased access. Today, we have 45 countries where we have reimbursements. And we just recently had in this quarter, 2 countries, the U.K. and Australia, so 2 significant countries, that have started to reimburse in that [indiscernible]. So moving forward, we really see that those 3 elements will continue to deliver and drive growth in the key international markets. And if you look at the treatment rates, in our major international market, we still see some potential to increase that diverse. So that will be the drivers of growth in the next flowing quarters.\nAlbert Bourla: I mean so Chris, in the U.S., I'll give you a little bit of color. Obviously, Vinda had very strong growth this year. And I think a big part of that has been just a direct result of the commercial effort and attention that we've put on it where we've seen real growth in the diagnosis rate and new patient starts. So new patient starts are up about 61% versus last year. And they're up about 3% quarter-over-quarter as well, and we're also improving compliance rates significantly with existing patients. For the market, there's a lot of patients, nearly half that remain diagnosed. So there's significant opportunity there. We will have tailwinds as we go forward. So we continue to put attention on this, and that's going to be largely increased diagnosis education, the prescriber rate that we're growing as well as affordability conditions and we've turned the page into 2025. But we do think that the volume growth will be at meaningfully lower levels than what we've seen year-to-date. And a big part of that is obviously headwinds we're going to see from the changing market landscape, where we will have new competitive entrants that will impact new patient starts as well as potential switching of existing patients onto some of these options. So those are some of the puts and takes on Vinda. IRA will be a piece of that as well as Dave mentioned, and we'll have more to share about '25 specifics when we give guidance.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: And first of all, congrats on a phenomenal hire in [indiscernible]. So maybe like taking the step back, can you comment something about ABRYSVO if there was any stocking this quarter? This particular market is a lot of like stocking driven in fourth and first quarter. So how you are thinking about that? It looks like from the IQVIA trends, price -- line price jumped a lot. So if you could help us understand what is going on there? And how should we think about this particular product in coming quarters?\nAlbert Bourla: Which product is Mohit? Unknown Executive ABRYSVO. [indiscernible]\nAlbert Bourla: So a few comments on ABRYSVO. So we wanted to, as I mentioned before, really start this vaccination season with ABRYSVO in fridges. And retailers, predominantly where volume is as well as with health systems. So we work with our customers and our channel partners to make sure that we were appropriately stocked and that's reflected in our Q3 numbers. Now what we have also seen over the course of Q3 is that administration volumes. And for ABRYSVO, that began in August, over the course of the quarter have continued to steadily rise. Now they are at lower volumes than from a market perspective, where they were last year. Lots of reasons for that, including timing of the COVID vaccines as well as the change in the ACE recommendation. But we anticipate that there will be volumes that continue into the fourth quarter. And finally, our results are also a function of what Albert mentioned is our significant improvement in market share. So we've doubled our market share into end customers from wholesalers and our market share of actual shots in arms of administrations in the retail setting in the middle of October was at 43%. So those are all the dynamics that are going into play for ABRYSVO performance in Q3 and heading into Q4.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Amir, and thank you, everyone, for your attention. It was another good quarter for Pfizer. I think we are continuing to execute the 5 points plan, but we have presented at the beginning of the year. There is an underlying operational health of our business, there is stabilization of the COVID business tool. Now we feel comfortable to [indiscernible] and we have seen strong growth from the remaining part of the business. We have seen strong performance from new products. Most of them, they have beaten analyst expectations this quarter, which shows that they are doing better at me than what was perceived they will do. And we are looking forward to continuing this path of executing and creating shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer and you have a wonderful.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our team continues to execute, and we are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance. We are guided by our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives. And I'm proud that we have reached more than 270 million patients with our medicines and vaccines through the first 9 months of 2024. The focus on execution excellence is starting to deliver results with market share gains in the U.S. and international as well as robust growth in revenues and EPS. As a result, we are raising guidance ranges and for our full year 2024 total revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share. In January, we presented the 5 key priorities that would guide Pfizer during our year of execution. Today, you will hear how we advanced our business in the third quarter with each of the strategic priorities. I will focus on highlights, showing our progress with the first 3. Dave will discuss our continued work to reduce our cost base, expand our margins and strategically deploy our capital. Then we will review our financial performance during the quarter and explain why we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term value for shareholders, and then we will take questions. So with that, I'll turn to our performance against our priorities during the quarter. Stated simply, Oncology is having a great year and delivered another quarter of strong performance, with 31% year-over-year performance growth resulting from solid demand across our product portfolio that includes legacy Seagen and legacy Pfizer products. We set a goal to achieve world-class Oncology leaders. In the U.S., we are already the third largest biopharma company in oncology by revenue through the first half of 2024, and we are proud of the progress we are making toward our goal. Demand continued to increase for XTANDI, the market leader for 4 types of advanced prostate cancer, grew 28% year-over-year. TALZENNA grew by 77% in the quarter versus the same quarter from a year ago. We are encouraged by the opportunity to further advance the prostate cancer treatment landscape based on the exciting overall survival data we announced earlier this month from the Phase III TALAPRO study. TALZENNA in combination with XTANDI demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer becoming the first and only such combination to do so. Driving scientific breakthroughs in -- cancer is one of the key areas of focus in Oncology. The TALAPRO-2 results show how we continue innovating to improve survival for men with prostate cancer, which is the second most common cancer in men and the fifth most common cause of cancer death among men worldwide. We saw continued momentum during the quarter with the ongoing launch of PADCEV with pembrolizumab for patients with advanced metastatic bladder cancer, regardless of their eligibility to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This combination has quickly become the most prescribed first-line treatment in the U.S. for locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer. In thoracic cancer, we achieved 31% operational growth this quarter with LORBRENA, a treatment for adult with alpositive metastatic noncell lung cancer. Following the release of our 5 years of CROWN data during the ASPA Neal meeting, we are observing an acceleration of first-line new patient starts around the world and in particular, in our key markets of the U.S., China, Germany and France. Our BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI combination also -- strong year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 32%, primarily driven by growth in the metastatic non-small cell cancer indications. And we continue to be pleased by strong performance with the launch of ELREXFIO, which had about 80% sequential revenue growth over the second quarter of 2024. In the U.S., we have more than doubled our new patient starts since January. In Japan, we were able to catch up with competition and launch as the first to market, BCMA bispecific, helping address an unmet medical need for patients with triple class exposed multiple myeloma. We believe ELREXFIO has the potential to be a transformative treatment option for people with multiple myeloma and we are continuing to advance development with 4 ongoing registrational studies in earlier lines of therapy, but if positive and approved, could support serving a way more expanded patient population. Now I will turn to some select highlights of our continued strategical advancing our pipeline. We are prioritizing opportunities where we have scientific leadership and deep capabilities to address significant unmet patient needs. Earlier, I spoke to the strength of our market Oncology medicines. Our pipeline, however, is what excites us the most. Lung cancer is the #1 cause of cancer-related death around the world. At the recent ESMO counts with our long-term follow-up results from FOREST trial, evaluating BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in patients with BRAF V600E mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, which demonstrated compelling efficacy for patients. We are also rapidly advancing to next-generation ADC candidates with the potential to make significant impact on the more than 300,000 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. The first is [indiscernible], which is now in Phase III, and we are planning additional -- trials in the coming months. The other one is a PD-L1 AV ADC. We are equally encouraged by the updated Phase I data we presented the ESMO for this ADC, and we are planning rotation enabling trials in 2025. Our [indiscernible] pipeline is expanding. We are studying another novel ADC, [indiscernible] in 2 ongoing registration intended trials in unfilial cancer. And MEBROMETOSTAN, our novel EZH2 inhibitor is another example of the progress we are making throughout our pipeline. This has been starting as a new potential treatment for men who have metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and we are enrolling currently patients into Phase III studies. Finally, to build on the foundation for our drugs, we are making progress with development of 2 candidates we believe can replace the current backbones of HER positive HER2 negative breast cancer. Atirmociclib, our potential first-in-class CDK4 inhibitor is enrolling a second line Phase III trial, and we expect to start a first line Phase III study by early 2025. And we expect the first Phase III data in the coming months for vepdegestrant, an Eastern receptor [indiscernible] that we are codeveloping right now with [indiscernible]. Our fourth generation PCB candidate now in Phase II adult and pediatrics, covers 25 serotypes, including improved immunogenicity for serotype 3, very important, which is one of the largest remaining contributors of disease. We are focused on building on our leadership in the industry by continuing to expand balance sheet with our fifth generation candidate, which is in preclinical development that covers over 30 serotype. In the last several months, we have advanced the potential new vaccine against Seba, which is considered and urgent public health threat that lacks any approved vaccines. Leveraging experience from our previous STEP program, we have developed a new formulation for a second-generation candidate. After encouraging Phase I data with this new formulation, we have advanced our Phase II study already. We are also working to support significant need for about 90 million Americans and 200 million Europeans in areas with high incidence of lime disease. VLA15 is a vaccine candidate we are codeveloping that is intended to protect against the 6 most prevalent serotypes in North America and Europe. A Phase III trial is underway, and pending positive data and regulatory approval, VLA15 would become the only vaccine available to help prevent the acute severe and long-term health consequences of lime disease global. TAXICOVID is the standard of care COMIRNATY in oral treatment for those at high risk of progressing to severe disease. We believe, however, that there is an opportunity to expand both our therapeutic impact and market position where our next-generation oral antiviral candidate, EBUSATRELVI. In a Phase II study, we have demonstrated a robust antiviral activity at all doses and without the need for returnable boosting. We have addressed the drug-drug interactions and the metallic taste associated with TAXICOVID. We expect to start a Phase III study in the coming months. We are also moving forward with our Phase III program in nonsegmental vitiligo with ritlecitinib, a candidate with a differentiated JAK mechanism developed in-house at Pfizer that has the potential to be an expansion of indications for [indiscernible], which is currently approved in severe alopecia areata. Vitiligo, like alopecia areata , an autoimmune disease with high unmet need. It is the leading cause for skin depigmentation and affects nearly 3 million patients in the U.S. alone. We are also enthusiastic about our 2 first-in-class trispecific antibodies with early data demonstrating excellent 3-in-1 potency. We believe this program has the potential to deliver improved efficacy in atopic dermatitis with an ongoing Phase II study evaluating safety and efficacy. We had a Phase II readout of ponsegromab, which is another in-house discovered and developed by us. We are encouraged by the potential for a breakthrough for patients with cancer cachexia, who lack treatment options for this life whitening wasting condition that currently has no FDA-approved treatments. The Phase II study met its primary endpoints change from baseline in body weight compared to placebo across all dose tests. And the highest dose of [indiscernible], sought improvements for baseline in appetite, cachexia symptoms, physical activity and muscle mass. Based on these positive results, we expect to advance to a registration-enabling study next year. Our Phase II study in patients with heart failure related cachexia is ongoing. We remain on track with our dose optimization studies for danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist candidate and look forward to discussing more about this in early 2025. In our broader obesity portfolio, we continue to advance our early-stage candidates, including our oral small module GIPR antagonist, which is advancing to Phase II in 2024 this year. And in additional, all once daily oral GLP-1 receptor agonist in Phase I. The highlights, I mentioned today across important therapeutic areas show how we have made meaningful advancements with our pipeline. As we announced earlier this year, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's Chief Scientific Officer, will depart from Pfizer after 15 years of leading Pfizer's research efforts. Our progress for selecting a successor is not quite advanced, and we look forward to announcing an update soon. Now I will turn to our commercial performance. And another one of our strategic priorities is maximizing the performance of our new products. I'm pleased that the decisive actions we took to enhance our commercial organization at the beginning of the year are giving satisfactory results. With NURTEC, we saw 28% total prescription growth and continued leadership in the oral [indiscernible] class. Importantly, 85% of primary care clinicians writing CGRP prescriptions first time [indiscernible] NURTEC, 85%. This shows the progress we are making in primary care as well as our work with payers to remove barriers for timely patient access to treatment. Among our vaccines, we are very pleased with our performance since the launch of Prevnar20, which has already achieved 83% market in pediatric and 97% in adults. With last week's recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to expand adult pneumococcal vaccination to include all adults age 50 and older, we believe Prevnar20 is well positioned to serve and expand the population in the United States. Outside of the U.S., we are predominantly serving the pediatric market. And following the recent first quarter approval in Japan and EU, we are gaining vaccine technical committee recommendations and several market in programs. With ABRYSVO, we continued improving our U.S. market acquisition with strong commercial execution. Our market share of sales, retailers and clinics out of wholesalers has exceeded 50% for the quarter. And our market set of shots in arms in the [indiscernible] setting has increased for 9 consecutive weeks through mid-October, currently reaching 43%. Last week's FDA approval for ABRYSVO for patients 18 through 59 who are at increased risk of low respirable drug disease caused by RSV, could help a serve and expand the population over time. With the rise in COVID-19 infection in the summer and early fall, we have responded to increased demand for PAXLOVID as we launched in the U.S. commercial market at the beginning of the year. Our better-than-expected growth during the quarter for PAXLOVID reflects higher inflection rates and the strong commercial execution of our team. Our ability to execute effectively includes improving patient actions, raising awareness of this treatment option, expanding use of alternative sites of care and also continuing to educate health care providers. The demand for PAXLOVID have stabilized. In the slide, you can see the total number of patients treated with PAXLOVID in '24, which is very similar to the same period in '23. It appears to be closely correlated with its weight of COVID-19, but also appear to have very similar pattern in '23 and '24. The 63% operational growth in the third quarter of our VYNDAQEL family of products is a direct result of our progress in expanding the health care provider base and supporting clinicians in identifying more patients who can benefit from this therapy, as well as our work to improve patient access and adherence to therapy. Internationally, VYNDAQEL is reimbursed in 44 markets right now and more affected next year. While that integrates value across markets, the unmet [indiscernible] remains significant as restated by the 10% increase of patients on treatment in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2024 in the U.S. We were pleased by the 74% quarterly operational growth and continued progress with expanding access with CIBINQO, a treatment for patients 12 and up with moderate to severe eczema who didn't respond to other treatments and 27% growth in the U.S. on the second to third quarters of 2024. With Litfulo, the first and only FDA-approved prescription pill for both adults and adolescents as young as 12 with severe alopecia areata. Now, and I will turn it over to Dave. Thanks, Dave. It's time for the Q&A. But before we take our first question, I want to briefly address the topic that I know is in the minds of many. We seek to be attentive to our shareholders and are always open to hearing their perspective. We had a meeting with Starboard Value 2 weeks ago. I was there with our Lead Director and our Head of Investor Relations. The meeting was constructive and [indiscernible]. They presented the same deck they made public last week. And given the proximity to our quarterly earnings day, we were mainly in listening mode. While we agree with some of the points they raised, we have vastly different views on many others. For example, they expressed dissatisfaction with our total shareholder return. We are not satisfied either, though we believe we are executing on the best path forward to increase shareholder return. On the other hand, they challenged our capital deployment for business development. We believe that our deals will produce significant shareholder returns, and some of them like Seagen or BioNTech have been transformational for Pfizer. The important thing is what we do to improve performance. In January, we presented a 5-point [indiscernible] aiming to create shareholder value that has guided our decision-making all year long. We remain focused on executing this plan and on delivering for our commitments, including driving long-term shareholder value. We will engage productively with our shareholders, including Starboard, and will consider all good ideas that are offering. And with that, operator, please assemble the queue to discuss our third quarter performance and pipeline. Look, I will ask Mikael to comment because there is a lot of activities going on right now, all that. But my general comment is that, as I have said, if Daniel moves fast based on what we know right now, we should be the second oral into the market, provided that the first one will be successful and the other ones will not come before us. But so far, this is what the situation looks like. The market is very, very large. And there is a significant need for oral solutions. We know that. So there is no doubt that if successful, we will have our decent market share of oral. But the important thing it is that obesity market is developing, let's say, nicely also in terms of science, and we are exploring several other opportunities right now. The two that we have mentioned in the clinic, Mikael Michael can speak a little bit more, both about the danu and the other two, Mikael. Let's start with Mikael a little bit on the science, and then maybe Andrew can speak about the potential market size of the [indiscernible]. Yes, correct. And building on Mikael's comments, look, Extia is a massive unmet medical need. It's 50% to 80% of patients with oncology, suffer from that, particularly, as you know, within pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. It's probably about 20% to 30% in heart failure and COPD. The size of the market really depends on whether it's viewed as a supportive care therapy. But also, obviously, as Mikael mentioned, whether you have outcome benefit. And obviously, depending on the outcome of those trials, we're going to be looking at different price points. So the size of the market or particularly the size of this drug is going to be very much informed by the data that we deliver in the pending Phase II and Phase III trials. Mikael? Why don't we start with this one and then I'll take a little bit the activist question. As regards the \u2013 our projections compared to the Street projections in the business development. First of all, let's start by saying that by far, the 2 biggest Seagen and BioNTech in terms of revenues, right? And in both as, I think the Street move on seem way up compared to when we made the deal. And upon the [indiscernible] we are very, very stable. The other ones that also \u2013if you add to that, the Biohaven with NURTEC, which we are on our plans and we just exceeded for the second quarter, Street expectations, it is covering 80% of the investments that we have made and probably weigh more in terms of revenues. And the most important thing is that those Seagen, for example, or the BioNTech with our development of mRNA infrastructure around the world. And the Seagen acquisition with our taking over the ADC technology of [indiscernible] was a unique, unique asset is transformational for Pfizer. It's not the revenue growth, but we are seeing right now, and we'll continue seeing all the way towards the end of the decade. But it is 2 \u2013 a disease, one already in Phase III, the other is about to start Phase III that we got from Seagen, one the SV and the other, the PDL-1 ADC. Those are mega-blockbusters, if there are technical success, mega-blockbusters. And we are moving to Phase III because we have seen very positive earlier data. The same issue. We're starting with [indiscernible] cancer, another ADC. So I would say that I think \u2013 we truly think that this was well invested capital and will demonstrate significant value for shareholder. But I want also to make a final comment for any discussion with activists. But no matter if we are agree or disagree on what has happened, I think the most important thing, it is what we are doing going forward. Starboard has not presented any specific actions, but they suggested something needs to change. From that point, in the beginning of the year, already a year ago, we are already starting changing a lot of things. Over the past 10 months, we have implemented changes like we changed our commercial model to separate the U.S. and international business and appointed new leaders who have now delivered 3 consecutive quarters of revenue. And we integrated Seagen and created an end-to-end oncology research organization to ensure a successful integration of the company \u2013 of the Seagen pipeline. And we have retained the vast majority of the legacy Seagen colleagues, and we have delivered multiple, multiple successful readouts from that. We announced a plan to reduce OpEx by $4 billion, which we are executing successfully without negatively affecting the top line. We announced an additional plan to reduce manufacturing costs by $1.5 billion, which so far is delivering satisfactory results. We brought in Andrew Baum, which is a knowledgeable research analyst to help prioritize our R&D pipeline and future business development. We are advancing now the process of selecting a new scientific officer. And we have enhanced our Board with 2 terrific new directors who have deep expertise in corporate governance and shareholder value creation. So what we believe is that all these changes are the result of an intentional 5-point plan that we rolled out already in January of last year. So as I said in my personal, let's say, remarks, we plan to engage with shareholders, including Starboard and consider any good ideas that create long-term shareholder value. But I don't think that the statement something needs to change is really pragmatic because it's coming 15 months late. Okay. Dave, let's start with the first question. Chris, can you give us an update on the Seagen integration, both speak a little bit about the commercial, but also focus on the research, which is a significant value? Mikael? Thank you, Mikael. Now on [indiscernible] IRA. Clearly, IRA overall is negative for innovation and does not promote a spirit that people could provide investments, but there are also some good things about it. So clearly, I wouldn't like to see that the out-of-pocket that next year will be $167 per month for all your medicines for seniors. That, we want to be maintained. But this forced price setting [indiscernible] negotiation and also the penalty deal between \u2013 are things that needs to change. And it's not only on IRA. I would mention that 340B right now, it is one of the biggest issue, and it is unethical and it is the way that it is evolving. And it is creating significant transfer of funds from where it needs to be the [indiscernible] people to booster the profit lines of some business. So 340B reform is something that myself and the entire pharma is setting as a priority. So thank you for your question. All right. I mean, would you like to speak a little bit about the RSV and the maybe Terence, to directly answer your question. So how the market evolves, it's going to be a function of how ACIP recommendations for RSV evolve, and that includes revaccination timing, as you mentioned, but also [indiscernible] populations. I don't think it's really productive for us to predict how ACIP is going to evolve these recommendations. But we do feel confident in the Bristow's profile. And importantly, what I would like to highlight is we feel very confident in our ability to pull that profile through. You heard Albert describe our momentum in the U.S. market, particularly in light of dramatic improvements in our market share versus last year. And we continue to be ready to advance in vaccinations in the fourth quarter as well. And the last thing I would say is the FDA's recent approval of the 18- to 59-year-old at-risk population makes ABRYSVO the only RSV vaccine that's indicated to protect patients as young as 18 years of age, and it further strengthens this active on the viability of ABRYSVO. Last thing I'll say is on maternal. We have also had really good momentum on our ABRYSVO maternal indication. We see very strong signals in uptake for the month of September. We had a 20% uptake, which is a full doubling of where we ended the last season. And we continue to see uptake amongst OB/GYNs and health systems. So in the first 4 weeks of this season, the units that we shipped into those systems were up 56% from the first 4 weeks of last season. So we see momentum on ABRYSVO, and we look forward to future [indiscernible] updates. And Alexandre, do you want to add something on the international because that's also an important market for us. . And then why don't we go to Chris for the question on the design of the Phase III. So what -- now that you're in the dark side, what is your opinion, my friend? Then maybe I will ask the 2 R&D heads to comment on that. Please, let's start with Chris. So quite impressive on the Oncology side. Mikael, what about the rest? All right. So on the stability, let's -- maybe [indiscernible] you want to make a [indiscernible]. And still also, I can't resist also making some comments. In the 5.5 years of CEO, I had 23 earnings releases, of which 22 we beat EPS at Bloomberg and one we missed. And I don't like the one that we missed, and that was in Q3 last year and we missed it because of COVID. We severely miscalculate. Yes, there are excuses that last pandemic was 100 years ago. So we didn't have, let's say, benchmark. But -- and also, we had to reduce it significantly. We had $56 billion of COVID revenue in 2022 and we had a guidance of 22. So we reduced it at 40% on what used to be. However, life proved, that we got it wrong and us and everybody else. And the reality was that it was not 22 but 12. So we are very careful now when we speak about COVID because we don't want to miss it again. And -- but I would like to say that when I see the trends of the COVID business, PAXLOVID which for us is even more important because of the higher level of profitability, it is basically identical the utilization of last year compared to this year. So far, we had 4.9 million patients treated, end of Q3 with PAXLOVID in the U.S. and -- compared to 5.2 million people last year, the same period. The treatment rates have improved from 50% last year to 57%. And the fulfillment rates went a little bit down because now there is [indiscernible] from 88% went to 81%, but it's very, very stable. The same is with the COVID vaccination. When you see the trends of COVID vaccination, the utilization are basically the same like last year, more or less and still it's early in the season. So there could be fluctuations over there. But -- so I think your statement that some, we consider COVID as normal business now, it's absolutely true. And this is how we regard it. And we will stop separating our business to COVID and COVID because it's Pfizer business. And with that, I will ask Mikael to make a comment on the [indiscernible]. Dave, can you take the IRA [indiscernible]. And there are puts and takes, so positive things are negative, right? So we need to assess it as we are building now these calculations as we are building our budgets for next year. Seagen pipeline, Chris? Mikael? Thank you, Vamil. Dave? And I want to remind that the non-COVID business was 14% growth this quarter. Then Mikael? Let's take quickly, although that savings domain, the satin R&D. We did significant reductions and we were very careful to make them in a way that will not affect our pipeline and will not affect our business. So we are very happy with what has happened. Now are we going to not continue being efficient? Of course, we will. I think I see tremendous opportunities ahead of us that we can reduce some of the less ROI-driven investment that we are doing, both in R&D and SI&A. And part of that will be, of course, invested in more productive with a trend to be able to control the cost and absorb our cost inflation. So you should see a constant, very cost focused, very cost-conscious counsel as we move on. Now Mikael, on the 30 valent. [indiscernible] you start. And I think COMIRNATY was also a little bit the question. And we don't want to speak for specific products, the markets, right, because it's a little bit misleading. It depends on multiple things. We did it because of the extraordinary circumstances in '22. But in general, you all know that from 2 products, PAXLOVID is very, very high margin and COMIRNATY is on the low. [indiscernible], why don't we start international this time and then we end up with a mirror on [indiscernible] the redesign. I mean so Chris, in the U.S., I'll give you a little bit of color. Obviously, Vinda had very strong growth this year. And I think a big part of that has been just a direct result of the commercial effort and attention that we've put on it where we've seen real growth in the diagnosis rate and new patient starts. So new patient starts are up about 61% versus last year. And they're up about 3% quarter-over-quarter as well, and we're also improving compliance rates significantly with existing patients. For the market, there's a lot of patients, nearly half that remain diagnosed. So there's significant opportunity there. We will have tailwinds as we go forward. So we continue to put attention on this, and that's going to be largely increased diagnosis education, the prescriber rate that we're growing as well as affordability conditions and we've turned the page into 2025. But we do think that the volume growth will be at meaningfully lower levels than what we've seen year-to-date. And a big part of that is obviously headwinds we're going to see from the changing market landscape, where we will have new competitive entrants that will impact new patient starts as well as potential switching of existing patients onto some of these options. So those are some of the puts and takes on Vinda. IRA will be a piece of that as well as Dave mentioned, and we'll have more to share about '25 specifics when we give guidance. Which product is Mohit? Unknown Executive ABRYSVO. [indiscernible] So a few comments on ABRYSVO. So we wanted to, as I mentioned before, really start this vaccination season with ABRYSVO in fridges. And retailers, predominantly where volume is as well as with health systems. So we work with our customers and our channel partners to make sure that we were appropriately stocked and that's reflected in our Q3 numbers. Now what we have also seen over the course of Q3 is that administration volumes. And for ABRYSVO, that began in August, over the course of the quarter have continued to steadily rise. Now they are at lower volumes than from a market perspective, where they were last year. Lots of reasons for that, including timing of the COVID vaccines as well as the change in the ACE recommendation. But we anticipate that there will be volumes that continue into the fourth quarter. And finally, our results are also a function of what Albert mentioned is our significant improvement in market share. So we've doubled our market share into end customers from wholesalers and our market share of actual shots in arms of administrations in the retail setting in the middle of October was at 43%. So those are all the dynamics that are going into play for ABRYSVO performance in Q3 and heading into Q4. Thank you, Amir, and thank you, everyone, for your attention. It was another good quarter for Pfizer. I think we are continuing to execute the 5 points plan, but we have presented at the beginning of the year. There is an underlying operational health of our business, there is stabilization of the COVID business tool. Now we feel comfortable to [indiscernible] and we have seen strong growth from the remaining part of the business. We have seen strong performance from new products. Most of them, they have beaten analyst expectations this quarter, which shows that they are doing better at me than what was perceived they will do. And we are looking forward to continuing this path of executing and creating shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer and you have a wonderful."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mikael Dolsten",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert. Yes, as you heard in Albert's remarks before the meeting, we continue to execute on our danuglipron plan, which includes a once-a-day profile with a modified release type of system. And we do believe that once a day with modified release could have some really special features and bringing that as a second oral would help really to have a strong foot into that market, in the same way, we have seen injectable being split etweenn 2 different products. I don't expect that the various oral will, in the end, differ that much in the GLP-1 class. So that's why we were keen also to move a GIFR, which could add better tolerability and more efficacy. And we're right now, initiating Phase II studies on the backbone of [indiscernible] engines. And these are our 2 more advanced bets, plus we always like to bring in this huge segment in drives and have more options as we advance. And you've heard there are so many applications for GLP-1s, and that's why we have a second once-a-day again. I think in general, for cancer agents, and this is more in the supported care, we're addressing segments of unmet patient needs, which relates to be able to regain the performance status with better body weight, have higher physical activity and be able to go through more treatment cycles, which should often translate to better long-term survival. As you know, that is always dependent on how patients cross over to different trials. So I do think initial registration will come from similar endpoint as in our Phase II studies, but we clearly aim to translate better patient performance to other outcomes that are more harder endpoint going through more treatment cycle and treatment that, call it, with better cancer outcome over time. And this is -- will be shown in multiple cancer types. So we do think similar to other product that earlier have been heavily used in support of cancer care, this could be a very large opportunity. And in addition to that, we are running a heart failure studies and looking at a third opportunity, also large chronic disease. And with that, Andrew, some comments on the potential of this molecule? Yes. I think the ability of GIPR to act in concert with GLP-1 has been well documented in a few different peptide settings. So we aim to be the first to document this with an oral approach, and that could offer a really nice differentiation for patients that need more and faster achieving of the treatment objectives. That's what we want to reveal right now. On the -- our new platform for PCV generation 4 and 5, we include a number of technical improvements. We don't want to disclose those today, but we did -- we're open to mention that our PCV fourth generation, which covers 25 serotypes have as an example and improved serotype 3 based on new technology that moves it far beyond what we believe any other technology has been able to accomplish. And why is that important? Well, serotype 3 covers somewhere between 15% to 30% of disease in different countries and improving on that can have a bigger impact than adding a number of rather infrequent serotypes. As we go to the more than 30 valent, it will be a combination of such improvement and many more serotypes. For orals, to keep it very [indiscernible], I think you have a number of things that could be advantageous. One is, of course, the combined [indiscernible] with all other drugs that are involved in [indiscernible] metabolic disease to give long outcomes. And what you're looking for I would say is 10% to 20% order weight, the lower range of the first GLP. The upper range is where you can see oral combinations edge towards. And that's very much similar to what you can see with the peptide. So I can very broad with a lower and an aspirational range, the lower for more single agents that will edge above that and combi agents that can aspire to go above 15 and edge above that. We thought we help you focus by this quarter displaying some nice movement, most valuable part of this chart, the right-hand. When you look over the next 18 months and including Oncology and non-Oncology, we will have up to 40 different opportunities to fill the left side that I hear you are eager to see progress on and the right hand. If you'll include the 40 will be divided between potential approvals, projected pivotal readouts and potential proof of concept. And that did not even include early signals in clinical development. Yes. Thank you for your question. We have started to accumulate data on both durability and the impact of revaccination for RSV. On the majority of patients that we expected to go to pharmacy for revaccination, the titers remain robust after 1 and even 2 years, which is punctuate the quality of our oral vaccine. But they, of course, declined gradually, and we can have some meaningful improvement in this type with a booster. But I believe that likely in 3 years, around 3 years, we will see a drop in the titer that makes the boost really improve meaningfully, the protection for a substantial fraction of the patient. And that's what we are going to monitor now, whether the [indiscernible] is a good interval. But otherwise, it's performing exactly as expected for a high quality vaccine. Now there could be patient groups that go to physician offices that are more immunocompromised, moderate to severe patients, that may benefit from once a year, and that will be more a physician directive. So I hope that will give you a bit of an understanding how this will evolve. Yes. The 25 [indiscernible] that you asked about, the fourth generation, we aspire to the one that first hits the pediatric market, which is where the bulk of use of doses. But we also think because of this unique improvement of serotype 3, that is far more important and several of the other tiny serotypes will bring an overall value to the other segment that will be very meaningful. And as you have heard, we are working on a fifth generation that will include both improved performance such as serotype 3 and go far beyond any of those serotypes that you are talking about in numbers. We used 30 plus just to keep a bit of details for the future. For the QD, I think in general, you saw, of course, with the injectable when you went from once a day to once a week and you've got a smoother profile and reduced the number of peaks that many patients perform better on them. So that's hypothesis, we are keeping our eyes on that with a modified release, you will have a more smooth profile. You avoid certainly additional high peaks that immediately is halved, and that's something we have seen in other formulation of other drugs. And that's why I think we are trying to be attentive in order to have our eyes on details that can help to make this product a really nice oral product with some differentiation. Yes, on [indiscernible], which was previously called 601, yes, I'm encouraged about that opportunity. And of course, we try here to incorporate learnings, how \u2013 which price was developed to our advantage. As you know, that drive was already approved 2019 when we did acquisition a bit later and with several programs already up and running. 601 by itself is at a 10-fold lower dose, it has more potency and brings more improvement for hemolytic anemia as one example. So this part has performed very well in our Phase II and looked really nice in tolerability. So I [indiscernible] about that one. When I speak about higher learnings, Oxbryta was performed in the more recent studies in a part of the world where it's really difficult to do the type of high-quality, consistent to clinical trials. And as we investigating some of those learnings with Oxbryta, we have, as a countermeasure, focus [indiscernible] entirely on high-performance sites that have a history of delivering great drug development. And this will obviously also support a profile. So I'm optimistic. And as there's final end here. Please remember that when we did a GPT deal, our eyes were really on [indiscernible] up to 80% of the value of the deal. But Oxbryta allowed early entrants into the market, and we'll continue to investigate Oxbryta and keep you updated, what we learned. Yes. Thank you for tying the question. And I think we really have been breaking new ground in our PCV technology platforms. And we're obviously very pleased to get some of our new technologies validated with the serotype 3 that you heard about in the [indiscernible] generation, the 25 [indiscernible]. The components that allows us to go far beyond 30 includes very sophisticated new type of chemistry that on certain hyper serotypes can give several fold improvement in titer. There are minor or more substantial formulation changes that can give some to quite significant fold increase and that may or may not include adjuvants and I also experienced that we're gaining on the use of carriers that we haven't been working on in PCV that can add to this tool book. So we are right now bringing all of these data together. And while we see we ran a lot with adjuvant as seen in our CDP program that allow us to go from 3 to 2, and we have a toolbox of new adjuvants, where it really will be necessary or not, it's too early to tell, but I acknowledge your good skills in the vaccine technology, and we keep you updated as we get closer to selecting candidates."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Chris Boshoff",
            "content": "Thank you very much for the question. Overall, we're very pleased with the integration to date. We've retained the vast majority of colleagues at legacy Seagen, and we now have over 1,500 colleagues working in our facilities in Basel just outside Seattle. As you saw the global revenue in Q3, we printed $854 million from legacy Seagen and of that, PADCEV printed over $400 million in Q3. Seagen year-to-date delivered for us $2.3 billion, which is 38% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We continue to execute very well on the portfolio, on the pipeline. We started Phase III studies with dasitamab vedotin in urothelial cancer, that's HER2-low, which is up to 40% of bladder cancer. With Sigotatacvedotin, the differentiated B6A started the first Phase III study in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, that's where we saw most significant data. And we're also planning to start the combination of sicotatactedotin pembrolizumab in the first-line setting of non-small cell lung cans and recently discussed and aligned with the FDA on trial design and on the dosing. We're also progressing and to start a Phase III program with the PD-L1 V, the [indiscernible] in combination with pembrolizumab early next year. So overall, great commercial performance so far. We haven't missed a beat, and we continue to execute on the pipeline. Thank you very much for the question. On atormocyclib, our highly selective CDK4 inhibitor. This was another small molecule that was conceptualized and discovered in our laboratories in La Jolla. And as you know, it's currently in a Phase III program for second line plus hormone receptor positive breast cancer. This is potentially, not only a first-in-class, but basin class, highly selective CDK4 inhibitor. And as you know, CDK6 leads to some of the vulnerabilities, including the bone marrow toxicity, and that's why we're focusing on CDK4, which drive breast cancer proliferation. So we believe with the current date, including the safety and tolerability, the early clinical data support the potential for more complete and continuous dosing with CDK4. And as you've seen, we've got no grade 4 neutropenia, no Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and no grade 4 and treatment-related AEs was observed. We've aligned with the FDA on the first-line hormone receptor positive breast cancer study, which will start in the coming months. And it will be against physicians' choice of CDK4/6 in advance. Well, I think, a, Evan, thanks for the question. B, I think in response to Albert's question, I think coming from finance, I guess, pharma is a segment of the light side rather than the dark side. But in terms of the question, look, I always regarded Pfizer's R&D engine, highly just because when you look at the stream of molecules that have been internally discovered at Pfizer over the years, first ALK inhibitor, first CDK4/6 inhibitor, numerous JAKs, ABRYSVO, there's clearly a very, very strong record of discovery and execution. And it's not just small molecules, I hasten to add. You see that in vaccines in oligos, in cell therapies, in bispecific. And for me, when I made the move, this was absolutely key in terms of a company that have this because if you don't have this, then life is very, very difficult. Now in answer to where I hope to add value coming forward, I think, as Albert alluded to earlier, historically, perhaps you may have pursued areas where that R&D investment hasn't translated into the type of revenues you want. The point is that this is a much easier challenge to solve. It's a matter of taking this incredibly powerful machine and put together in the right direction so that we are targeting those areas that translate into revenues. One thing that I think the COVID experience shows you is once Pfizer focuses, execution is something you should feel very comfortable about. Yes. Thank you for the question. So just to remind us, this year, we've already started 8 new first in-patient studies in oncology, which I believe makes us the number 1 company in terms of Phase I clinical trial started. In the coming months, we expect potential Phase III readouts for breakwater, which is a very importation for us in BRAF mutated colorectal cancer which is up to 10% of colorectal cancer, and that will be in the first line setting, a big unmet need because there's particularly poor prognosis patients presenting with BRAF mutated colorectal cancer. We also expect readouts for Veritex2 our ER [indiscernible] we codeveloping with ovens for ER-positive second-line plus methodic breast cancer and potentially for Crest which is a sasanlimab, a differentiated subcut PD-1 in combination with BCP in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We will also present in the coming months, Phase II randomized data for [indiscernible]. This is a randomized Phase II data in patients with prostate cancer. We've seen the data, and that provided us the confidence to initiate the 2 Phase III programs. In the coming months, we'll also start additional Phase III studies, as I mentioned, CDK4 in first line [indiscernible] breast cancer [indiscernible] in combination with pembrolizumab in PD-L1 high first-line non-small cell lung cancer and CAT 6 with positive breast cancer. Let me just comment on performance. I think, Steve, I think both on PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. I think what our performance to date as well as the quarter, which show us is that these are both entering into a category where we understand what the volumes are likely to be. And we believe these are going to be durable businesses going forward. So just as an example, on PAXLOVID, even if you take the onetime items that Dave alluded to aside for a moment, we've seen significant PAXLOVID treatment course utilization, right? Even just in the summer wave that happened over the course of the third quarter, we saw an average of about 100,000 courses of treatment at the start of July, growing to about 225,000 treatment courses in mid-August before that wave declined. And we've built a very durable commercial engine to support that with increasing treatment rates, with very viable reimbursement, both on the government side as well as on the commercial side and a way to activate HCPs and consumers who need our treatment. And similarly, on the vaccine, our goal this year with COMIRNATY, and we had the benefit of being able to start 3 weeks before last year, was to start the season with plenty of vaccine in fridges, both in the retail setting as well as in the health system setting. And again, we've demonstrated an ability to do that quite well. When you look at where vaccination is this year versus last year, it's a little bit higher, actually, but a big part of that is just a function of the calendar in the 3 weeks earlier. We expect to see vaccinations continue in October through December. And the shape of that curve will continue to evolve, but all of this makes us confident that we're seeing a durable business, both on vaccines and PAX. Yes. Thank you for the question. So I think last year, at this time, we didn't expect we're going to have PADCEV approved in first-line bladder and everyone forecast of that approval for the first half of this year. And obviously, the approval happened very early because of the unprecedented data. So I think the performance commercially is really as we expected or exceeded what we expected in 2024. If you look at the rest of the pipeline now, the new molecules like [indiscernible] D-L1B as well as next-generation CD30 ADC called 35C for cancer [indiscernible], we will present next year conferences more updated data on these, including in combination with pembrolizumab for [indiscernible] for DB and for PD-L1 as well as really highly encouraging data for 35C, the next-generation CD30. So I think by showing and releasing more data next year will help all of you to build confidence in the pipeline."

            "name": "Dave Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I will build on Albert's comments by reinforcing that we are very pleased with the financial results for the third quarter of 2024. These results demonstrate that our focus and our execution against our 5 strategic priorities are driving positive patient outcomes and continued financial and operational strength. In addition to our strong top line performance, our cost reduction programs are creating a more efficient organization, setting the stage for increased capital returns and supporting our commitment to both maintaining and growing our dividend, all while enhancing shareholder value. This morning, I will briefly review our Q3 P&L performance, I'll highlight our capital allocation priorities and touch upon our full year 2024 financial guidance. Additionally, as we approach the end of the year, I will also share several modeling considerations as we began to plan for 2025. Turning first to the third quarter performance versus the same period of last year. Let me walk on the P&L. Total company revenues were $17.7 billion, representing an impressive 32% operational growth. Our COVID-19 products were significant contributors with PAXLOVID generating $2.7 billion in revenue. This included $442 million related to delivering 1 million treatment courses to the U.S. Government Strategic National Stockpile. COMIRNATY, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed $1.4 billion in revenue. Our COVID-19 products were not the only drivers during the quarter. Our non-COVID products also exhibited robust performance with revenues of $13.6 billion, reflecting 14% operational year-over-year growth. This performance shows that our refined commercial approach is working. We continue to focus on key products and geographies, we've refined how we allocate our commercial field resources globally and we're further optimizing our marketing resources into key priority areas. We saw strong contribution from our recently acquired Seagen products, including Passive, which continues its momentum following the results of the EV302 study last year. Other key growth drivers included VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS, XTANDI and NURTEC, partially offset by declines in Xeljanz and Ibrance. Adjusted gross margin for the third quarter is approximately 70%, primarily the result of a net unfavorable mix related to our COVID-19 products, primarily due to the COMIRNATY profit split with BioNTech and applicable royalty expenses, as well as a slight dampening due to the associated costs incurred with the withdrawal of Oxbryta. All of this was partially offset by our ongoing focus on cost management across our manufacturing network. We continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s for the full year. And as previously communicated, long-term improvements in gross margins will remain a key focus for the company over the next several years. We expect to achieve savings from Phase I of our manufacturing optimization program beginning in 2025 and deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings for the first phase by the end of 2027. In parallel, we continue to evaluate our strategy for both Phase II and Phase III, which will focus on network structure and product portfolio, respectively. And we expect to have more information to share on those components of the program once they become available. Total adjusted operating expenses decreased 2% operationally to $5.8 billion. And I will note that this amount includes spending acquired via our Seagen transaction. And looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally, driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched and acquired products partly offset by a reduction in the U.S. health care reform fees. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 4% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending on certain vaccine programs as well as our cost realignment program, partially offset by an increased spending related to the Seagen acquisition. We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management and remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion in net cost savings from our cost realignment program by year-end. Q3 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.78 in the quarter and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.06, benefiting from our top line performance and efficient operating structure as well as a favorable tax rate driven primarily by jurisdictional mix. As mentioned last quarter, unique onetime items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results this quarter include a $420 million charge related to the expected sale of one of our facilities, resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program earlier this year. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of both maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. In the first 9 months of '24, we returned $7.1 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D and as we expected, completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to delevering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25x remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have delevered by approximately $4.4 billion, paying down approximately $2.3 billion in maturing debt and approximately $2.1 billion in commercial paper. And in October, we monetized another tranche of our Helion shares, which for reporting purposes is a Q4 event. We received approximately $3.5 billion in net cap proceeds, and our ownership in Helion was reduced from approximately 23% to approximately 15%. Year-to-date, we have received approximately $6.9 billion of net cash proceeds from the sale of our shares. We intend to monetize our remaining Helion investment in a prudent fashion considering our cash flow requirements and future market conditions. Overall, in Q3, we generated robust operating cash flows, which combined with the Helion net sale proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion, resulting in significant cash flow generation as we enter the fourth quarter. Our objective remains to delever and return to a more balanced allocation of capital between reinvestment and direct return to shareholders over time. Now let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the full year. Based on our focused execution and strong year-to-date results, we are raising our full year '24 revenue guidance by $1.5 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30. We now expect revenues in the range of $61 billion to $64 billion and operational revenue growth, excluding COVID-19 products is unchanged at 9% to 11% and takes into consideration reduction of sales associated with Oxbryta. COVID-19 product revenues are now expected to be $10.5 billion, $5 billion for COMIRNATY and $5.5 billion for PAXLOVID. Our guidance for adjusted SI&A, adjusted R&D and our effective tax rate on adjusted income remains unchanged. And last, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.95, primarily reflecting the top line increase and absorbing the Oxbryta impact. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs. Now as we begin to look towards next year, I want to touch on a few modeling considerations. As we've previously discussed, there are several nonrecurring items included in our 2024 results. First, during 2024, PAXLOVID revenue included a U.S. government revenue credit true-up and the fulfillment of our obligation to the U.S. National Strategic Stockpile. Second, given our ownership of Helion is now below 20%, we will no longer record equity income from that investment in our adjusted earnings beginning in 2025. And finally, our 2024 tax rate on adjusted income was favorably impacted by timing with respect to the impact of Pillar 2 and to a lesser extent, audit settlements. All in, these items are expected to have a favorable impact on full year 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.30. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter 2024 results and our overall performance this year. Our team remains dedicated to strong operational execution, and we believe our cost-saving programs will drive enhanced operating leverage over time that will enable us to consistently deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders. We are committed to driving long-term value creation through scientific leadership, portfolio strength and productivity across all aspects of our business. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Albert. Yes. So first, on the levering point, yes, our objective is to delever as rapidly as possible. And I think the company has been laser focused on doing that, given the fact that we've taken out about $4.4 billion in debt year-to-date, and we'll continue to do that. Secondly, without speaking directly around any potential BD opportunities here, is we're always looking to evaluate the infrastructure that we have and the assets that we currently maintain and understand if there's availability to, I'll say, monetize some of those assets over time to further support our delevering activity. So I would say all options are on the table, and we'll continue to evaluate on what makes the most sense for us strategically long term. Yes. So thank you. Regarding 2025, it's really topical because we're in the middle, as you can imagine, building our 2025 financial plan here across all of our business lines at -- to your point, there's going to be a lot of pushes and pulls as we think about growth into next year on both our core business as well as our COVID business. It is our expectation that we will provide guidance for 2025, most likely by the end of this year. So stay tuned, more to come. We will lay out all the pushes and pulls when we give guidance for 2025, so you can get a very clear understanding of our business and the opportunities to enhance shareholder value longer term. So I'll just hit on it very briefly. Obviously, the IRA and that [indiscernible] has pluses and pull -- pushes and pulls to us as we cycle into next year. When we provide guidance by the end of this year, we will give you a view on the net impact of that as we think about our business. So more to come, hold tight on that. Yes. On the guidance from a revenue perspective, you're absolutely correct. We increased our overall guidance by $1.5 billion. We increased PAXLOVID by 2, which implies that a $500 million compression in someplace else in the business, which is largely Oxbryta. We're absorbing the Oxbryta headwind and maintaining our 9% to 11% growth rate in our non-COVID business, which actually implies that our baseline business is actually performing quite well. So first, obviously, mid- to high 30s is very much within the realm of our business model. We're very focused against that. We continue to march and make progress against that over time. So we don't have a specific date for at this point in time. But as we continue to progress, both this year and we give guidance for next year, I'm sure you should see us completely progress on that front. Yes. Well, I think COMIRNATY obviously, is a down draft to that. So obviously, adjusted for the size of that business will be important. But having said that, we continue to make investments in our business such that we're more productive, top to bottom, therefore, expanding our operating margin profile of the company."

            "name": "Alexandre de Germay",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Even though it's not material yet, we're actually making very good progress. So on the adult front, we actually got BTC recommendations since the beginning of the year in large markets like U.K., Germany, in France, in Canada, in Australia, in Saudi Arabia and a lot of other midsized market positive share recommendation. Now we're moving into funding. And as you know, at the second quarter, we said that we won the exclusive U.K. tender. That's what we did. We also won the Canadian tender. Now in terms of reimbursement, we just got actually regional reimbursement in Germany, and we are launching [indiscernible] October in Germany. Now all the others, the large market and the client market that I've talked about, are in phase of negotiation. On the other side, the last thing I want to say is actually, we are working toward our immunobridging study in 2025 in China, so that we can do an NDA filing, which is also an important market for us. On the pediatric side, also, we are making good progress. We also got BTC recommendation in large markets like the U.K., in France, in Australia, in several other midsized markets. And actually, yesterday, we just got also the Pan-American Health Organization that covers 40 market in the Americas, that actually leased ABRYSVO in the RSV recommendation. So we're gaining also reimbursements in France. And we have actually just launched in France recently. There, again, on pediatric, once we got all those positive recommendations, we are moving into reimbursements. So we see great potential. It's going to take a bit of time because we go through all those statement steps, but we see good potential there. Absolutely. For international, this is Alexandre, thanks for the question, too. Same principles, we see enduring business. In COMIRNATY, just I want to remind everyone that in the International vision, we closed our third quarter at the end of August. So basically, you don't see any sales of COMIRNATY simply because most markets are starting of the vaccination campaign in September. Having said that, we are progressing very nicely in our key regions. So in Europe, we got the approval of the GEN-1 adapted vaccine in July, and we got the KP12 [indiscernible] September. So it's basically an [indiscernible] started to work with our health care authorities partner in Europe, where we have existing contract to implement the multiyear contract that is in place. Something in the U.K. and Canada, we've also worked with the authority to actually execute our contract. In Japan, we also got the GEN-1 adapted vaccine approved in mid-September. And COMIRNATY is actually the only PFS vaccine, never frozen, which could be a completed advantage considering the distribution model in Japan. So again, we see this as an enduring business and we see us as I said, executing our existing contracts in our key locations. So it's probably a -- PAXLOVID stands Q3 -- was a good Q3 for us, and it's actually very good because it satisfies of perception that actually is a sustainable business with sustainable demand, which coincides with the COVID wave. And we had quite a strong spring waves in Europe and Asia, and that translated into [indiscernible]. Just to close, I want to say that 47 countries outside of the U.S. have transitioned from advanced purchasing into commercial. So as we see in the U.S., it is an enduring and now the sales that we see quarter after quarter reflect the absolute demand and reflect the waves as they hit the different region of the world."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nFrancesca DeMartino: Good morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D; Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that we\u2019ve had a strong first half of the year and our business is performing well. We drove progress in the second quarter with solid execution as we continue making a difference in the lives of patients around the world. Through the first six months of 2024, we reached more than 192 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. Today, I\u2019ll provide updates about how we continued advancing our key strategic priorities in the second quarter. I will also mention examples from just the past few weeks when we have achieved a series of regulatory approvals, pipeline advances and other positive developments that we expect to fuel our progress through the rest of the year. We are pleased with the strong financial results coming from our disciplined execution. In the second quarter, for example, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues had reached peaked. Dave will talk about this and additional aspects of our financial performance, as well of course our outlook. And then, we will take questions. Before we go further, I will touch on some recent announcements about our leadership team and Board of Directors. I'll start with Mikael Dolsten\u2019s coming departure. It\u2019s hard to find words that do justice to the substantial impact Mikael has had during his 15-year tenure at Pfizer. Mikael transformed our R&D engine, ultimately delivering 35 approvals that have been meaningful for millions of patients globally. I thank my colleague, and my friend, for these tremendous contributions to human health. I look forward to working closely with him over the coming months as we search for his successor. Until then, Mikael will continue to lead as our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Pfizer Research & Development. I want to welcome Andrew Baum, our new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. Andrew brings deep clinical, scientific and biopharmaceutical sector expertise, and we are fortunate to have him to help shape and guide our strategy. While Andrew is not able to join us today because he is relocating with his family to the United States, he will be with us for future quarterly calls. I also want to mention the recent addition of Cyrus Taraporevala to our Board. We are committed to strong governance supported by directors with a breadth of unique experiences and skills, exactly like Cyrus. Cyrus was President and CEO at State Street Global Advisors until he retired, two years ago, and he brings vast experience in investment management and financial markets. We are thrilled to have him joining our board. Now, l'll turn to our performance. The five strategic priorities we shared at the beginning of the year remain unchanged. With our focus on the most important opportunities for advancing and strengthening our company, we are confident we remain on track in 2024. In the second quarter, our colleagues moved our business forward in each key strategic area. As a reminder, they are: achieving world-class oncology leadership, delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximizing performance of our new products, expanding margins by realigning our cost base, and allocating capital in ways that will enhance shareholder value. We believe we are well positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders. I want to reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividend over time. And, as Dave will discuss in more detail, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Now, I\u2019ll turn to our progress towards achieving the first one world-class oncology leadership. Last year, we acted on our bold vision of combining Seagen's transformative ADC medicines with Pfizer\u2019s expertise, innovation and scale. We believed we could help people with cancer live better and longer lives and capture a differentiated opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth for our company. At the halfway mark in 2024, we are on track to make this vision a reality and we are pleased with the continued success of our integration. We've had high rates of colleague retention and acquired Seagen products are contributing meaningfully to our revenues. In particular, Padcev is rapidly progressing toward becoming the standard of care for patients with frontline locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. We are pleased with the strength of other key products across our oncology portfolio. Xtandi, Lorbrena, Braftovi-Mektovi combination, for example, continued as significant growth drivers during this quarter. Our robust oncology commercial performance in the first half of 2024 included full FDA approval for Tivdak and European Medicines Agency approval for the Talzenna plus Xtandi combination. We also received positive CHMP opinions for the Braftovi-Mektovi combination and for Padcev. The last one is a notable development because Pfizer receives royalty revenues for these products marketed in Europe by our partners. These highlights illustrate how we are already delivering breakthroughs that dramatically improve the lives of people with cancer. Of course, we are also working to develop future breakthroughs where we have opportunities to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need. I will review several recent pipeline highlights, starting with obesity. Earlier this month, we announced our plans to move forward with development of danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist that is the most advanced candidate in our robust clinical and preclinical obesity pipeline. In previously reported results from the Phase 2b study in obesity, danuglipron demonstrated what we believe is good efficacy in its twice-daily formulation. For tolerability, we previously reported the maximum rate of GI adverse events across all doses investigated. Looking at individual dose levels in our Phase 2b study, however, we observed tolerability profiles that are competitive for the class. Our efforts are now focused on developing the once-daily formulation essential to delivering a competitive oral product. We were encouraged by a pharmacokinetic study evaluating multiple modified release technologies and formulations. This strengthened our confidence in potentially delivering a competitive once-daily pill at dose levels expected to be efficacious. We plan to conduct dose optimization studies in the second half of the year that are intended to inform our registration enabling studies. Obesity represents a growing area of patient need and it\u2019s a key area of focus for Pfizer's R&D programs. We believe these study results, along with learnings from our previous Phase 2 studies and data that we have accumulated from 1,400 participating patients, leave us well positioned to execute on a registration-enabling study as we work to deliver a competitive product in a rapidly growing market. When we hosted our Oncology Innovation Day in February, we shared the pipeline milestones that would mark our success over the next year and we are already demonstrating progress. A highlight was our strong presence at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting last month, which was anchored by three positive Phase 3 readouts. Follow-up data from the Phase 3 CROWN study of Lorbrena in patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer showed 60% of patients on Lorbrena who are living beyond five years without disease progression. This strengthens Lorbrena\u2019s position as an emerging standard of care in the frontline setting. Data from the Phase 3 ECHELON-3 study of Adcetris in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And, data from Phase 3 study evaluating an additional Adcetris combination regimen showed progression-free data in patients with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while significantly reducing side effects compared to a standard of care regimen used in Europe in this setting. We have advanced our oncology clinical pipeline in 2024 with Phase 3 studies for sigvotatug vedotin, our integrin beta 6-directed ADC; atirmociclib, our selective CDK4 inhibitor; Elrexfio in the second-line setting in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; and mevrometostat, our EZH2 inhibitor, which we are now moving to Phase 3 and anticipate enrollment beginning in August. We will continue working toward our 2030 oncology strategy goals of delivering eight or more blockbuster medicines and doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines. We also have momentum with our vaccine programs. In our next-gen PCV candidate, for example, we have advanced to a Phase 2 program in both adults and pediatrics, based on encouraging clinical data that we received that highlight our industry-leading capabilities in expanding valency beyond 20 serotypes. We expect to be highly competitive by offering the largest serotype coverage in a single vaccine while strategically addressing the persistent medical need across invasive disease, antibiotic resistance and challenging serotypes. In RSV with Abrysvo, I am pleased to report that yesterday we received an approval for Abrysvo's Act-O-Vial presentation in the United States, a presentation which offers advantages such as a never-frozen, unique system enabling one-step reconstitution highly valued by pharmacists. Additionally, we have submitted for label expansion in both the United States and Europe for adults 18 to 59. In our malignant hematology programs, we are also driving progress. Last week, we reported positive results from a Phase 3 study demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our one-time gene therapy candidate for people with hemophilia A. As we continue to advance our pipeline, additional milestones include expected updates later this year about our COVID/flu combination vaccine, marstacimab, for hemophilia A and B, and ponsegromab, for Cachexia, a wasting disorder associated with chronic disease. Now I\u2019ll turn to our strength with commercial execution of our business. Another strategic area of focus is protecting and growing our core product portfolios while we also maximize the performance of our new products. We continue to see encouraging progress with our team's execution. Nurtec is an example where we are rising to meet substantial demand. This product delivered strong results in the quarter with 44% year-over-year global operational revenue growth. We see additional opportunities for expanding share in both acute and prevention usage, as well as growth opportunities in international markets where we are making progress with our launches. I hope Alexandre will be able to touch based on this during the Q&A Session. Now, I will touch on a few additional product portfolio highlights. In the pediatric segment, Prevnar 20 continues to demonstrate strong performance that reinforces a leadership position among pneumococcal vaccines in the United States where market share grew to greater than 80%. During the quarter, the performance of Abrysvo was in line with seasonal vaccine trends. We remain confident in our full-year performance as we believe we are well positioned to help address the expected rising need later in the year among older adults at increased risk for RSV. Litfulo is a product we launched last year and we're encouraged by strong demand. Approximately one out of every two new patients on advanced systemic therapies is receiving a Litfulo prescription, a position we expect to grow as we continue focusing on execution. We view Velsipity as a promising and much-needed option for adults with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis. We're encouraged by recently securing preferred coverage for Velsipity at our first large national payer. We expect to see the impact of this in 2025 and now we're working to build on this with additional payers. When we consider core products in our portfolio, we are also seeing positive impact from strong execution. The Vyndaqel family of products offers a good example of how we are making a difference for patients and our business. We are accelerating growth by working with physicians to drive improvement in identifying appropriate patients with ATTR-cardiomyopathy and helping patients to access and stay on the therapy once it is prescribed. With strong growth through the second quarter, we believe there is additional opportunity to identify more patients who could benefit from our Vyndaqel products because of high unmet need. It is estimated that nearly half of those with this progressive and deadly disease have yet to be diagnosed. Eliquis was another significant contributor to our results as we continued to claim greater share in a growing oral anticoagulant market. Now, let me briefly wrap up. First, I\u2019d like to thank my more than 80,000 colleagues for the dedication they are showing each day to our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives. We are confident in our business. With our focus and execution, along with our deep expertise in driving innovation and advancing our pipeline, we believe we are on track to deliver on our full-year financial commitments in 2024. I walked through our progress with three of our strategic priorities and now Dave will cover our work to expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value as he discusses our financial performance and outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave.\nDave Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we close out the first half of the year, I\u2019m very pleased by our second quarter results. We continue our relentless focus on execution, demonstrating our ability to both protect and grow our core brands while also continuing to advance our science-led transformation by investing in key TAs to build durable franchises. Our initiatives to right size OpEx and reduce cost of goods will result in a more efficient organization, setting the stage for strong capital returns and long-term improved shareholder value enabling our commitment to both maintain and to grow our dividend. This morning, I will briefly review our second quarter results including some one-time items, touch on our capital allocation priorities, and wrap up with an update on our 2024 financial guidance, our key priorities, and expectations for the remainder of this year. Turning first to Q2 performance versus the same period last year; let\u2019s walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, reflecting operational growth of 3%. Our revenue and cash flow continue to be impacted by the post-pandemic COVID environment on a global basis but to a much lesser extent than prior quarters. Looking at the business excluding our COVID products, we demonstrated strong commercial execution across the enterprise, resulting in 14% operational revenue growth in the quarter. Performance was positively impacted by our continued focus on key products and geographies; refined allocation of commercial field resources globally; and further optimization of our marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance was our acquired products from Seagen as well as Nurtec, alongside in-line products Vyndaqel, Eliquis and Xtandi. As expected, dampening our growth in the quarter were Xeljanz and Ibrance. Adjusted Gross Margin for the second quarter was 79%, compared to 76% last year, and was primarily the result of favorable sales mix from our non-COVID products, as well as continued strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be a focus for the company over the next few years as we execute on our recently announced Manufacturing Optimization Program. This new program and together with our cost realignment program is focused on returning the company to pre-pandemic operating margins on a mix adjusted basis excluding Comirnaty. Phase 1 of the Manufacturing Optimization Program, which focuses on operational efficiencies, is well underway now. This first phase is expected to deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027, some of which is anticipated to be realized beginning in 2025. Total Adjusted operating expenses increased by 5% operationally to $6.3 billion and include spending from our legacy Seagen business. Looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 8% driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched as well as acquired products. Adjusted R&D expenses increased 2% operationally driven primarily by increased spending related to the acquisition of Seagen, partially offset by lower spending primarily the result of our cost realignment program. Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.01 and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60. Unique one-time items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results, this quarter include a $1.3 billion charge related to our Manufacturing Optimization Program primarily for severance, and a $230 million charge for IPR&D asset impairment and other related costs associated with the discontinuation of our DMD program. Additionally, we expect to record a charge of approximately $400 million in the third quarter of 2024 after a decision was made in July to sell one of our facilities as a result of the discontinuation of the DMD effort. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return; and finally making value enhancing share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. In the first half of 2024, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D; and as expected, the completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to de-levering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25 times remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have paid down approximately $2.25 billion in maturing debt, including $1 billion in May of outstanding notes. And though we did not monetize any Haleon shares in Q2, we expect to resume monetization of our 23% Haleon stake in the future. I would also note that once our Haleon ownership is less than 20%, our accounting will transition from recording equity income and will no longer be included in our adjusted results. This change is factored into our long-term financial planning and as well as our guidance. As we\u2019ve previously stated previously, we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels this year and particularly during the first half of 2024, due to the timing of certain payments and one-time expenses. We expect heavily weighting of revenues to the fourth quarter as our business has become more seasonal in nature with the potential that a high level of cash collections may carry over into Q1 of 2025. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective remains to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. Now, let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of the year. We entered 2024 focused on delivering on our financial commitments as well as commercial performance. With a successful first half now complete, we believe it is appropriate to update our full year earnings outlook to reflect our strong business performance. I\u2019ll remind you that our revised guidance assumes the seasonal cadence of our product portfolio, and that we expect Paxlovid results to trend with infection rates. With that said, we are raising our full year revenue range by $1 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30. We now expect revenues in the range of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion and operational revenue growth excluding COVID products is projected to be 9% to 11%. COVID product revenues are now expected to be $8.5 billion for the year; $5 billion for Comirnaty and $3.5 billion for Paxlovid. Our guidance for adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D remains unchanged while our effective tax rate on adjusted income is now expected to be approximately 13%; and, lastly, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.65 primarily reflecting the increase to the top line and the revised tax rate among other items. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing cost. In closing, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of this year. This improvement in our cost base alongside our new initiatives focused on manufacturing is expected to put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns. Additionally, our continued focus on execution and our recent investments have positioned the company for continued success moving forward. This quarter\u2019s results are a testament to the performance of our commercial business and our prudent approach to improving our cost base. Though we\u2019ve had a strong first half, we do not take lightly the continued focus needed to deliver in the second half considering the seasonality of our respiratory products. We are clearly striving to bring about improved performance on both the top and bottom lines through focus, execution and delivering on our near-term commercial and financial goals. 2024 is clearly a foundation year for Pfizer. Our achievements to date sets the stage for generating compelling shareholder value. Through our science-led transformation, we will methodically build off this base and with breakthroughs and innovation driving growth in the back half of the decade. And with that, I\u2019d now like to turn it back over to Albert to start our Q&A.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you, Dave. Let\u2019s start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask you on danuglipron, when do you expect to see the actual efficacy data and if this product moves forward as anticipated, how hard would it be for you to manufacture?\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael, you want to address it very quickly.\nMikael Dolsten: Yes. We are, as Albert said in the oral remarks, doing the dose optimization for PK and formulation to select potential doses for pending data progression to Phase 3 and we expect to share that first quarter.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And just thinking about the cost guidance, cost measures here, just wanted to understand, how should we think about the margin expansion for the rest of the year. And then how should we think about it going forward in 2025 and 2026, especially as you head into the IRA territory?\nAlbert Bourla: Perfect question for Dave.\nDave Denton: Yes. So Mohit, just a couple of things. As you recall in my prepared remarks, we are focused on actually launched our manufacturing optimization program, the result of which will begin to yield results in 2025 and to generate over $1.5 billion in savings by 2027. As we think about margin expansion, just given the guidance that I provided for the balance of this year, it would imply that margin \u2013 gross margin rates would actually improve versus the low-70s color that we\u2019ve given previously to probably mid-70s at this point in time. We do expect that all these investments, both our cost realignment program and our investments from a manufacturing optimization program are all designed to improve operating margins to get us back to pre-pandemic levels in the near future.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Dave. Operator, the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering, had two on the new product cycle side, how are you guys thinking about this upcoming RSV season? As we think about patients coming back in for a booster, as well as maybe an existing new group of patients coming in. And then on Elrexfio and myeloma, can you give us any color on the launch, either sales or market share there? And if you're still confident in that $4 billion opportunity, thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you, Terence, and very good questions. RSV, why don't Aamir and then Alexandre speak about the Royalty? And then Chris, you covered alerts.\nAamir Malik: Hey, Terence, it's Aamir. For Abrysvo, I think we are very well positioned going into the fall season in the U.S. for three main reasons. One is contracting. So we've significantly strengthened our contracting position. Many of those decisions were confirmed shortly after the June ACIP and are set to take effect in August, commensurate with the beginning of the season. The second is the ACIP guidance itself, with a recommendation for a single dose for all adults over 75 and those 60 to 74 that are at increased risk. We think that is just clear and strengthens the directive for those who are eligible for a vaccine. And then thirdly, is just Abrysvo itself. We've got great data, including two seasons of durable efficacy data. As Albert alluded to earlier, we have both our current needle free reconstitution kit that is never required to be frozen or thawed, as well as our new active biosystem, which offers many advantages and including 80% storage efficiency, so there's good options for customers. And I will also remind you that there's many healthcare providers and pharmacies that prefer simplifying their vaccine management by having one vaccine for both older adults and maternal, which only a Abrysvo can offer. So the combination of contracting, the ACIP guidance and the value proposition of Abrysvo positions as well in the U.S.\nAlbert Bourla: And Alexandre, what about international markets.\nAlexandre de Germay: Yes, Terence, good question on Abrysvo. We are making great progress as well on the international fronts following the approval, remember, in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the UK. We already are progressing nicely with vaccine technical committee recommending positively Abrysvo. So we got positive recommendation in the UK, in France, in Canada, in Australia and several other markets and in Saudi Arabia as well. So we are moving very nicely. Delighted that actually UK authority have selected Abrysvo for RSV prevention in older adults as well as in maternal immunization for pediatric for the next two years with an option of additional two years. And we also were selected in Canada specifically also for adult vaccination.\nAlbert Bourla: Good news for file and let's go to Chris now.\nChris Boshoff: Thank you for the question on Elrexfio. As you saw, we recently demonstrated the updated median overall survival data for Elrexfio in the intent to treat 123 patient population in the late-line disease, where we see an overall survival of 24.3 months, which we believe is differentiated. Elrexfio also have a differentiated profile in terms of the safety profile as well as other factors including subcutaneous administration, flat non-weight-based dosing and a flexible dosing regimen overall. We've now launched in 16 countries and in fact in Japan, we were the first to launch and it's early days. We've also recently got approval in the EU and UK. In the U.S., total demand is plus 40% growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter and early next year or during 2025, you'll see the readouts for the bigger opportunities, which is MagnetisMM-5 in the double-class exposed population and then later in the year, potentially MagnetisMM-32, which is post-CD38. So overall, we remain confident that we've got a very differentiated molecule that could become a backbone across the continuum of care for multiple myeloma.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Hammond with Bank of America.\nAlex Hammond: Thanks for taking the question. On Nurtec, can you walk us through the commercial strategy to expand share and acute and preventive usage, as well as the international markets. You've mentioned focusing on physician awareness in a different way and reducing friction for patient access any more color you can provide there. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Great questions. Aamir and then Alexandre.\nAamir Malik: Alex, on Nurtec in the U.S., I think there are a number of things that we've done in the first half of the year to strengthen our demand. So we revamp all of our consumer activation efforts. We sharpened the clinical value proposition and how we communicated that, including, but not only limited to the fact that we have an indication for treatment and prevention. We also realigned our field forces to ensure that we're really maximizing activation of both primary care and neurologist providers. And then we made a lot of efforts through the co-pay support and other means to just reduce friction in patients actually getting access to Nurtec once a script is written. And so what you see this quarter for us is a combination of all of those things starting to take effect. So Nurtec TRx was up 28% over the prior year. Revenues were up close to 39% in the U.S. We maintain leadership from a TRx and NRx perspective at 49% and 48% share, respectively. And there were 9,000 new Nurtec writers. So that's about 85% of all new CGRP writers. So as we look forward, we continue to see strength in Nurtec demand. We'll continue to manage the gross to net dynamics of that business, but we are optimistic about where we take it from here.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Alexandre?\nAlexandre de Germay: Yes. On the international front, we also have expanded access and the numbers of countries that we have introduced the product. As you know, the growth that you see in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2024 is really the effect of the introduction of Nurtec in China at the beginning of this quarter. As of today, we have Nurtec reimbursed in 15 countries, including some of our key markets like UK, Spain. And what we see is once we get reimbursement, we had a significant uplift of the demand. And so our focus now is to increase access and reimbursement in some of our key markets. Moving forward, we see significant growth behind Nurtec. And the reason behind that is there is to the international level, less than half of the diagnosed patients that are treated with prescription medicine. So that's why we think we have an opportunity with Nurtec.\nAlbert Bourla: And I believe, Alexandre, that this year, we got almost 55 countries registered Nurtec in international markets, 55 markets on [indiscernible] 15 received already reimbursement, and we are waiting for the remaining 40 to receive reimbursement. Let's move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\nAkash Tewari: Hey, thanks so much. On next-gen Prevnar, your team has been fairly quiet on its profile. Let's say that the next-gen product only hits 27 serotypes and not 31 like some of your peers. Why should we feel confident that Pfizer can retain a lion's share position in this market? And you mentioned the next-gen product actually having the largest serotype coverage. Does that imply greater than 31 serotypes of coverage?\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Thank you. As you know, we have worked over several decades in optimizing how to expand the number of serotypes while maintaining strong immune responses for as many as possible. We have not disclosed yet how many serotypes we have. We have recently pursued expansion of that next-gen into Phase 2 of both pediatric and adult and look forward to adult data to come quite soon, which will allow us to move swiftly in that indication. We have made significant improvement on existing and new serotypes through new technologies. And that is a deep capability. So it's not just about having the highest number of serotypes. It's really to show the consistency and the data before you can draw any conclusion. So we remain very confident in our ability to defend our leadership position and continue to expand it through these new technology tool bots.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Mikael. Next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. I want to ask you about your views on the IRA, in particular, implications on revenue outlook for 2025 and 2026. Obviously, your employees, your partner Bristol on Eliquis made commentary that I think has been interpreted by the Street as being that this is a dynamic that could be manageable. We appreciate your specific reflections on the Pfizer portfolio. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Thanks, Chris. I will ask Aamir to speak a little bit about the Eliquis specifically. And then, Dave, can you cover the general impact of IRA?\nAamir Malik: Chris, as you noted, BMS led the discussions with CMS on Eliquis maximum fair price because they are the NDA holder, and they shared their perspective on that process during their earnings call last week. Honestly, we don't have much to add to what they said. We share their view that we have the ability to navigate the impact of IRA on Eliquis. And Eliquis will be an important drug in our portfolio for the foreseeable future.\nDave Denton: Yes. And then I would just add to that, as we look at IRA across our platform, first, I think we were very fortunate Pfizer that we had one product selected. And secondly, if you look at the remaining products that are likely to be \u2013 that could potentially be selected, they are nearing the end of their patent protection life. So if you think about it from a net present value perspective, the impact on Pfizer is somewhat muted as you think about it economically. I will say this is a piece of legislation that clearly is harmful for supporting research and development in the sector. So we're hopeful that this could be changed in the future, but we will continue to actively manage our way through this.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Dave. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners.\nDave Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. And I guess I just wanted to start off by saying congratulations and best of luck to you, Mikael. So my questions are, first, could you please comment on your expectations for Phase 1 obesity candidates beyond once-daily danuglipron, including disclosures to watch over the next several months? And then second, Dave, could you just contextualize the $1.5 billion in COGS reductions relative to the current annual run rate of about $15 billion? It seems like you're going to cut 10%. But how should we think about net reduction i.e., net COGS declines over the next three years? Thanks so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Mikael, why don't you give a little bit on the obesity candidates other than danu?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes Yes. As you heard from Albert, danu is the more advanced drug with a large tolerability, safety and efficacy experience. As always, in our projects, we have additional drugs in the same class. It's in Phase 1, performing as expected. We have another mechanism of action that would combine with Oral GLP [ph] such as danu later in development of life cycle. And we have other mechanisms to protect part in kidney that could also be part of an internal medicine, larger cardiometabolic franchise. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: And what about the cost reduction?\nDave Denton: So let me just anchor us on a few facts here. First, the cost reduction effort that we currently have initiated is Phase 1 of a multiple-phase program. So this $1.5 billion savings is only a part of \u2013 or a piece of the story. We will tell more of the story as we define the program more specifically so you get more clarity on that. Secondly, if you look at the $1.5 billion cost improvement effort, and you think about that on our cost of goods sold platform, where it's probably closer to $16 billion versus $15 billion, this is at anchor point.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities.\nKripa Devarakonda: Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. I have a question on the RSV in maternal market. How has \u2013 have you gained traction in the maternal market? Are you seeing any sort of setbacks? Just wondering if Pfizer needs to educate, build out or do some groundwork before the market really breaks open. And then a follow-up question on PADCEV, there are other radioligands and ADCs that are targeting Nectin-4. Are there \u2013 how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Aamir about maternal RSV.\nAamir Malik: Sure, Kripa. So thanks for the question. I think let me start by just underscoring the interest that we see on maternal vaccination. So when you talk to OB/GYNs, there's a clear preference that they have to vaccinate during pregnancy. And similarly, you hear the same from pregnant mothers. Greater than 60% prefer vaccination versus vaccinating the baby, maternal vaccination. So our launch on maternal did exceed our expectations. So we saw uptake rates through the end of January with about 11% of eligible mothers taking the vaccine. And that is significantly higher than other maternal immunization at the same point in the life cycle. I think key Tdap was less than 2% at the same time. So the other thing I will note is it does require education, as you know. And last year's maternal ACIP recommendation occurred just after the RSV maternal vaccination season began. So this season, we have the benefit of using the first half of the year to invest in that education of both HCPs as well as pregnant women, and we look forward to the season ahead.\nAlbert Bourla: And international anything to add?\nAlexandre de Germay: Yes, very, very few points. Just to say that following the approval, we also have great progress on the vaccine technical committee on vaccination in maternal in the UK we receive positive recommendation as well as in France, in Australia, Belgium, Austria, Argentina, so many other, including an interesting one, which is the power for Latin America. And now we are progressing into access \u2013 final access into those markets.\nAlbert Bourla: And about the competitiveness of Padcev, Chris?\nChris Boshoff: Thank you for the question. We\u2019re very pleased that in this quarter, as you\u2019ve seen, we printed just shy of $400 million for Padcev with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 15%. Based on the claims data through the end of May, we are seeing U.S. first-line share increasing into the low 50% range. And as you know, the next opportunity is obviously in muscle invasive bladder cancer with two ongoing studies being conducted by Merck, which can expand the population to an additional 28,000 addressable patients. So overall, we are seeing that Padcev with pembrolizumab is becoming entrenched in the first-line setting as the standard of care and future studies, including future nectin-targeted medicines, radioligands or ADCs will likely have to do studies against Padcev plus pembrolizumab in the first-line setting, which could be challenging.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS.\nTrung Huynh: Hi guys. Thanks for the questions. Firstly, on Prevnar, there wasn\u2019t so much commentary in your prepared remarks here. Just interested for the quarter, was that impacted by any one-offs? And has there been any stocking dynamics or destocking at play here, given the approval of [indiscernible] and that anticipated launch? And then secondly, just at ASCO, we saw some early KAT6 data in breast. The presenter was very, very excited. Can you perhaps talk about the opportunity here? How quickly can we get this through clinical studies? And when can we see the next set of longer-term data? Thanks very much.\nAlbert Bourla: Aamir, what about this, the stocking?\nAamir Malik: Yes. So on Prevnar, I\u2019ll just provide context on the U.S. performance dynamics. So the change year-over-year is predominantly a result of lower adult demand due to shrinkage of the opportunity size in that market. And the quarter-to-quarter change that you see is a function of the CDC order timing for pediatric vaccines, which tends to be quite lumpy as well as some of the adult vaccination dynamics of both shrinkage and seasonality. And I think it\u2019s important to continue to think about these two segments very differently in the U.S. So with pediatrics, as Albert had mentioned in his remarks, we exited Q2 with a share of 81%, which is up 71% in August. And then the adult market continues to behave differently in the U.S. in that it is contracting because there are just fewer eligible 65-plus adults and a more difficult-to-activate younger population. And that\u2019s the same population that Merck\u2019s V116 will be launching into.\nAlbert Bourla: And in the international market?\nAlexandre de Germay: International, as you see first quarter, second quarter together for the first half, we grew by 2%, and this is in line with our expectation. What we see is, of course, we are going to capitalize on the very strong franchise that we are in Prevnar 13 with 140 exclusive NIP around the globe. And so as we get Prevnar 20 pediatric we are going to launch this product and switch from 13 to 20. Now in adults, it\u2019s a very interesting dynamic because in adults, our vaccination was in Europe and outside of the country is quite limited. Now that we see Prevnar 20 registered and validated by VTC, we see significant pickup. And let me give you an example. In Germany, we got VTC recommendations for 60 and above, all-comers and at risk, from 18 to 59. And there, in Germany, since the beginning of the year, we see significant growth. We see that we will have similar trends in other major markets in Europe.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. And Chris?\nChris Boshoff: Thank you very much for the question on KAT6. KAT6 is a first in category medicine. We\u2019re very proud that this medicine was conceptualized and discovered at our laboratories in Ohio. As you\u2019ve seen with the most recent data, objective response rate over 35% durable responses and well tolerated. We therefore plan to initiate a Phase 3 program over the next six months, and you\u2019ll learn more about that. But thank you for the question. We\u2019re also excited about KAT6.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. We are very excited about it. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first one, just a clarification. I guess when we think about the PK danuglipron data, the top line, on a month ago, are we going to see any of that data prior to the dose optimization data reading out early next year? And then as we think about timelines for danuglipron, some of your European peers have talked about potentially moving faster. And I think some of the timelines that are generally thrown out there, including potentially reaching market as early as 2028. Did Pfizer have sort of similar plans or think such plans would be feasible for danuglipron? Any color on that front would be helpful. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Mikael?\nMikael Dolsten: Yes, for your questions, we\u2019ll likely present a comprehensive data set on PK after collecting all the data from the two studies, but we are looking into what\u2019s the best way to sharing it timely. We have some of the most aggressive timelines when we agree a protocol with regulatory agency and pending data. And as Albert has said, if that becomes the case that we move forward pending data, you can bet that like every Pfizer program, it will be very fast.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Just two questions for me. Just coming back to danu again. I guess just bigger picture, do you expect the once-daily formulation will have an improved tolerability profile versus the twice daily? And maybe part of it as we think about the additional data you\u2019re getting, will you get additional efficacy or tolerability data from these ongoing studies? Or is it really just PK, just as you\u2019re trying to make a decision here. I just want to try to better understand what you\u2019re going to have available to consider? And then the second question I had was just on RSV. It sounds like some encouraging contracting updates. But can you just elaborate a bit more on the market as a whole? Is this a market you expect to grow in the U.S. this year is on one hand I\u2019m balancing more visibility on who should be targeted and covered post ACIP. But at the same time there's no revax recommendation yet. And there could be maybe some challenges for pharmacies trying to figure out who's high risk and who's not in that 60 to 74-year old population. So just like balance those two together, do you expect the market as a whole is growing this year? Thank you.\nDave Denton: Chris. Given that, for the interest of time let me tell you about Daniel. We have said it multiple times that is going to be PK data right now. We have done with Daniel 1,400 pace, so we feel very comfortable about the profile, we know the product. Right now the question is if we have a formulation that will allow us to take this product into Phase 3 registration enabling studies. We made an announcement because we feel that what we saw from the first round of testing multiple formulations, we felt encouraged that we have several that can deliver and one, but it was the preferred one and it is the one, but because it was the best of all, and now we are going to test it. Also we can speculate if tolerability will be better or not because of once a day compares to twice a day because we don't have the data. But as whis [ph], I said in my prepared remarks for DANUBE, the profile that the DANUBE right now has based on the 1400 patients that we have seen is very competitive both on tolerability and efficacy. With whatever we have seen from others in the oral space so far. And in terms of timing, right now with everything we know we are the only one with 2b data on an oral GLP-1 after, of course, Lilly. So right now for everything we know, we should be the second after Lilly if DANUBE progressed into registration enabling studies. Now let's go to RSV, Aamir.\nAamir Malik: So Chris, what I would say is we are only in the second season now of a expanding market, right. So you had the first season last year, this year with the ACIP recommendation. As I mentioned earlier, we think that that provides clarity and it strengthens the need for those identified in the recommendation to get a vaccine. And we've had another six months plus of opportunity to educate HCPs as well as consumers, and we see growing relevancy and urgency of people to vaccinate. So we do think that the opportunity set expands.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. Going back to IRA, so CMS is bound to make the disclosure of negotiated prices on this first list of ten drugs a very big production, it will claim it's a major win over the industry. Of course, it depends on how those prices compare to net prices, not list. My understanding is it's possible we get this news from CMS earlier than September 1st, possibly this week ahead of the congressional recess in early August. Do you agree it's possible we might get this news early? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: I don't know. They have the decision making, so they will do what they think. I can't comment on that. I know have discussed that thing, but \u2013 so I will emphasize once more, if CMS says that that was a big win for them against the pharma industry, what I would say it was the whole law of IRA. It is a very big loss for innovation and for the crown jewel of American industry, which is the Life Science Technology business. But it is what it is. It is the law of the land. And we are doing our best to make sure that we minimize any impact, particularly in the future, because for now, as Dave said, we were probably in the next few years, the NPV [ph] that are at stake for us, It's quite small because most, we were fortunate not to have up to four products selected only one. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you so much. Two questions. First, do you expect VYNDAQEL to grow up to the LOE or will competitors pressure sales and take majority share before that? Certainly seems VYNDAQEL faces some significant challenge? And secondly, assuming no booster doses, does Pfizer still peg peak RSV vaccine sales at 2 billion plus? That was guidance first provided in December 2022 and do you think you can capture a majority share this fall? Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Aamir, why don't you take the first one?\nAamir Malik: Sure. So Steve, on VYNDA maybe what's going on now and then what's to come with competition. So VYNDA is continuing to grow at a very healthy clip. This is a result of multiple factors, a very important one of which is we focused on expanding our HCP base that we're targeting as well as really investing in diagnosing and identifying patients. Diagnosis remains the biggest unmet need in this condition because there's almost half of patients that are still undiagnosed. So we do see a lot of growth opportunity in VYNDA. Now for this year it may not continue as the same clip that we've seen in Q1 and Q2, because we had a big bolus of enrollment patients in the beginning of the year, partially as a result of some of the IRA reforms, and the incremental diagnoses become harder and harder to find. But we do expect continued growth with VYNDAQEL. As far as competition, there's still a lot that needs to be understood exactly about the competitors, their data, their profile, what actions they're going to take. But what I will say is that we obviously welcome more treatment options for patients, but there's a lot that we're very confident in with VYNDA. There's a body of clinical evidence that includes five-year follow-up clinical trial data, and real world evidence including statistically significant mortality and CV hospitalization data that is in our label, as well as quality of life benefits that we think continue to position VYNDA well. But of course, with competition coming in, we will take that into consideration and provide further guidance as things evolve.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. And again, in the interest of time, Steve, for the RSV, when we provided $2 billion was in the frame of a pipeline asset. What is the key potential annually? We don't give once the products are registered, typically projections not even for the next year, not for the peak years, but what I would say if everything \u2013 if anything, things have become more promising since the time that we gave this $2 billions, because we were all surprised how much the medical community and the recommended authorities are putting emphasis on the disease. So that's my comment. Sorry I couldn't be more specific to you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple I could. One, you talked about the aggressive timeline that obesity. I assume for PCV next-gen, it's similarly aggressive. Maybe you just comment on sort of the time you think it would take to get that product to market, given you're now in Phase 2, and then the second one is more related to Paxlovid. In the first quarter, you had the big adjustment and you came in well above expectation, but to not raise the guidance now this quarter, you are raising the guidance. I'm curious if you can comment on anything you're seeing, sort of in the channels or what driving the confidence to raise the guidance now and then so tied to that, is that the main driver of, sort of the increased gross margin? So expectations. And is that just the product mix and cost management sort of combination, but just seeing if you can maybe parse out some of the main drivers of that impact. Thank you.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. For the next-gen, I\u2019ll make it easy. We announced that we entered into Phase 2 studies, both in pediatric, and so one can calculate, you can't comment how long we take because these are event-driven studies, particularly when you go into Phase 3, right. So we don't know how long that will take, but. And we don't comment at this stage, but let's go to Paxlovid and explain the dynamics, Aamir.\nAamir Malik: Yes. So for Pax in the U.S., you pointed to the momentum in Q1, which I'll remind you was a combination of both the true-up as well as ongoing utilization that was very high given the wave of COVID infection. What happened then is in the first half of Q2 infections were low. And the very clear trend that we see with Paxlovid is when there is a COVID infection wave, we have healthy Paxlovid utilization. So starting in May, all the way through June, there was increased COVID infection waves and our Paxlovid utilization followed. So we had about 35,000 treatment courses a week in April and May, peaking to about 100,000 in June. So we have seen continued utilization. Now it is trickier for the wholesalers and end customers to manage utilization around the disease. That's a little bit unpredictable. So we did enter Q2 with higher than normal inventory levels, but the wave of utilization that we've seen in Q2 has helped normalize those inventory levels. And all of this dynamic combined with the fact that we've built a commercial model to successfully get Paxlovid to those who need it, including very healthy coverage with commercial payers, 90% of pharmacies across the U.S. already participating in our USG PAP program, and a simplified model for delivering that PAP program to patients when there is a COVID infection wave. We're confident about Paxlovid utilization.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Thank you, Aamir.\nDave Denton: And just real quickly, as you think about the guidance, I think your question was, was this, what was driving our improvement and guidance? This was one of many factors because our core business in general is doing quite well and our cost management programs are really taking hold. So this is one of multiple factors that drove that $0.30 raise.\nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Dave. And also Vamil, I realized that I misspoke before when I said that it is event-driven, the next-gen. It is not. It's immunogenicity. Also, I can offer another point for you to try to estimate the timelines that next year, we expect to have the regulatory discussions about how the program should look like, and then we will form better understanding when we can have the Phase 3 readout. Next question, please. And I think the last question, operator last question, please. We cannot hear the operator. Sorry for this technical problem. The technician just told me to wait a moment, please. Otherwise we will stop the call here.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: Hey, guys, thank you for squeezing me in at the end. I would love for some comments on VYNDAQEL given the strength this quarter; you really came in ahead of consensus. Do you expect this continuing in the back half of the year into 2025, and just given the IP in the next couple of years expiring, what can you do to extend this, given the strength of this franchise? Thank you so much.\nAlbert Bourla: Aamir?\nAamir Malik: Hey, Evan. So, a bit as I mentioned earlier, yes, we do expect to see continued growth momentum for VYNDA in the back half of this year and going forward for the reasons I described earlier. It may not be at the level that we saw in the first half of the year because of the Q1 bolus of patients, but the combination of what we're doing in terms of physician expansion, investment in driving diagnosis, and tailwinds from IRA reform do give us conviction around short term VYNDAQEL growth.\nAlbert Bourla: Yes. And when it comes to, IP right now, it's very difficult, once the product is getting generic, to be able to fight with a new molecule unless you have substantial differentiation. And, VYNDAQEL has tremendous efficacy. So we do not expect that the market will continue being as big, particularly for us, after we see generics entering into it. So thank you for the question. So I want to make some just closing remarks that we had a very strong first half of the year, and we are confident that we will deliver on our full year financial commitments in 2024. We are driving progress with solid execution as we continue to serve patients and grow our business, execution makes the difference. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and we hope you have a wonderful.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Yes, Terence, good question on Abrysvo. We are making great progress as well on the international fronts following the approval, remember, in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the UK. We already are progressing nicely with vaccine technical committee recommending positively Abrysvo. So we got positive recommendation in the UK, in France, in Canada, in Australia and several other markets and in Saudi Arabia as well. So we are moving very nicely. Delighted that actually UK authority have selected Abrysvo for RSV prevention in older adults as well as in maternal immunization for pediatric for the next two years with an option of additional two years. And we also were selected in Canada specifically also for adult vaccination. Yes. On the international front, we also have expanded access and the numbers of countries that we have introduced the product. As you know, the growth that you see in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2024 is really the effect of the introduction of Nurtec in China at the beginning of this quarter. As of today, we have Nurtec reimbursed in 15 countries, including some of our key markets like UK, Spain. And what we see is once we get reimbursement, we had a significant uplift of the demand. And so our focus now is to increase access and reimbursement in some of our key markets. Moving forward, we see significant growth behind Nurtec. And the reason behind that is there is to the international level, less than half of the diagnosed patients that are treated with prescription medicine. So that's why we think we have an opportunity with Nurtec. Yes, very, very few points. Just to say that following the approval, we also have great progress on the vaccine technical committee on vaccination in maternal in the UK we receive positive recommendation as well as in France, in Australia, Belgium, Austria, Argentina, so many other, including an interesting one, which is the power for Latin America. And now we are progressing into access \u2013 final access into those markets. International, as you see first quarter, second quarter together for the first half, we grew by 2%, and this is in line with our expectation. What we see is, of course, we are going to capitalize on the very strong franchise that we are in Prevnar 13 with 140 exclusive NIP around the globe. And so as we get Prevnar 20 pediatric we are going to launch this product and switch from 13 to 20. Now in adults, it's a very interesting dynamic because in adults, our vaccination was in Europe and outside of the country is quite limited. Now that we see Prevnar 20 registered and validated by VTC, we see significant pickup. And let me give you an example. In Germany, we got VTC recommendations for 60 and above, all-comers and at risk, from 18 to 59. And there, in Germany, since the beginning of the year, we see significant growth. We see that we will have similar trends in other major markets in Europe."

            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Francesca. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that we've had a strong first half of the year and our business is performing well. We drove progress in the second quarter with solid execution as we continue making a difference in the lives of patients around the world. Through the first six months of 2024, we reached more than 192 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. Today, I'll provide updates about how we continued advancing our key strategic priorities in the second quarter. I will also mention examples from just the past few weeks when we have achieved a series of regulatory approvals, pipeline advances and other positive developments that we expect to fuel our progress through the rest of the year. We are pleased with the strong financial results coming from our disciplined execution. In the second quarter, for example, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022 when our COVID revenues had reached peaked. Dave will talk about this and additional aspects of our financial performance, as well of course our outlook. And then, we will take questions. Before we go further, I will touch on some recent announcements about our leadership team and Board of Directors. I'll start with Mikael Dolsten's coming departure. It's hard to find words that do justice to the substantial impact Mikael has had during his 15-year tenure at Pfizer. Mikael transformed our R&D engine, ultimately delivering 35 approvals that have been meaningful for millions of patients globally. I thank my colleague, and my friend, for these tremendous contributions to human health. I look forward to working closely with him over the coming months as we search for his successor. Until then, Mikael will continue to lead as our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Pfizer Research & Development. I want to welcome Andrew Baum, our new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. Andrew brings deep clinical, scientific and biopharmaceutical sector expertise, and we are fortunate to have him to help shape and guide our strategy. While Andrew is not able to join us today because he is relocating with his family to the United States, he will be with us for future quarterly calls. I also want to mention the recent addition of Cyrus Taraporevala to our Board. We are committed to strong governance supported by directors with a breadth of unique experiences and skills, exactly like Cyrus. Cyrus was President and CEO at State Street Global Advisors until he retired, two years ago, and he brings vast experience in investment management and financial markets. We are thrilled to have him joining our board. Now, l'll turn to our performance. The five strategic priorities we shared at the beginning of the year remain unchanged. With our focus on the most important opportunities for advancing and strengthening our company, we are confident we remain on track in 2024. In the second quarter, our colleagues moved our business forward in each key strategic area. As a reminder, they are: achieving world-class oncology leadership, delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximizing performance of our new products, expanding margins by realigning our cost base, and allocating capital in ways that will enhance shareholder value. We believe we are well positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders. I want to reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividend over time. And, as Dave will discuss in more detail, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Now, I'll turn to our progress towards achieving the first one world-class oncology leadership. Last year, we acted on our bold vision of combining Seagen's transformative ADC medicines with Pfizer's expertise, innovation and scale. We believed we could help people with cancer live better and longer lives and capture a differentiated opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth for our company. At the halfway mark in 2024, we are on track to make this vision a reality and we are pleased with the continued success of our integration. We've had high rates of colleague retention and acquired Seagen products are contributing meaningfully to our revenues. In particular, Padcev is rapidly progressing toward becoming the standard of care for patients with frontline locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. We are pleased with the strength of other key products across our oncology portfolio. Xtandi, Lorbrena, Braftovi-Mektovi combination, for example, continued as significant growth drivers during this quarter. Our robust oncology commercial performance in the first half of 2024 included full FDA approval for Tivdak and European Medicines Agency approval for the Talzenna plus Xtandi combination. We also received positive CHMP opinions for the Braftovi-Mektovi combination and for Padcev. The last one is a notable development because Pfizer receives royalty revenues for these products marketed in Europe by our partners. These highlights illustrate how we are already delivering breakthroughs that dramatically improve the lives of people with cancer. Of course, we are also working to develop future breakthroughs where we have opportunities to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need. I will review several recent pipeline highlights, starting with obesity. Earlier this month, we announced our plans to move forward with development of danuglipron, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist that is the most advanced candidate in our robust clinical and preclinical obesity pipeline. In previously reported results from the Phase 2b study in obesity, danuglipron demonstrated what we believe is good efficacy in its twice-daily formulation. For tolerability, we previously reported the maximum rate of GI adverse events across all doses investigated. Looking at individual dose levels in our Phase 2b study, however, we observed tolerability profiles that are competitive for the class. Our efforts are now focused on developing the once-daily formulation essential to delivering a competitive oral product. We were encouraged by a pharmacokinetic study evaluating multiple modified release technologies and formulations. This strengthened our confidence in potentially delivering a competitive once-daily pill at dose levels expected to be efficacious. We plan to conduct dose optimization studies in the second half of the year that are intended to inform our registration enabling studies. Obesity represents a growing area of patient need and it's a key area of focus for Pfizer's R&D programs. We believe these study results, along with learnings from our previous Phase 2 studies and data that we have accumulated from 1,400 participating patients, leave us well positioned to execute on a registration-enabling study as we work to deliver a competitive product in a rapidly growing market. When we hosted our Oncology Innovation Day in February, we shared the pipeline milestones that would mark our success over the next year and we are already demonstrating progress. A highlight was our strong presence at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting last month, which was anchored by three positive Phase 3 readouts. Follow-up data from the Phase 3 CROWN study of Lorbrena in patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer showed 60% of patients on Lorbrena who are living beyond five years without disease progression. This strengthens Lorbrena's position as an emerging standard of care in the frontline setting. Data from the Phase 3 ECHELON-3 study of Adcetris in combination with lenalidomide and rituximab demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And, data from Phase 3 study evaluating an additional Adcetris combination regimen showed progression-free data in patients with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphoma, while significantly reducing side effects compared to a standard of care regimen used in Europe in this setting. We have advanced our oncology clinical pipeline in 2024 with Phase 3 studies for sigvotatug vedotin, our integrin beta 6-directed ADC; atirmociclib, our selective CDK4 inhibitor; Elrexfio in the second-line setting in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; and mevrometostat, our EZH2 inhibitor, which we are now moving to Phase 3 and anticipate enrollment beginning in August. We will continue working toward our 2030 oncology strategy goals of delivering eight or more blockbuster medicines and doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines. We also have momentum with our vaccine programs. In our next-gen PCV candidate, for example, we have advanced to a Phase 2 program in both adults and pediatrics, based on encouraging clinical data that we received that highlight our industry-leading capabilities in expanding valency beyond 20 serotypes. We expect to be highly competitive by offering the largest serotype coverage in a single vaccine while strategically addressing the persistent medical need across invasive disease, antibiotic resistance and challenging serotypes. In RSV with Abrysvo, I am pleased to report that yesterday we received an approval for Abrysvo's Act-O-Vial presentation in the United States, a presentation which offers advantages such as a never-frozen, unique system enabling one-step reconstitution highly valued by pharmacists. Additionally, we have submitted for label expansion in both the United States and Europe for adults 18 to 59. In our malignant hematology programs, we are also driving progress. Last week, we reported positive results from a Phase 3 study demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our one-time gene therapy candidate for people with hemophilia A. As we continue to advance our pipeline, additional milestones include expected updates later this year about our COVID/flu combination vaccine, marstacimab, for hemophilia A and B, and ponsegromab, for Cachexia, a wasting disorder associated with chronic disease. Now I'll turn to our strength with commercial execution of our business. Another strategic area of focus is protecting and growing our core product portfolios while we also maximize the performance of our new products. We continue to see encouraging progress with our team's execution. Nurtec is an example where we are rising to meet substantial demand. This product delivered strong results in the quarter with 44% year-over-year global operational revenue growth. We see additional opportunities for expanding share in both acute and prevention usage, as well as growth opportunities in international markets where we are making progress with our launches. I hope Alexandre will be able to touch based on this during the Q&A Session. Now, I will touch on a few additional product portfolio highlights. In the pediatric segment, Prevnar 20 continues to demonstrate strong performance that reinforces a leadership position among pneumococcal vaccines in the United States where market share grew to greater than 80%. During the quarter, the performance of Abrysvo was in line with seasonal vaccine trends. We remain confident in our full-year performance as we believe we are well positioned to help address the expected rising need later in the year among older adults at increased risk for RSV. Litfulo is a product we launched last year and we're encouraged by strong demand. Approximately one out of every two new patients on advanced systemic therapies is receiving a Litfulo prescription, a position we expect to grow as we continue focusing on execution. We view Velsipity as a promising and much-needed option for adults with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis. We're encouraged by recently securing preferred coverage for Velsipity at our first large national payer. We expect to see the impact of this in 2025 and now we're working to build on this with additional payers. When we consider core products in our portfolio, we are also seeing positive impact from strong execution. The Vyndaqel family of products offers a good example of how we are making a difference for patients and our business. We are accelerating growth by working with physicians to drive improvement in identifying appropriate patients with ATTR-cardiomyopathy and helping patients to access and stay on the therapy once it is prescribed. With strong growth through the second quarter, we believe there is additional opportunity to identify more patients who could benefit from our Vyndaqel products because of high unmet need. It is estimated that nearly half of those with this progressive and deadly disease have yet to be diagnosed. Eliquis was another significant contributor to our results as we continued to claim greater share in a growing oral anticoagulant market. Now, let me briefly wrap up. First, I'd like to thank my more than 80,000 colleagues for the dedication they are showing each day to our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients' lives. We are confident in our business. With our focus and execution, along with our deep expertise in driving innovation and advancing our pipeline, we believe we are on track to deliver on our full-year financial commitments in 2024. I walked through our progress with three of our strategic priorities and now Dave will cover our work to expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value as he discusses our financial performance and outlook. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Yes. Thank you, Dave. Let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. Mikael, you want to address it very quickly. Yes. Thank you very much. Let's move to the next question. Perfect question for Dave. Thank you, Dave. Operator, the next question, please. Yes. Thank you, Terence, and very good questions. RSV, why don't Aamir and then Alexandre speak about the Royalty? And then Chris, you covered alerts. And Alexandre, what about international markets. Good news for file and let's go to Chris now. Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question please. Thank you. Great questions. Aamir and then Alexandre. Thank you. Alexandre? And I believe, Alexandre, that this year, we got almost 55 countries registered Nurtec in international markets, 55 markets on [indiscernible] 15 received already reimbursement, and we are waiting for the remaining 40 to receive reimbursement. Let's move to the next question. Mikael? Thank you very much, Mikael. Next question, please. Thanks, Chris. I will ask Aamir to speak a little bit about the Eliquis specifically. And then, Dave, can you cover the general impact of IRA? Thank you, Dave. Operator, next question, please. Yes. Mikael, why don't you give a little bit on the obesity candidates other than danu? And what about the cost reduction? Thank you. Operator, next question please. Aamir about maternal RSV. And international anything to add? And about the competitiveness of Padcev, Chris? Thank you, Chris. Next question, please. Aamir, what about this, the stocking? And in the international market? Thank you. And Chris? Thank you. We are very excited about it. Next question, please. Mikael? Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please. Thank you. Operator, next question. I don't know. They have the decision making, so they will do what they think. I can't comment on that. I know have discussed that thing, but \u2013 so I will emphasize once more, if CMS says that that was a big win for them against the pharma industry, what I would say it was the whole law of IRA. It is a very big loss for innovation and for the crown jewel of American industry, which is the Life Science Technology business. But it is what it is. It is the law of the land. And we are doing our best to make sure that we minimize any impact, particularly in the future, because for now, as Dave said, we were probably in the next few years, the NPV [ph] that are at stake for us, It's quite small because most, we were fortunate not to have up to four products selected only one. Next question, please. Aamir, why don't you take the first one? Thank you. And again, in the interest of time, Steve, for the RSV, when we provided $2 billion was in the frame of a pipeline asset. What is the key potential annually? We don't give once the products are registered, typically projections not even for the next year, not for the peak years, but what I would say if everything \u2013 if anything, things have become more promising since the time that we gave this $2 billions, because we were all surprised how much the medical community and the recommended authorities are putting emphasis on the disease. So that's my comment. Sorry I couldn't be more specific to you. Next question, please. Yes. For the next-gen, I'll make it easy. We announced that we entered into Phase 2 studies, both in pediatric, and so one can calculate, you can't comment how long we take because these are event-driven studies, particularly when you go into Phase 3, right. So we don't know how long that will take, but. And we don't comment at this stage, but let's go to Paxlovid and explain the dynamics, Aamir. Yes. Thank you, Aamir. Thank you, Dave. And also Vamil, I realized that I misspoke before when I said that it is event-driven, the next-gen. It is not. It's immunogenicity. Also, I can offer another point for you to try to estimate the timelines that next year, we expect to have the regulatory discussions about how the program should look like, and then we will form better understanding when we can have the Phase 3 readout. Next question, please. And I think the last question, operator last question, please. We cannot hear the operator. Sorry for this technical problem. The technician just told me to wait a moment, please. Otherwise we will stop the call here. Aamir? Yes. And when it comes to, IP right now, it's very difficult, once the product is getting generic, to be able to fight with a new molecule unless you have substantial differentiation. And, VYNDAQEL has tremendous efficacy. So we do not expect that the market will continue being as big, particularly for us, after we see generics entering into it. So thank you for the question. So I want to make some just closing remarks that we had a very strong first half of the year, and we are confident that we will deliver on our full year financial commitments in 2024. We are driving progress with solid execution as we continue to serve patients and grow our business, execution makes the difference. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and we hope you have a wonderful."

            "content": "Yes. We are, as Albert said in the oral remarks, doing the dose optimization for PK and formulation to select potential doses for pending data progression to Phase 3 and we expect to share that first quarter. Thank you. As you know, we have worked over several decades in optimizing how to expand the number of serotypes while maintaining strong immune responses for as many as possible. We have not disclosed yet how many serotypes we have. We have recently pursued expansion of that next-gen into Phase 2 of both pediatric and adult and look forward to adult data to come quite soon, which will allow us to move swiftly in that indication. We have made significant improvement on existing and new serotypes through new technologies. And that is a deep capability. So it's not just about having the highest number of serotypes. It's really to show the consistency and the data before you can draw any conclusion. So we remain very confident in our ability to defend our leadership position and continue to expand it through these new technology tool bots. Yes Yes. As you heard from Albert, danu is the more advanced drug with a large tolerability, safety and efficacy experience. As always, in our projects, we have additional drugs in the same class. It's in Phase 1, performing as expected. We have another mechanism of action that would combine with Oral GLP [ph] such as danu later in development of life cycle. And we have other mechanisms to protect part in kidney that could also be part of an internal medicine, larger cardiometabolic franchise. Thank you. Yes, for your questions, we'll likely present a comprehensive data set on PK after collecting all the data from the two studies, but we are looking into what's the best way to sharing it timely. We have some of the most aggressive timelines when we agree a protocol with regulatory agency and pending data. And as Albert has said, if that becomes the case that we move forward pending data, you can bet that like every Pfizer program, it will be very fast."

            "name": "Chris Boshoff",
            "content": "Thank you for the question on Elrexfio. As you saw, we recently demonstrated the updated median overall survival data for Elrexfio in the intent to treat 123 patient population in the late-line disease, where we see an overall survival of 24.3 months, which we believe is differentiated. Elrexfio also have a differentiated profile in terms of the safety profile as well as other factors including subcutaneous administration, flat non-weight-based dosing and a flexible dosing regimen overall. We've now launched in 16 countries and in fact in Japan, we were the first to launch and it's early days. We've also recently got approval in the EU and UK. In the U.S., total demand is plus 40% growth sequentially quarter-over-quarter and early next year or during 2025, you'll see the readouts for the bigger opportunities, which is MagnetisMM-5 in the double-class exposed population and then later in the year, potentially MagnetisMM-32, which is post-CD38. So overall, we remain confident that we've got a very differentiated molecule that could become a backbone across the continuum of care for multiple myeloma. Thank you for the question. We're very pleased that in this quarter, as you've seen, we printed just shy of $400 million for Padcev with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 15%. Based on the claims data through the end of May, we are seeing U.S. first-line share increasing into the low 50% range. And as you know, the next opportunity is obviously in muscle invasive bladder cancer with two ongoing studies being conducted by Merck, which can expand the population to an additional 28,000 addressable patients. So overall, we are seeing that Padcev with pembrolizumab is becoming entrenched in the first-line setting as the standard of care and future studies, including future nectin-targeted medicines, radioligands or ADCs will likely have to do studies against Padcev plus pembrolizumab in the first-line setting, which could be challenging. Thank you very much for the question on KAT6. KAT6 is a first in category medicine. We're very proud that this medicine was conceptualized and discovered at our laboratories in Ohio. As you've seen with the most recent data, objective response rate over 35% durable responses and well tolerated. We therefore plan to initiate a Phase 3 program over the next six months, and you'll learn more about that. But thank you for the question. We're also excited about KAT6."

            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we close out the first half of the year, I'm very pleased by our second quarter results. We continue our relentless focus on execution, demonstrating our ability to both protect and grow our core brands while also continuing to advance our science-led transformation by investing in key TAs to build durable franchises. Our initiatives to right size OpEx and reduce cost of goods will result in a more efficient organization, setting the stage for strong capital returns and long-term improved shareholder value enabling our commitment to both maintain and to grow our dividend. This morning, I will briefly review our second quarter results including some one-time items, touch on our capital allocation priorities, and wrap up with an update on our 2024 financial guidance, our key priorities, and expectations for the remainder of this year. Turning first to Q2 performance versus the same period last year; let's walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, reflecting operational growth of 3%. Our revenue and cash flow continue to be impacted by the post-pandemic COVID environment on a global basis but to a much lesser extent than prior quarters. Looking at the business excluding our COVID products, we demonstrated strong commercial execution across the enterprise, resulting in 14% operational revenue growth in the quarter. Performance was positively impacted by our continued focus on key products and geographies; refined allocation of commercial field resources globally; and further optimization of our marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance was our acquired products from Seagen as well as Nurtec, alongside in-line products Vyndaqel, Eliquis and Xtandi. As expected, dampening our growth in the quarter were Xeljanz and Ibrance. Adjusted Gross Margin for the second quarter was 79%, compared to 76% last year, and was primarily the result of favorable sales mix from our non-COVID products, as well as continued strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be a focus for the company over the next few years as we execute on our recently announced Manufacturing Optimization Program. This new program and together with our cost realignment program is focused on returning the company to pre-pandemic operating margins on a mix adjusted basis excluding Comirnaty. Phase 1 of the Manufacturing Optimization Program, which focuses on operational efficiencies, is well underway now. This first phase is expected to deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027, some of which is anticipated to be realized beginning in 2025. Total Adjusted operating expenses increased by 5% operationally to $6.3 billion and include spending from our legacy Seagen business. Looking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses increased 8% driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched as well as acquired products. Adjusted R&D expenses increased 2% operationally driven primarily by increased spending related to the acquisition of Seagen, partially offset by lower spending primarily the result of our cost realignment program. Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.01 and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60. Unique one-time items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results, this quarter include a $1.3 billion charge related to our Manufacturing Optimization Program primarily for severance, and a $230 million charge for IPR&D asset impairment and other related costs associated with the discontinuation of our DMD program. Additionally, we expect to record a charge of approximately $400 million in the third quarter of 2024 after a decision was made in July to sell one of our facilities as a result of the discontinuation of the DMD effort. Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return; and finally making value enhancing share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. In the first half of 2024, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend; invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D; and as expected, the completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to de-levering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25 times remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have paid down approximately $2.25 billion in maturing debt, including $1 billion in May of outstanding notes. And though we did not monetize any Haleon shares in Q2, we expect to resume monetization of our 23% Haleon stake in the future. I would also note that once our Haleon ownership is less than 20%, our accounting will transition from recording equity income and will no longer be included in our adjusted results. This change is factored into our long-term financial planning and as well as our guidance. As we've previously stated previously, we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels this year and particularly during the first half of 2024, due to the timing of certain payments and one-time expenses. We expect heavily weighting of revenues to the fourth quarter as our business has become more seasonal in nature with the potential that a high level of cash collections may carry over into Q1 of 2025. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective remains to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. Now, let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of the year. We entered 2024 focused on delivering on our financial commitments as well as commercial performance. With a successful first half now complete, we believe it is appropriate to update our full year earnings outlook to reflect our strong business performance. I'll remind you that our revised guidance assumes the seasonal cadence of our product portfolio, and that we expect Paxlovid results to trend with infection rates. With that said, we are raising our full year revenue range by $1 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30. We now expect revenues in the range of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion and operational revenue growth excluding COVID products is projected to be 9% to 11%. COVID product revenues are now expected to be $8.5 billion for the year; $5 billion for Comirnaty and $3.5 billion for Paxlovid. Our guidance for adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D remains unchanged while our effective tax rate on adjusted income is now expected to be approximately 13%; and, lastly, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.65 primarily reflecting the increase to the top line and the revised tax rate among other items. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing cost. In closing, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost-realignment program by the end of this year. This improvement in our cost base alongside our new initiatives focused on manufacturing is expected to put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns. Additionally, our continued focus on execution and our recent investments have positioned the company for continued success moving forward. This quarter's results are a testament to the performance of our commercial business and our prudent approach to improving our cost base. Though we've had a strong first half, we do not take lightly the continued focus needed to deliver in the second half considering the seasonality of our respiratory products. We are clearly striving to bring about improved performance on both the top and bottom lines through focus, execution and delivering on our near-term commercial and financial goals. 2024 is clearly a foundation year for Pfizer. Our achievements to date sets the stage for generating compelling shareholder value. Through our science-led transformation, we will methodically build off this base and with breakthroughs and innovation driving growth in the back half of the decade. And with that, I'd now like to turn it back over to Albert to start our Q&A. Yes. So Mohit, just a couple of things. As you recall in my prepared remarks, we are focused on actually launched our manufacturing optimization program, the result of which will begin to yield results in 2025 and to generate over $1.5 billion in savings by 2027. As we think about margin expansion, just given the guidance that I provided for the balance of this year, it would imply that margin \u2013 gross margin rates would actually improve versus the low-70s color that we've given previously to probably mid-70s at this point in time. We do expect that all these investments, both our cost realignment program and our investments from a manufacturing optimization program are all designed to improve operating margins to get us back to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. Yes. And then I would just add to that, as we look at IRA across our platform, first, I think we were very fortunate Pfizer that we had one product selected. And secondly, if you look at the remaining products that are likely to be \u2013 that could potentially be selected, they are nearing the end of their patent protection life. So if you think about it from a net present value perspective, the impact on Pfizer is somewhat muted as you think about it economically. I will say this is a piece of legislation that clearly is harmful for supporting research and development in the sector. So we're hopeful that this could be changed in the future, but we will continue to actively manage our way through this. So let me just anchor us on a few facts here. First, the cost reduction effort that we currently have initiated is Phase 1 of a multiple-phase program. So this $1.5 billion savings is only a part of \u2013 or a piece of the story. We will tell more of the story as we define the program more specifically so you get more clarity on that. Secondly, if you look at the $1.5 billion cost improvement effort, and you think about that on our cost of goods sold platform, where it's probably closer to $16 billion versus $15 billion, this is at anchor point. Chris. Given that, for the interest of time let me tell you about Daniel. We have said it multiple times that is going to be PK data right now. We have done with Daniel 1,400 pace, so we feel very comfortable about the profile, we know the product. Right now the question is if we have a formulation that will allow us to take this product into Phase 3 registration enabling studies. We made an announcement because we feel that what we saw from the first round of testing multiple formulations, we felt encouraged that we have several that can deliver and one, but it was the preferred one and it is the one, but because it was the best of all, and now we are going to test it. Also we can speculate if tolerability will be better or not because of once a day compares to twice a day because we don't have the data. But as whis [ph], I said in my prepared remarks for DANUBE, the profile that the DANUBE right now has based on the 1400 patients that we have seen is very competitive both on tolerability and efficacy. With whatever we have seen from others in the oral space so far. And in terms of timing, right now with everything we know we are the only one with 2b data on an oral GLP-1 after, of course, Lilly. So right now for everything we know, we should be the second after Lilly if DANUBE progressed into registration enabling studies. Now let's go to RSV, Aamir. And just real quickly, as you think about the guidance, I think your question was, was this, what was driving our improvement and guidance? This was one of many factors because our core business in general is doing quite well and our cost management programs are really taking hold. So this is one of multiple factors that drove that $0.30 raise."

            "content": "Hey, Terence, it's Aamir. For Abrysvo, I think we are very well positioned going into the fall season in the U.S. for three main reasons. One is contracting. So we've significantly strengthened our contracting position. Many of those decisions were confirmed shortly after the June ACIP and are set to take effect in August, commensurate with the beginning of the season. The second is the ACIP guidance itself, with a recommendation for a single dose for all adults over 75 and those 60 to 74 that are at increased risk. We think that is just clear and strengthens the directive for those who are eligible for a vaccine. And then thirdly, is just Abrysvo itself. We've got great data, including two seasons of durable efficacy data. As Albert alluded to earlier, we have both our current needle free reconstitution kit that is never required to be frozen or thawed, as well as our new active biosystem, which offers many advantages and including 80% storage efficiency, so there's good options for customers. And I will also remind you that there's many healthcare providers and pharmacies that prefer simplifying their vaccine management by having one vaccine for both older adults and maternal, which only a Abrysvo can offer. So the combination of contracting, the ACIP guidance and the value proposition of Abrysvo positions as well in the U.S. Alex, on Nurtec in the U.S., I think there are a number of things that we've done in the first half of the year to strengthen our demand. So we revamp all of our consumer activation efforts. We sharpened the clinical value proposition and how we communicated that, including, but not only limited to the fact that we have an indication for treatment and prevention. We also realigned our field forces to ensure that we're really maximizing activation of both primary care and neurologist providers. And then we made a lot of efforts through the co-pay support and other means to just reduce friction in patients actually getting access to Nurtec once a script is written. And so what you see this quarter for us is a combination of all of those things starting to take effect. So Nurtec TRx was up 28% over the prior year. Revenues were up close to 39% in the U.S. We maintain leadership from a TRx and NRx perspective at 49% and 48% share, respectively. And there were 9,000 new Nurtec writers. So that's about 85% of all new CGRP writers. So as we look forward, we continue to see strength in Nurtec demand. We'll continue to manage the gross to net dynamics of that business, but we are optimistic about where we take it from here. Chris, as you noted, BMS led the discussions with CMS on Eliquis maximum fair price because they are the NDA holder, and they shared their perspective on that process during their earnings call last week. Honestly, we don't have much to add to what they said. We share their view that we have the ability to navigate the impact of IRA on Eliquis. And Eliquis will be an important drug in our portfolio for the foreseeable future. Sure, Kripa. So thanks for the question. I think let me start by just underscoring the interest that we see on maternal vaccination. So when you talk to OB/GYNs, there's a clear preference that they have to vaccinate during pregnancy. And similarly, you hear the same from pregnant mothers. Greater than 60% prefer vaccination versus vaccinating the baby, maternal vaccination. So our launch on maternal did exceed our expectations. So we saw uptake rates through the end of January with about 11% of eligible mothers taking the vaccine. And that is significantly higher than other maternal immunization at the same point in the life cycle. I think key Tdap was less than 2% at the same time. So the other thing I will note is it does require education, as you know. And last year's maternal ACIP recommendation occurred just after the RSV maternal vaccination season began. So this season, we have the benefit of using the first half of the year to invest in that education of both HCPs as well as pregnant women, and we look forward to the season ahead. Yes. So on Prevnar, I'll just provide context on the U.S. performance dynamics. So the change year-over-year is predominantly a result of lower adult demand due to shrinkage of the opportunity size in that market. And the quarter-to-quarter change that you see is a function of the CDC order timing for pediatric vaccines, which tends to be quite lumpy as well as some of the adult vaccination dynamics of both shrinkage and seasonality. And I think it's important to continue to think about these two segments very differently in the U.S. So with pediatrics, as Albert had mentioned in his remarks, we exited Q2 with a share of 81%, which is up 71% in August. And then the adult market continues to behave differently in the U.S. in that it is contracting because there are just fewer eligible 65-plus adults and a more difficult-to-activate younger population. And that's the same population that Merck's V116 will be launching into. So Chris, what I would say is we are only in the second season now of a expanding market, right. So you had the first season last year, this year with the ACIP recommendation. As I mentioned earlier, we think that that provides clarity and it strengthens the need for those identified in the recommendation to get a vaccine. And we've had another six months plus of opportunity to educate HCPs as well as consumers, and we see growing relevancy and urgency of people to vaccinate. So we do think that the opportunity set expands. Sure. So Steve, on VYNDA maybe what's going on now and then what's to come with competition. So VYNDA is continuing to grow at a very healthy clip. This is a result of multiple factors, a very important one of which is we focused on expanding our HCP base that we're targeting as well as really investing in diagnosing and identifying patients. Diagnosis remains the biggest unmet need in this condition because there's almost half of patients that are still undiagnosed. So we do see a lot of growth opportunity in VYNDA. Now for this year it may not continue as the same clip that we've seen in Q1 and Q2, because we had a big bolus of enrollment patients in the beginning of the year, partially as a result of some of the IRA reforms, and the incremental diagnoses become harder and harder to find. But we do expect continued growth with VYNDAQEL. As far as competition, there's still a lot that needs to be understood exactly about the competitors, their data, their profile, what actions they're going to take. But what I will say is that we obviously welcome more treatment options for patients, but there's a lot that we're very confident in with VYNDA. There's a body of clinical evidence that includes five-year follow-up clinical trial data, and real world evidence including statistically significant mortality and CV hospitalization data that is in our label, as well as quality of life benefits that we think continue to position VYNDA well. But of course, with competition coming in, we will take that into consideration and provide further guidance as things evolve. Yes. So for Pax in the U.S., you pointed to the momentum in Q1, which I'll remind you was a combination of both the true-up as well as ongoing utilization that was very high given the wave of COVID infection. What happened then is in the first half of Q2 infections were low. And the very clear trend that we see with Paxlovid is when there is a COVID infection wave, we have healthy Paxlovid utilization. So starting in May, all the way through June, there was increased COVID infection waves and our Paxlovid utilization followed. So we had about 35,000 treatment courses a week in April and May, peaking to about 100,000 in June. So we have seen continued utilization. Now it is trickier for the wholesalers and end customers to manage utilization around the disease. That's a little bit unpredictable. So we did enter Q2 with higher than normal inventory levels, but the wave of utilization that we've seen in Q2 has helped normalize those inventory levels. And all of this dynamic combined with the fact that we've built a commercial model to successfully get Paxlovid to those who need it, including very healthy coverage with commercial payers, 90% of pharmacies across the U.S. already participating in our USG PAP program, and a simplified model for delivering that PAP program to patients when there is a COVID infection wave. We're confident about Paxlovid utilization. Hey, Evan. So, a bit as I mentioned earlier, yes, we do expect to see continued growth momentum for VYNDA in the back half of this year and going forward for the reasons I described earlier. It may not be at the level that we saw in the first half of the year because of the Q1 bolus of patients, but the combination of what we're doing in terms of physician expansion, investment in driving diagnosis, and tailwinds from IRA reform do give us conviction around short term VYNDAQEL growth."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. \nFrancesca DeMartino: Good morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. \n I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D; Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. \n Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning and our disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Albert. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. In the first quarter, we had a solid start to the year, and we are cautiously optimistic about what we will achieve in 2024. I'm pleased and appreciate how our Pfizer colleagues are executing with discipline as they focus on the patients and others we serve. This helped us deliver a strong performance during the quarter in our non-COVID product portfolio, drive progress towards our oncology leadership, advance our pipeline and continue to strengthen our business. \n Today, we will discuss highlights from the quarter and provide updates about how we are continuing to make progress with the 5 strategic priorities we served with you at the start of the year. We are proud of the positive impact we achieved around the world with our deep capabilities and global scale. Through the first 3 months of the year, we reached more than 119 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. We will continue to build on Pfizer's 175-year history of driving medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs as we maximize the opportunities in front of us. \n Our confidence in the year ahead comes from our focus on executing the strategic priorities that we believe will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. The priorities are: achieve world-class oncology leadership, deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximize performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. In the first quarter, we made notable progress with each one, and I will share some highlights. \n Many of you joined us in our Oncology Innovation Day in February, and I hope you found it to be a valuable opportunity to see how we are well positioned to achieve world-class oncology leadership. We are pleased with the excellence we have been able to achieve in both integration and commercial execution. \n With a strong mix of Pfizer and Seagen colleagues in the newly combined team, we believe we have one of the most experienced and talented groups of oncology leaders in the industry. We\u2019're also already seeing the benefit of strong commercial execution with our newly cross-trained sales and field medical teams. \n In the first quarter of 2024, our oncology revenues grew 19% operationally over the same quarter a year ago, driven in part by: the acquisition of the 4 in-line products from legacy Seagen\u2014, \u2014and then particularly, the strong ongoing launch of PADCEV in front-line locally advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer, regardless of cisplatin eligibility, following FDA approval based on the groundbreaking EV-302 data. \n We have an increased demand for XTANDI, which continues to be a backbone therapy across the prostate cancer treatment continuum. And we have continued growth from LORBRENA, which could emerge as the potential first-line standard of care in ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. \n Earlier this week, we also announced the full FDA approval of TIVDAK to treat recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. TIVDAK is the first antibody-drug conjugate to have positive overall survival data for patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. \n Going forward, we are guided by a strategy focusing on our greatest opportunities to make a difference for patients with cancer. With the power of our deep expertise, broad and diverse portfolio and global scale, we are confident we are well on our way toward our 2030 goals of doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines; increasing the number of blockbuster medicines in our portfolio from 5 today to 8 or more; and driving an anticipated tenfold increase in the proportion of revenue from biologics. \n This is important because it brings the potential to provide more durable revenue based on several factors, including Inflation Reduction Act considerations and the greater challenges of copying complex biologics. We will look forward to sharing continued updates with you on our progress in accelerating oncology breakthroughs.\n Now I\u2019'll turn to our progress with delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation. In Oncology, during the quarter, we had three pivotal Phase III study starts, including the first Phase III trial for our selective CDK4 inhibitor, atirmociclib; our integrin-beta-6-directed ADC, sigvotatug vedotin\u2014; and the fourth Phase III trial for ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma. \n At the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, we will present data spanning each of our tumor areas of focus and core scientific modalities, including new 5-year progression-free survival data for LORBRENA, Phase III data for ADCETRIS in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and additional developments from across our deep and diverse pipelines. \n We are also driving continued execution beyond Oncology, with a sharpened focus on key value drivers expected to build potential multi-billion-dollar product portfolios. Through the first quarter, we are on track with delivering on our anticipated milestones and have important updates in both our growing Respiratory and Hematology portfolios. \n With ABRYSVO, we believe we have the opportunity to further expand what is currently the broadest approved range of patients for the RSV vaccine, including adults 60 years and older and infants from birth to 6 months via maternal immunization. We recently reported positive results from the Phase III MONeT trial, evaluating ABRYSVO in adults aged 18 to 59 at increased risk for RSV disease. \n The trial met its primary endpoints, and we intend to submit these data to regulatory agencies. We believe ABRYSVO has the potential to become the first and only RSV vaccine for adults 18 years and older. \n Hematology is another priority area. With the progress of recent and near-term milestones, we are confident that we could establish a potential multi-billion-dollar product portfolio across hemophilia and sickle cell disease. We recently received the first U.S. FDA gene therapy approval for Pfizer with FDA approval for BEQVEZ, a one-time gene therapy for adults with hemophilia B. \n This program builds upon our growing presence in hemophilia. We expect an FDA decision before year end for marstacimab, which has the potential to become the first once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for the hemophilia B market, and the first treatment delivered as a flat dose for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. \n Moving to sickle cell. We recently started the Phase III study of osivelotor, our potentially best-in-class next-generation hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor. We are committed to addressing the underserved needs of the sickle cell disease community, and we are leveraging our capabilities for potential breakthroughs for these patients. \n Now, I'll turn to our strategic priority of maximizing performance of our new products. While it may take a year to realize the full benefit of the changes we put in place, as we speak, to bring a more efficient structure to our commercial operations, we are pleased by the impact we are already seeing from our sharpened focus and Pfizer colleagues embracing our high-performance culture. \n Earlier, I mentioned the momentum of our Oncology products. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and Pfizer International Commercial organizations are also moving ahead in driving progress with growth in their respective markets. We have several potential key growth drivers for this year and into year 2025. \n With ABRYSVO, we\u2019 are very pleased with the positive data in the 18 to 59 age group that differentiates our product, and we a\u2019re encouraged by our opportunities to continue increasing overall RSV market growth and market share.\n Another example of -- is our enthusiasm for the potential of NURTEC to help the more than one billion people living with migraine worldwide. With oral CGRP penetration leaving room for potential significant growth, we will continue to\n Focus on reducing access barriers for health care professionals and patients, as well as on education through direct-to-consumer marketing.  \n With OXBRYTA, we will continue to educate health care professionals and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic and proactive treatment. VELSIPITY is coming off its annual (sic) [initial] launch, and we are focused on ensuring patient access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n And I will mention LITFULO. We will work toward continuing to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate patients with alopecia areata and further unlock access to LITFULO. Additionally, we continue to protect and grow our core brands and key blockbusters, including PREVNAR, VYNDAQEL and ELIQUIS. \n In a moment, Dave will provide updates about how we\u2019re also making progress with two other strategic priorities, expanding margins by realigning our cost base and allocating capital to enhance shareholder value. When we consider what we achieved in the first quarter, along with our continued progress in executing our 5 strategic priorities, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. \n We are continuing to focus on commercial execution, protecting and growing our products and driving strong starts with new commercial launches. With the progress we are making in advancing our cost-realignment program, as well as our confidence in the underlying strength in our business and our continued execution, we have raised our outlook for 2024 adjusted earnings per share by $0.10. \n We have confidence in our company. With some of the most experienced and talented colleagues in the industry, we have demonstrated many times before that we are very good at execution, and we expect to continue delivering life-changing medicines for hundreds of millions of patients globally and meaningful value for our shareholders.\n Now, I wi\u2019ll turn it over to Dave to discuss the financial performance during the quarter as well as our progress in strengthening our business and enhancing shareholder value. Dave? \nDavid Denton: Thank you, Albert, and good morning. As we continue to navigate a challenging post-COVID environment, I\u2019'm pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start. We are protecting and growing our core brands while investing in building a more effective organization. Our relentless focus on execution is positioning Pfizer to improve shareholder returns.\n This morning, I'll briefly review the highlights of our first quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I\u2019ll wrap up by outlining our 2024 financial guidance as well as our key priorities for the remainder of this year. \n Turning to the first quarter, let me walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, reflecting an operational decline of $3.5 billion or 19% versus last year. As you know, our business continues to be negatively impacted by a declining COVID environment on a global basis. To that end, we expect our COVID products will continue to have an outsized effect on both our top line and our bottom line throughout this year. \n However, I do want to point out that we expect our COVID products will continue to be contributors to revenues and cash flows for the foreseeable future. Strong commercial execution across the enterprise drove 11% operational revenue growth in the quarter when you exclude COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. \n Performance was positively impacted by our renewed focus on key products and markets, refined allocation of commercial field resources globally and further alignment of marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance were our acquired products from Seagen, alongside in-line products such as VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS and ABRYSVO. \n Dampening our growth in the quarter was the expected lower global demand for IBRANCE and SULPERAZON, driven largely by lower demand in China in the first quarter of 2024 versus last year.\n Adjusted Gross Margin for the first quarter improved by 530 basis points to 79.6% versus Q1 of last year. This improvement was driven by 3 factors. First were lower sales volume of COMIRNATY resulting in favorable sales mix. Second, in the quarter, we recorded a product return adjustment for PAXLOVID associated with our U.S. government contract, and I\u2019ll touch upon that in just a moment.\n And finally, we executed strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be an important focus for the company going forward. Total Adjusted operating expenses increased modestly by 1% to $5.9 billion compared to Q1 of last year despite adding expenses associated with the acquired Seagen business. \n This disciplined cost control puts us squarely on track to delivering on our $4 billion net savings commitment by the end of the year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 3% operationally in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired or launched products, partially offset by a decrease in expenses for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. \n Consistent with our strategy, we are prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns while supporting growth from our pipeline. For the quarter, adjusted R&D Expenses were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 1% operationally versus LY. The slight decline was driven primarily by a lower spending resulting from our cost realignment program and lower spending on certain vaccines program, largely offset by increased investments mainly to develop certain assets acquired from Seagen. \n Q1 reported diluted earnings per share were $0.55. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.82, which exceeded our expectations due to favorable gross margin performance as well as strong cost management across the enterprise. \n As I stated earlier, during the quarter, we recorded a favorable product return adjustment associated with our U.S. government contract for PAXLOVID. Recall that during Q4 of last year, we estimated the U.S. government credit for PAXLOVID was $3.5 billion. \n Earlier this year, the U.S. government announced that the EUA labeled product was no longer authorized for CUs and the agreed-upon return period had now expired. Given those facts, we can now finalize the total value of the U.S. government credit. This resulted in a favorable adjustment to revenues of $771 million for PAXLOVID and contributed $0.11 to the company's earnings per share. \n Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. \n During the first quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and, as expected, business development activity was minimal in the quarter. We are committed to delivering our capital structure with a gross leverage target of 3.25x, which we expect to achieve over time. \n In support of that goal, during the quarter, we paid down approximately $1.25 billion of maturing debt. And in May, we will pay down another $1 billion of outstanding notes. And importantly, during the quarter, we began to monetize our Haleon stake through an initial sale of $3.5 billion, which reduced our equity position in the company from 32% to approximately 23%. \n Looking ahead to the next couple of quarters, I'd like to point out that we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels, largely due to the timing of certain payments. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective is to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. \n Now let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of this year. As we entered 2024, the company was highly focused on delivering on its financial commitments, and our performance in Q1 demonstrates that we are off to a solid start. With that objective in mind and the fact that it's still early in the year, we are modestly updating the earnings outlook for this year. \n We are raising our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10 to a new range of $2.15 to $2.35. Looking ahead, this increase takes into consideration both our improving line of sight to our cost savings targets and continued strength in our underlying business. As a reminder, our EPS guidance also includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs. \n While the PAXLOVID revenue return adjustment moves us to the upper end of the revenue guidance range, our top line revenue expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect revenues in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion. In addition, even though COMIRNATY revenues continue to perform consistent with our plan, it is important to remember that we expect approximately 90% of our sales to occur in the second half of the year, mostly in Q4, given the seasonal nature of these products. \n Lastly, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of the year. Improving our cost base will put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns as we move forward. \n As you know, over the past 2 years, the company has made significant investments to drive growth in the back half of the decade, and we remain encouraged by the long-term growth outlook for Pfizer. 2024 is clearly a year of focus, execution and delivering on our near-term financial commitments. The foundation that we establish this year sets the stage to deliver on our commitment to enhance shareholder value, both this year and through the end of the decade. \n And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert as we begin our Q&A session. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, David. Now let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. \nLouise Chen: I had a question for you on your RSV vaccine sales. Just curious what drove the downtick versus the fourth quarter. It looks like GSK had a similar downtick. And then how do you think about potential competition coming into the market for vaccines and treatments? Does that impact your future growth projections for this franchise? \nAlbert Bourla: I think, Aamir, that's a question for you, then maybe Alexandre also, you can add because now we started already to register and approve the product in international markets. Aamir? \nAamir Malik: Louise, thanks for the question. So it very much appears like the RSV vaccination market is following a seasonal trend, so you expect the dynamics in Q4 versus Q1 to be different. In Q1, what we saw for the market is for older adults, it certainly attenuated over the course of the quarter. So there was a peak in the second week of January, and then a steady week-by-week decline since then. \n Now in terms of the dynamics for our business and ABRYSVO, our performance was in line with what we expected. We think this will follow a seasonal trend. And we think we're very well positioned for the fall season for several reasons. \n One is we're progressing our retail contracting. Second is we have a real strength in the nonretail channel. You referred to GSK. They reported their revenues. When you look at the mix of U.S. revenues as reported, it's about a 60-40 mix. Our retail share is lower than that, but our nonretail share is much higher. And that portion of our business really doubled between Q4 and Q1 from about 9% to 17%. \n And I think that just speaks to our strength in doctors' offices and relationships we have with organized customers. And I'll also note that later this year, if approved, we will have a new presentation of ACT-O-VIAL, which demonstrates ease of administration, and also our clinical data, which Albert referred to in his remarks, for label expansion for ABRYSVO for 18- to 59-year-olds as well as -- that are at risk as well as durable efficacy through 2 seasons. I think the combination of these commercial efforts as well as potential label expansion really position us well for a fall season. \nAlbert Bourla: Okay. Thank you, Aamir. Now, Alexandre? \nAlexandre de Germay: Yes. So Louise, thanks for the questions. On the international front, we actually made great progress on ABRYSVO. As you know, we got approval in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the U.K. And since then, we've been working with the health authority and the experts to provide medical evidence and health care system benefits associated with the protection against lower respiratory tract infection, as with RSV, and through immunizations of maternal after the immunization of all the others. So we're making good progress. \n And actually, we have already received the recommendation in the U.K., in Australia, in Norway, and we are progressing and waiting some recommendations from the vaccine technical committee in many other European markets. We also had good progress from a regulatory standpoint because it was a milestone with the approval of older adults and MI during the maternal immunization in Japan in the first quarter as well as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. \n So overall, they don't yet translate into financials because it takes time to get to the approval to get VTC and to get funding for those campaigns, but we see significant opportunity that we can address unmet medical need in the international. Just to give you 1 example, in Europe, for instance, half of the hospitalization due to respiratory tract infection in the first year of life were caused by RSV. \n So there is definitely a great opportunity. And the majority of those hospitalizations occurred for the first 3 months of age. And as you know, ABRYSVO is the only maternal vaccine that help protect infants from lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV immunization from birth through to 6 months. So we see a great opportunity. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Alexandre. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Maybe just a 2 part from me. Just wondering if you can comment at all about potential impact in 2025 from the Part D redesign. We've heard a couple of other companies already comment here. And then one on the pipeline. Can you give us any update on danuglipron and your plans more broadly in obesity? \nAlbert Bourla: Yes, thank you. Can you [indiscernible]? Let me take that one so to clear the way. It's not new. We don't have news on danu. Everything is as we have discussed before, so we are waiting around mid-year to get the totality of the data that relates to the once-a-day formulation. And then based on the data and everything else, we will make decision for future plans. So we'll speak about them when we have more to say. However, now let's go to Aamir about the Part D redesign in 2025. Did you expect them? \nAamir Malik: Sure. Terence, thanks for the question. And as you can imagine, there's many moving parts to Part D redesign. I think relevant to our business, I think it's important to first note that as part of what already went into place with the redesign, there is no cost sharing imposed on vaccines. So that, given our significant vaccines portfolio, is a positive. And then, obviously, over the course of '24 and '25, there's other dynamics with out-of-pocket cost caps, which create better access for patients, and that is helpful to volumes, and we're starting to see that in '24 in some parts of our business, including on VYNDA. \n And then there's things to come, including a change in that cap as well as patient smoothing. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously, there's also changes in how costs are shared between plans, manufacturers, government and patients. So how all of that gets implemented, we're tracking that very closely. We're not offering any specific guidance in terms of direct dollar impact on our business in 2025 because there's still a lot to come on this. And when we are ready to do that, we certainly will. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. \nAkash Tewari: On tafamidis, really strong quarter, but I wanted to ask on patent life. Given we've seen the EU patent office write-down multiple invalidity oppositions and on the U.S. side, it looks like defendants are conceding infringement. How should we think about IP for this product? Why shouldn't this patent fit out to 2025? And then number two, really strong quarter for PADCEV and you do have the pending TIVDAK launch in first-line cervical. Is there any possibility we could see CGM become accretive to Pfizer earnings by next year? \nAlbert Bourla: That's very good questions. Why don't we go first to you, Dave, to speak a little bit about is doing very well. If you expect that can become accretive earlier. Also, I would like to hear some comments from Chris about the progress of the portfolio, and then Doug can comment on the IP situation, our customers. \nDavid Denton: Yes. So just maybe on Seagen from a financial perspective, obviously, clearly a very solid quarter and a very solid start to the year. I think we're not changing our expectations, both short term and long term for Seagen, but I think we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward. So probably nothing to update financially other than our continued commitment to the financial metrics that we've already established. And again, we're probably cautiously optimistic on the trends that we're seeing underlying that business at this point in time. \nAlbert Bourla: You want to make some comments also, Chris, about the performance of the Seagen business? \nChris Boshoff: Yes, I think just to add to what Dave has said, it's early days for as he pointed out, the 302, the data was -- we just launched early this year. We've already seen 164% year-on-year pro forma growth. It's early but we're very pleased that we've got NCCN Guidelines Category 1. We've got a New England Journal publication. We've got uptake in both academic and community settings. In fact, 70% of the current accounts on the community. And we're looking forward now because I think we're well set for the future in the muscle invasive bladder cancer setting and those 2 studies that we'll read out late in 2025, '26, '27. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Chris. Doug, what about the situation with the IP disputes? \nDouglas Lankler: Yes. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX currently has U.S. patent exclusivity, excuse me, through the end of this year. But we have a patent pending patent term extension, which would take it out to December of 2028. And we may be filing additional requests for patent term extensions while that is pending. In major European markets, our patents expire in November of 2026. And in Japan, the patent expires in 2026, but there's regulatory exclusivity through March of 2029 for cardiomyopathy. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Doug. Thank you, Akash. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: I want to touch on gross margin. Obviously, a nice improvement in this quarter. And I believe, back in December, you had said, for the full year, it would be around 70%. Do you expect that we could actually see a better gross margin for the full year, given kind of the benefit we've seen? Or are there some other puts and takes that we should be aware of? \nDavid Denton: Yes, so this is Dave. We're always looking to improve our performance from both a gross margin and operating performance perspective. So I'll say we'll continue to focus on that. Obviously, as you know, there's 3 things that improved our gross margin rate in the quarter. Some of those are temporal. Some of those are more permanent. I think what is encouraging within our gross margin performance is the fact that our cost control element across our manufacturing platform was really strong. We expect that to be -- continue to be a focus.\n But keep in mind that our COMIRNATY volume is very back half weighted. COMIRNATY, as you know, carries because of our profit share carries a very low gross margin rate. So that mix will reverse itself in the back half of the year, compressing and putting pressure on our gross margin rate. So you should expect that dynamic to occur as that product plays itself out through 2024. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. \nVamil Divan: Congratulations on the quarter. The 2 products I want to just kind of touch on in terms of the sort of newer growth drivers. So one is NURTEC, which came in a little bit lighter than we expected. Obviously, the first quarter there tends to be impacted a lot by gross to net. I'm just trying to understand if you can just give a little more detail on what the dynamics in the quarter and any sort of change to your sort of expectation of that product outlook.\n And then the second one on the myeloma side, ELREXFIO. Just noticed in your slide presentation that used to be listed under the sort of key growth drivers in prior quarters. This year, on Slide 9, when your sort of key growth drivers is no longer listed there. So I'm just curious if -- it looks like it was an intentional change. I'm just curious, sort of what drove the decision to move that from the group of key growth drivers? \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Vamil. Aamir, NURTEC, and then Chris, myeloma. \nAamir Malik: Thanks for the question, Vamil. So I'm happy to talk a little bit about NURTEC. We'd like to accelerate the momentum of NURTEC, and we're taking several steps to do that. For the quarter itself, what we're encouraged by is the demand and the volumes that we saw. And then on the flip side, as you already alluded to, the performance in the quarter was impacted by gross to net. \n So on demand, a few points to just keep in mind. NURTEC continued its market leadership within the class with a 49% TRx share, and that was up 28% from Q1 of last year. Secondly, NBRx share, which we keep a very close eye on, that volume, as a whole, hit its high point since we closed the Biohaven acquisition at the end of '22. \n So that was up versus last year, but also, importantly, up versus Q4 of '23. And there were about 11,000 new NURTEC writers in Q1, and this is 90% of all the new writers within the oral CGRP class. So there's a lot about the volume and the demand that we're encouraged by.\n Now on gross to net, there were 3 issues this quarter. One is you typically tend to see this dynamic in the first quarter of every year. We saw that last year, too, just given the benefit design dynamics. Secondly, we did have some payer mix issues between government and commercial channels this quarter. And then finally, there was an unfavorable onetime prior period adjustment to our GTNs in Q1.\n Your question about the rest of the year, for NURTEC, we expect continued growth. We've talked about the fact -- the fundamentals in terms of untreated patients and undertreated patients remain strong. We also think that some of the gross to net that I described is going to be temporal and will slowly abate over the course of the rest of the year. And then we have made a number of changes in our commercial execution in terms of what we're doing with patient engagement and focusing our field force resources on physician awareness in a different way and also working to reduce friction for patient access. So overall, we do expect continued growth from NURTEC in the balance of '24. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Chris, about ELREXFIO? \nChris Boshoff: Thank you, Albert. So the reason Albert didn't list ELREXFIO as a major growth driver, just to remind, so he pointed out  LORBRENA, XTANDI and PADCEV as the immediate biggest growth drivers for Oncology. But we're absolutely confident that ELREXFIO will become, over the next couple of months and years, a major driver for Oncology. \n Just a reminder, we've seen very promising efficacy data in highly refractory patient populations with deep and durable responses. And we've reported the longest reported median progressive-free survival in the recurrent relapsed/refractory setting of 17.2 months. Now of course, recognizing there's no definitive conclusion as there's no head-to-head studies. We're currently encouraged by what we've seen with the uptake, with the build of new patient starts as we have planned. And we remain very optimistic with the future from the current indication as well as from the future indications. \n And a reminder that we have 4 ongoing registrational studies in the next 12 months. The first Phase III study would read out multiple -- in the MM5 study. We've also recently received J-code for access, and we're smoothing the reimbursement process and continue to gain favorable positions on various pathways, and in some, the most favorable pathways. We're looking forward to update you very soon on more things from ELREXFIO. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. And maybe Alexandre, you have anything to add about the product in international markets? \nAlexandre de Germay: Yes. On ELREXFIO, we actually have -- it's progressing very nicely because, as you know, we got approval in Europe in December of 2023 and in the U.K. in January, and in Japan in March 2024. So we are now moving into reimbursement, ABRYSVO. And we've got early access, considering the clinical profile, the exceptional clinical profile of the product. So that's why we got, in some market, early access, and that's why we started sales in the first quarter. \n But we are very satisfied by that. We could close the time-to-market gap versus competitor. And in some cases, like in Japan, we actually indeed became first-in-class approved. So then we are moving into registrational -- reimbursement discussion and introduction of the product later in the year. \nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Overall, in most international markets, there is a gap between the approval and the access round. But because of the profile of the product, we saw early access, which is basically something that happens on an exceptional base if the product is unique. But some countries, before they approve the price, they are allowing you to have access to your own price and that they may be adjusted. So -- but there's a very good signs for this product. We are really feeling very bullish when we see the clinical profile and the opinions of the key opinion leaders. \n Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. \nDavid Risinger: Yes. So how many questions am I allowed to ask? \nAlbert Bourla: You, Dave, you don't have a limit. \nDavid Risinger: Okay. So I have -- I'll keep it to 2. So first, regarding the company's cost structure. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether it bottomed out in the first quarter or if there are additional cost reductions ahead after March 30 such that the cost structure of the company is coming down after the first quarter. And then second, with respect to VYNDAQEL. I appreciate the comments in response to the question earlier, but I'm just trying to get a little bit better understanding of how to think about it.\n So there was a comment about patent term extension potentially applying beyond December of '28. So if Pfizer is successful, what would the date be instead of December '28 for the U.S.? And then for the EU, the comment was November of '26. But I've heard that there was a positive EU patent development, and I'm trying to understand what that would extend the EU to. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much, Dave. So Dave Denton, please, you take the cost structure. \nDavid Denton: Yes. First, as you well know, rightsizing our cost structure is incredibly important for us from -- as we think of forward for margin expansion and improving our financial returns. As we look through Q1 and through the balance of the year, keep in mind that the cost changes that we've made in the U.S. are largely complete. Obviously, in ex U.S., some of those changes lag, but you will see changes in the cost structure ex U.S. for the balance of the year.\n Those are probably not quite as large as we look forward compared to what has already happened at this point. But I would just say that this will be a constant focus for us as we think about cost and margin enhancements going forward. This is a -- now we're on a continual cycle of thinking about how we invest and what is the appropriate cost structure in support of our revenue objectives for this business going forward. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Dave. And Doug, can you please clarify a few things about VYNDAQEL to Dave Risinger's question? \nDouglas Lankler: Sure. Just to be clear, Dave, we shouldn't think beyond December 2028 on VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX. So we've got a patent term extension that is filed and is pending. And all I was saying was that, in addition to that patent term extension, which would take it out to December 2028 that we filed and is pending, we may file additional patent term extensions, again, though, just to take it out to December 2028. I hope that's clear. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you for clarifying that. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Trung Huynh with UBS. \nTrung Huynh: Trung Huynh from UBS. One on the ACIP meeting coming up and just a clarification on the guide, if I may. So on ACIP in June, what's your expectation on the recommendation for the 50 to 59 population? Could this be a shared clinical decision like the 60-plus? Would you think this is going to be risk-based? Is there any chance you can get the 18 to 59 data on the agenda for this meeting? \n And just on the guide, a clarification here on the credit for the quarter bec you've kept your $3 billion guide for PAX. I appreciate the comment you're now going to be at the upper end of guide. But on PAX, do you expect to have $770 million less PAX sales than you imagined at the start of the year, given that you updated your EPS guide. Or was this expected? \nDavid Denton: Well, maybe I'll take that first. From a guide perspective, I would not -- we obviously did not expect this final adjustment. It was an estimate that we did at the end of the year. We're now finalizing the adjustment based on the returns that we've seen, and it is now complete. I would say that, as we look forward for the full year, both for PAXLOVID and for the full year of all of our products, we're cautiously optimistic about where we are.\n I think PAXLOVID started off from a very solid utilization. And keep in mind that product will trend consistent with infection rates across the globe. And we're still cautiously optimistic that we will achieve our objective, and we do not expect anything less than our original expectation at this point in time. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, David. And Mikael, on the ACIP meetings and the June-October recommendations, et cetera. \nMikael Dolsten: Yes. First, to punctuate, good to hear you interested in our RSV vaccine. We have a lot of positive and informative data that's coming in 18 to 59. We have already been out sharing a robust outcome for that. And filing is imminent to happen in U.S. FDA. We also have data coming on second season, full second season and data so far that have been available show robust and probably best-in-class profile for us. And you heard AAMIR mention, we also have new delivery format. So there is a lot of positive things happening to further strengthen ABRYSVO.\n For a formal decision on recommendation, ACIP normally wait until a product is FDA approved. We don't know exactly when FDA will potentially approve. We think, clearly, given this unique age range that it can happen to be meaningful for the fall, but that needs to be, of course, pending FDA's views. But we will certainly be very open to share data from several of these new important data sets that could help ACIP to understand the planning of the various RSV products. And we think that would be very helpful for ACIP as Abrysvo data set are robust and, in some sense, unique in a positive way. Thank you. \nAlbert Bourla: Internal a couple of comments for those -- both of these questions. On the ACIP, we always don't speak for ACIP. So it's not appropriate, do ll do what they can to do. Of course, typically, as we say, they wait to see FDA approvals, and we hope that they will ask us to present the data in June, but it's something that we don't know. What we know is that whatever they decide, whenever they decide we have prepared our marketing and commercial plans in the U.S., as we do, of course, in other countries so that we can maximize the approvals or the recommendations or the data that we have. So that's 1 thing. \n The other thing, David explained that we are cautiously optimistic, of course, about -- that comes through the entire line of guidance that we gave. We are cautious in our revenues, cautious about margins. And of course, we improved, again, cautiously that we think the EPS. You need to see all of that in the context of who have been there last year with a big misalignment between what we were expecting to come for COVID and eventually what came. \n And that it is something that makes us to be double cautious when we speak about projections. We know credibility is extremely important for us. So everything we say, we feel rocket solid, but we will achieve. And we don't say anything more than that, we prefer to achieve rather than b safe. So that as a context to all the guidance that we have provided this time. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. \nUmer Raffat: A couple of financial focused questions, if I may. First, on gross margin. Dave, I remember last time you mentioned 2 specific things: in-sourcing of recently acquired products as well as new launches as being a drag on gross margin. Considering both those things were presumably baked into 1Q, and 1Q looked more like what the historic margin build would have implied, wouldn't that suggest full year margin is tracking meaningfully north of the full year guidance of 70%? Or were there one-offs like some inventory work down from recent acquisitions in 1Q that helped it? \n And secondly, and maybe this is for you and Albert both. Is there a potential for a significant monetization for some of your excess manufacturing capacity from over the years, be it fill finish or beyond, just considering what the broader environment is and some of the questions on dividend? \nAlbert Bourla: I think David can take both of them. Dave? \nDavid Denton: Yes. On the gross margin side, as I said, there is a couple of things that impacted favorably our performance in Q1. The items that you listed of both new product launches and in-sourcing, the in-sourcing is probably a longer-term implication to us because those don't happen in an immediate quarter. So as you think about Seagen, it's probably a multiyear phenomenon that we have here. But I don't think that was an outsized impact to that. \n And obviously, the new launches, we plan for those to be compressing our gross margin rates, of which they did. I think we're off to a very solid start. But keep in mind what I said earlier, in the back half of the year, COMIRNATY sales will begin to ramp up. They compress our gross margin rate fairly significantly, given the partner contribution and payment that we have to our partners. So I would expect that to dampen our gross margin performance in the back half of the year.\n Umer, as you well know, we're focused on overdelivery, if we can. So I think we will do everything we can to continue to improve our performance there. \n And then finally, as we think about the balance sheet, first and foremost, I just want to reiterate that our #1 priority from a capital allocation perspective is both supporting and growing our dividend over time, and that is not at risk. Secondly, yes, we always look at the assets that we have across our platform and understand what's the best way to capitalize on those assets, and some of that may be monetizing some of that. Some of that may be operating more effectively. So everything is on the table from that perspective. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, David. And although your answer was very complete, I will just reiterate something that you said because it seems like that some people, they want to hear it again. The dividend is a sacred cow for us. Dividend, it is secured, and we will continue our policy on dividend as we have promised repeating. And we don't have to monetize things to be able to see that. The reason why we are looking at all our assets is because we want to maximize return on the capital. \n And of course, we will see opportunities. I don't know when it makes sense, like the ones that we described, there is serious now issue with the sterile capacity that people are looking to acquire. We will look at everything, but it's not that we are looking right now on this or that because we need to support the dividend, all really to support the delevering opportunities or need to support the investments in the business, right? We can do that without doing any much. Thank you very much. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. \nGeoffrey Meacham: Just have 2 quick ones. The first is now that Seagen has been fully integrated, and you'll see some commercial leverage from the deal, would you expect to see more of a gradual impact on the PADCEV and et cetera, trajectories looking out a few years? Or could you have a more near-term inflection? And then the second question, Dave or Albert, the capital allocation commitment to the dividend is super clear. What we view on Slide 12 as dividend and deleveraging as the 2 highest priorities, or is bolt-on BD still in the mix for this year or next? \nAlbert Bourla: Yes. Let's go to Chris to understand the commercial impact on Seagen and how that will take time. \nChris Boshoff: Thank you very much. So as you know, we had a number of months planning prior to close to ensure we had a seamless integration. And we completed cross-training of our commercial field force teams in January, especially for breast cancer, between TUKYSA and IBRANCE, but also hematology between ADCETRIS and ELREXFIO. And we should start seeing that further playing out now over the coming months. \n As we've mentioned, we're obviously very pleased that there's been tremendous colleague retention, so we haven't had an issue with colleague retention, both from the legacy Pfizer and the legacy Seagen organization as we build a new business.\n We expect PADCEV to continue to do well. There's significant enthusiasm from health care providers, from patients, from patient advocacy groups because of the groundbreaking data, double the overall survival. So we are confident that we'll continue to see PADCEV growth. \n We've also seen TUKYSA, for instance, 21% year-over-year pro forma basis growth. And in fact, the last quarter was the highest performance of TUKYSA. So overall, great confidence, and we started the first new Phase III study with an NME from the Seagen portfolio with a secret attack. and we hope to update you on other Phase III studies from the legacy Seagen portfolio. \nAlbert Bourla: From my perspective, yes, of course, we have invested so much into this business, and we think that this is an area that we can make a huge difference to the world. I'm monitoring that very closely. I'm very impressed actually, I would say, nicely surprised on the positive side how well both on the Pfizer impact of day 1 plus 1 equals 3 rather than 2. But already, we'll start seeing it both in the research organization because we are putting now a lot of Phase III on starts. \n And you don't see but I have high visibility on what's going on in earlier stages where we put a lot of stuff in the clinic. And then also in the commercial, that you can see now stabilization for IBRANCE on the Pfizer side, and then high growth of the seeds and assets despite the fact that, as I said, you should expect a decline in the first 6 months. \n When you have an integration, always, we have a decline. I haven't seen a single integration that we have done, but it didn't face challenges because people are changing territories, people are changing let's say, jobs, marketers are moving around. \n All of that creates, let's say, a disruption here. We can be of -- we have very, very strong growth on both sides. So I'm really, really pleased. Not of course, will take time to see the full benefit. But certainly, under Chris' leadership, and he has formed a terrific team, we are off to a very good start. \n Now Dave, why don't you take or the next question? \nDavid Denton: So as it relates to your question regarding capital allocation, clearly, our first priority, our #1 priority is supporting both the dividend as well as delevering our balance sheet. So that is job 1 from my perspective. As it relates to bolt-on acquisitions, in the near term, you would not expect us to do much there. We are -- that is a lower priority in the near term until we get ourselves. I hope that helps. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Srikripa Devarakonda with Truist. \nSrikripa Devarakonda: Congrats on the progress. I have a question about your breast cancer franchise from the IBRANCE perspective. You have pivotal data from the estrogen receptor, PROTAC, the collaboration with partnership with Arvinas expected later this year. One is, what are your expectations for these data? And how important are these data for you to make decisions around either continuing or initiating combo Phase III trials, like whether it's CDK4/6 combo or CDK4 combo or both of them? \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Chris? \nChris Boshoff: Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Just a reminder to point out with IBRANCE that over 773,000 patients have now been treated globally with IBRANCE. So  it is currently still the CDK4/6 leader. We're very excited about 2 programs: vepdegestrant, which we believe to be best-in-class next-generation receptor degrader and also atimociclib, next-generation CDK4 specific inhibitor. \n For, as you point out, we'll get the data later this year for VERITAC-2, but we are planning additional studies at ROTH. You can expect to see first-line studies, both first-line study with atimociclib and standard of care endocrine therapy as well as a termocyclib-plus brand. [indiscernible] as you've seen in a heavily pretreated population, we've seen an overall response rate of 32% with medium progressive survival of 8.1 months. We're therefore highly encouraged.\n I'm definitely very encouraged by the safety profile and we see more continuous dosing, very good compliance and more complete coverage of CDK4, and that's why we're confident to accelerate CDK4 into a registration strategy and the first study has already started, as you know, the second-line study. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Chris. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Carter Gould with Barclays. \nCarter L. Gould: I wanted to ask a follow-up as I think it's important, and I fully respect the focus on '24 and Albert's commentary on conservatism around guidance. But to come back to the IRA impact for thinking about '25. When do you think you'll be in a better position to comment a little bit on you're contracting discussions are underway pretty late in the earnings season here, and most of your peers have already made comments and your Part D exposure isn't exactly a surprise. So any color there on time line would be helpful. And I guess for David, you talked about the operating margin improvement being sort of a multiyear process. Is there a risk that the IRA sort of presents a little bit of a hiccup to that in '25? \nAlbert Bourla: Aamir, do you have any comments on that? \nAamir Malik: Sure. So Carter, I think you heard us describe the dynamics. And later this year, we will have more clarity on what that means. And so we can certainly share that. I think there's also a specific question that comes up often about Eliquis, so let me just address that now because we are clearly in a live negotiation on that. \n BMS, our alliance partner, is leading that process. You've heard them describe, and we also described that there will be transparency around the outcome of that for impact in '26 in the September time frame. And so at that point, we'll be in a position to share more. \nDavid Denton: Yes. And I guess, as it relates to 2025 and the impact of the IRA from a margin expansion perspective, I would say, without giving any specifics on that is, as we look forward, we obviously run multiple scenarios around how our business might perform. And in those scenarios, we would model different impacts to the IRA because it's still unclear because it's still a lot of moving parts, specifically as we just spoke about. Under those scenarios, we will work hard to offset any implication we might have through improving our cost structure. \nAlbert Bourla: And I want on the IRA, and also, we said something, but clearly, in 2025, we will have 2 events that are happening, which are -- we will have to contribute to -- as a pharmaceutical industry, so that will put pressure on the pricing, let's say. But also, because of the significant pains in the out-of-pocket dynamics, and which I hope that will be implemented, as the law says, immediately because I'm hearing efforts to try to play with that. \n But if that is the case, which we are certain because that's the law, we will see significant drug uptake, right, for everyone, not for us, of course, for everyone because there is a huge number of abandonment that is happening at the pharmacy level when people are asked to pay this very high out-of-pocket, particularly the first 1 quarter and maybe 2 when they need to exhaust their, let's say, their co-pays or the deductible.\n So that, I think, dynamic, you know that the industry always asks that we contribute to the out-of-pocket payments as long as the patients are paying less because there is a significant benefit for all: for health care system, for the patients, for us. And so I'm not that concerned about that for the industry as a whole. I'm very concerned for the industry as a whole with the mandatory cost reduction. There is no negotiation there. They are just cutting prices, but are occurring for biologics and for more volumes, particularly.\n One good thing for us, it is, first of all, that we have good exposure on vaccines, that they are a part of that, actually, they are benefiting from the IRA because there is no cost sharing. So we can see that in the volumes again. But on the small molecules where we do have exposure, I would say that we were like only 1 product that was selected for '26, we would have 3 or 4, and only 1 was selected. So Eliquis, as Aamir said, we will wait to see. We know, of course, but we can't discuss in the middle of negotiations about anything that's happening. And so we'll see the impact of whatever about this in 2026.\n Then if next year, they bring some of the other products that they've been included and they were not in this year, that will be the IBRANCE of the world, that will be the XTANDIs, those are products that anyway, they are approaching their LOE. So even if they come into the IRA, the MPV risk that we have in place is not that big because really, we cut the price for something, but it will not be for a very lengthy period of time, but will be for smaller than others period of time. This doesn't mean that this is not very bad for the industry and for innovation, and we clearly opposing and he will try whatever we can to defend it. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC. \nRajesh Kumar: First question is you very helpfully provided some color on the gross margin. What are the takes and puts there? If we look at your early 70s guidance and the gross margin you've achieved in Q1, do we see below 70s gross margin some point in some quarter this year? Or you sort of will get to early 70s with throughout the year, maintaining over 70% margin? And then the bit which is quite difficult to work out from the disclosures is, how did the PAXLOVID number impact the gross margin? So any help there so that we can model that right would be much appreciated. \nDavid Denton: Okay. Great. So yes, I think we just gave some color around gross margin being closer to 70% versus closer to 80% when we entered 2024. We are maintaining that color at this point in time. I would say that it's unlikely for our gross margin rate to fall below 70% in any given quarter. But I want to just emphasize the gross margin rate will fluctuate a bit, primarily given the mix of sales, specifically within the vaccine portfolio, which carries a lower gross margin, number one. \n Number two, when you look at our performance for gross margin in Q1, a dominant effect of that versus last year is the mix, the lower sales volume of COMIRNATY in the quarter in Q1 versus last year's Q1. Obviously, the final adjustment of the PAXLOVID reserve actually did also have a onetime positive impact on the gross margin rate in Q1, but that was less of an impact compared to the mix. So I hope that helps. \nAlbert Bourla: And as I want to emphasize that on PAXLOVID, what really makes me pleased it is the underlying demand of the product, right? So it was approximately in the first quarter and in the U.S., 2 million scripts, right? So that's significant. And keep in mind that this was the quarter that we moved from a previous way of go-to-market approach to a commercial model, right? But I had a lot of mines in execution, but we didn't step into any of them. So it was Again, I'm very pleased how Aamir and the U.S. team executed on that. executive. So we have a very small transition with very low [indiscernible] commercial plans. \n For the vast majority of the insured lives and then at the same time, very good execution with thousands of participating, almost 90,000 pharmacies, if I remember Well, of 90% of the is participating into the Medicare part. And that went extremely well. And also I want to remind that the Medicare that goes clearly with different price level because it is through the credit of the U.S. government compared to the commercial plans, that they are at [ 1,000 ], it's a different list price. And that difference exists for this year. Next year, everybody moves to the list price, and of course, the discounts that we give any. Let you over to Case, please. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. \nChris Shibutani: Two questions, if I may. The first on pneumococcal vaccines with Prevnar as well. Last quarter, you provided some commentary about your thoughts on the tone of the markets, particularly for adult being somewhat more mature. And obviously, competition is coming across the different categories, adult and pediatrics. Can you comment about your view, given that performance was relatively strong and how you're preparing for competition?\n The second question I have is on commercial models. There has been some nascent efforts in the industry to go more direct to consumers, for instance, Lilly has direct for their obesity products. Aamir, I'm curious about your thoughts about integrating this type of approach, particularly as I think about certain product categories that you have like migraines and NURTEC, how might this work? Where is Pfizer in terms of exploring these opportunities? \nAlbert Bourla: Aamir? \nAamir Malik: Okay. Chris, thanks for the question. So on Prevnar, you alluded to the commentary we provided around dimensionalizing the market, and I think it's worthwhile just reiterating that. So the adult market continues to contract and that's for 2 reasons. There are increasingly fewer eligible 65-plus adults. And then the 19 to 64 underlying medical conditions, population is obviously more difficult to activate. So that is a dynamic that is true for our business, but it's also true for any competitor that's going to come into the adult vaccine market. So I think that's important to note. \n Now for our overall franchise, we continue to expect growth. We did very nicely in Q1. We saw 6% growth. And the big driver of that is increased uptake as well as market share growth in the pediatric. So pediatrics in Q1 saw a lot of conversion, PCV 13 to 20. And our share exiting Q1 was at 80%, and that was from 71% at the time of launch of PCV 15. So we see good momentum on pediatrics. \n Now back to your question about the adult segment and competition. We're continuing to see very good performance where we are. We have 98% market share. We acknowledge that V116 is coming. And as Albert alluded to earlier, we're not going to speculate on what the regulatory outcomes or recommendations are going to be. But there are a number of things that we can do to defend our business in the adult segment. Firstly, we have a portfolio approach to contracting that we're deploying in the retail setting but also in the nonretail setting. \n And it's also important to note that in the nonretail setting, many organized customers have a preference for workflow management to stock 1 vaccine that satisfies all the current [indiscernible]. So until we know more, I think the best way to defend our share in the adult segment is to continue to do what we're doing. And that's to be laser-focused on maximizing the opportunity that we have in the adult segment, albeit contracting and then continue to drive growth in pediatrics. \n On your second question around consumers, look, engaging and activating consumers is, as you pointed out, a very, very important part of our business. It's true in vaccines. It's true in categories like PAXLOVID and NURTEC, just to name a few examples. And we're always looking at ways to enhance that connection. One example I'll point to is the work that we've done on VAXassist as a mechanism to help consumers determine their vaccine eligibility but also book appointments. And that's a really good example of value that we can bring. And to the extent that we can do more of that, create value for patients as well as for our business in other categories, we'll certainly look to explore that. \nAlbert Bourla: Alexandre, very quickly, anything on PCV in international markets? \nAlexandre de Germay: Yes. No, we had a great quarter. As you know, we grew by 8% operationally. But more importantly, we also have achieved some key milestones. So we got the European approval of pediatric Prevnar 20 in Europe. We also got it approved in Japan, which are very important market in Australia and many others. So this is great because then we want to build on the very successful [ pre nup ] franchise around the world. As you know, we have exclusive NIP standards in [ 130 ] market, and now we're going to be able to build on that.\n Just 1 comment on the adults. We still are in the process of getting VTC recommendation in most of the European markets. But where we got it in Germany and in France, we see a very nice pickup. And why? Because they extended the population covered by the Prevnar 20 outlook. For instance, in Germany, gave us 18 to 59 population at risk and all-comers, 60 and above. And since that and we got this remediation in February, we get very nice pickup in utilization in Germany, and we are about to launch in France as we speak. So in adults, as well, we see a great potential of growth. \nAlbert Bourla: It's a very nice cadence of approval and recommendation. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: Maybe a question for Dave. Just wanted to understand the cadence of margin improvement as you are embarking on the cost management journey throughout the year because I mean, you had a really high EPS because of the onetime item, but if you think about margin profile over the year, how should we think about it? I understand fourth quarter could be impacted with COMIRNATY revenues. And then when we get into 2025, should we think about better leverage or do you think there could be more opportunity to  [indiscernible] expenses in '25 as well? \nDavid Denton: Yes, thank you for the question. I would say that without giving -- since we don't guide to quarterly expectations for gross margin, I would just say that the focus that we have around improving our cost of goods sold is a multiyear journey. And these costs that we are working to improve take time to adjust and to further implement ways to be more effective and efficient in this infrastructure.\n So I wouldn't think of that having a significant impact on 2024 but more -- if it would, it would be late 2024 but more '25 and '26. But more to come. As we know more and as we develop our plans more specifically, we'll be certain to share some specifics around that. P \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Just 2 ones for me here. Just on Abrysvo, just really quickly following up on the earlier commentary. Can you just update us on where we are in terms of contracting efforts and progress in the retail channel, just addressing some of the market share issues you highlighted last year? I guess my specific question is, do you have line of sight on contracting at this point? Or is that still something that's going to evolve as the year progresses?\n And then the second quick 1 was just on VYNDAQEL. Obviously very strong numbers. Maybe just a quick update in terms of where we are with penetration in that market. And where do we -- how much higher can this go? Just how much more of a growth runway is there for that drug? \nAlbert Bourla: Aamir? \nAamir Malik: Thanks, Chris. So on Abrysvo, as I said, we're progressing our contracting conversations so we'll have more to share on that as we do later. And in terms of your question on VYNDA, VYNDA had a really strong quarter. We were up 96% year-over-year, but importantly, also 41% over last quarter. When you look at the drivers, I think there's a few things. Some of that is temporal. So there were some purchasing patterns with wholesaler and specialty pharmacies.\n And we also made a lot of efforts towards the end of last year to ensure that the re-enrollment process for patients was very smooth at the beginning of this year. So all of that leads to a little bit of a Q1 bolus. But importantly at the heart of it, part of our strong performance on VYNDA is that the fundamentals around diagnosis and demand are really strong. So we saw a 33% quarter-over-quarter increase in new patient starts.\n And diagnosis rates over the last several years, we had talked about getting into the 30% to 50% range. We're approaching the top end of that. And there is still significant opportunity to identify more patients. That's the biggest unmet need, and that's where we're concentrating our commercial efforts going forward. So we do think that we will sustain this momentum, probably not at the same rate that we saw in Q1 but we will continue to perform well with VYNDA. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Alexandre, anything to add? \nAlexandre de Germay: Yes, very quickly. On the international front, we also had a very strong quarter because we saw a 28% operational growth but a 43% volume growth, which is comparable to what we see in the U.S. Exactly as Aamir said, there is still opportunity because we basically have established VYNDAQEL as the standard of care. And we've worked with the health care professional to establish robust infrastructure so that we can screen, diagnose, and treat faster.\n And the reality is we still have opportunity to grow because, yes, in markets like France, we are talking 50%, but in other like Italy, we are around 30%, Japan, 28%. So there is still opportunity to grow and increase rates. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. Next question. We'll take 2 more questions because we are running out of time. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. \nTimothy Anderson: So it's a busy pipeline readout year. I'm wondering, Mikael, can you just point to perhaps the 1 or 2 bigger upcoming readouts that excite you the most, where your confidence is high as that could be value creating? So I'm not looking for a description of everything reading out. Just maybe 1 or 2 that excites you the most. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you. Mikael, excite us all. \nMikael Dolsten: Yes, yes. I'm excited about the potential approval for mastozimab for both hemophilia A and B to continue to grow our hematology franchise momentum. [indiscernible] in therapy, we actually today got the equivalent of Breakthrough Designation RMAT based on the early clinical data available, so we are super excited about that. And relatively near term, the readout is coming. COVID/flu combination vaccine, [ 859 ] readout Phase III. And then [indiscernible] pipeline onsegrimab  which I think pending readout has really a breakthrough mechanism. \nAlbert Bourla: Anything from your side, Chris? \nChris Boshoff: Perhaps just to mention again the potential unprecedented new 5-year data for Lorbrenla, which will be presented at ASCO. We could define the growth of Lorbrenla over the next decade. There's 2 other upcoming readouts. \nAlbert Bourla: That's good if we are talking to that [indiscernible] \nChris Boshoff: And there's 2 other readouts that's important to us, the 1 is Breakwater, which is the first-line opportunity in BRAF-positive colorectal cancer. A reminder that, that's up to 12% of colorectal cancer. Particularly poor prognosis so we're looking forward to that readout, Breakwater and then also, as mentioned earlier, VERATEC 2 in second-line ER-positive breast cancer, which can define also the to define the future path for. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. \nSteve Scala: I have 2 questions. In the Pfizer mRNA flu vaccine efficacy trial, was superior efficacy versus approved flu vaccine shown in the 65-plus cohort? This data was to have been presented last year but I don't believe we've ever gotten an update. And then secondly, your interest in obesity more broadly. So the outlook for danuglipron is not good. Bolt-ons don't look likely, but -- and this is just 1 very simple data point. There are post things on pfizer.com for obesity clinical lead position suggesting something is moving forward. So what exactly is moving forward in obesity at Pfizer? \nAlbert Bourla: Yes. On the obesity and Mikael also can comment, of course, together with the mRNA flu vaccine. But I said multiple times that first of all, metabolic is an area that traditionally very big strength in terms of And this is an area that we have the right to win. So we are strong and to keep investing in the whole area because we have the infrastructure. And obesity is a very big part of it, even the of the market. So we will be very active in the obesity with current mechanism of actions and new mechanisms of actions.\n We said repeatedly that we had 3 agents right now in the clinic, and we have multiple on the [indiscernible] but we are progressing. But we don't have anything to say per se right now because on waiting, some data and on the other ones, it's too early to speak about them. So that's why we are not commenting much of that. And we will, let's say, continue being very active in the obesity space and one we're in now. Now what about the mRNA vaccine and anything you want to add also to the obesity line? \nMikael Dolsten: I think you said it so well on obesity. I'll focus on mRNA vaccine and just say that we did share that we had a very robust data for 18 to 59 in the outcome event trial on the first generation flu mRNA platform. We actually further refined that product in order to expand activity against these serotypes although the disease is dominated by A, we saw an opportunity to do that. And that technology is now with the COVID/flu combo vaccine running for 18 to 59 years old and relatively soon, we'll have a readout. We think that's really the near-term opportunity to bring both of the viruses under 1 simple administration approach. For the 65-plus, what you referred to was an early trial with the first generation. We have now moved focus to the second generation and are in preparation of subsequent clinical studies from them. \nAlbert Bourla: Thank you, Mikael. So thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest. That was a very good call. In summary, we are very pleased with the solid start in 2024. We are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. And with our continued progress in executing our 5 priorities, we are confident that we will continue to deliver for our patients, shareholders, and our company. Thank you again for your interest in Pfizer. We hope to have -- utilization in Fermany you have a wonderful day. Thank you. \nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alexandre de Germay",
            "content": "Yes. So Louise, thanks for the questions. On the international front, we actually made great progress on ABRYSVO. As you know, we got approval in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the U.K. And since then, we've been working with the health authority and the experts to provide medical evidence and health care system benefits associated with the protection against lower respiratory tract infection, as with RSV, and through immunizations of maternal after the immunization of all the others. So we're making good progress. \n And actually, we have already received the recommendation in the U.K., in Australia, in Norway, and we are progressing and waiting some recommendations from the vaccine technical committee in many other European markets. We also had good progress from a regulatory standpoint because it was a milestone with the approval of older adults and MI during the maternal immunization in Japan in the first quarter as well as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. \n So overall, they don't yet translate into financials because it takes time to get to the approval to get VTC and to get funding for those campaigns, but we see significant opportunity that we can address unmet medical need in the international. Just to give you 1 example, in Europe, for instance, half of the hospitalization due to respiratory tract infection in the first year of life were caused by RSV. \n So there is definitely a great opportunity. And the majority of those hospitalizations occurred for the first 3 months of age. And as you know, ABRYSVO is the only maternal vaccine that help protect infants from lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV immunization from birth through to 6 months. So we see a great opportunity. Yes. On ELREXFIO, we actually have -- it's progressing very nicely because, as you know, we got approval in Europe in December of 2023 and in the U.K. in January, and in Japan in March 2024. So we are now moving into reimbursement, ABRYSVO. And we've got early access, considering the clinical profile, the exceptional clinical profile of the product. So that's why we got, in some market, early access, and that's why we started sales in the first quarter. \n But we are very satisfied by that. We could close the time-to-market gap versus competitor. And in some cases, like in Japan, we actually indeed became first-in-class approved. So then we are moving into registrational -- reimbursement discussion and introduction of the product later in the year. Yes. No, we had a great quarter. As you know, we grew by 8% operationally. But more importantly, we also have achieved some key milestones. So we got the European approval of pediatric Prevnar 20 in Europe. We also got it approved in Japan, which are very important market in Australia and many others. So this is great because then we want to build on the very successful [ pre nup ] franchise around the world. As you know, we have exclusive NIP standards in [ 130 ] market, and now we're going to be able to build on that.\n Just 1 comment on the adults. We still are in the process of getting VTC recommendation in most of the European markets. But where we got it in Germany and in France, we see a very nice pickup. And why? Because they extended the population covered by the Prevnar 20 outlook. For instance, in Germany, gave us 18 to 59 population at risk and all-comers, 60 and above. And since that and we got this remediation in February, we get very nice pickup in utilization in Germany, and we are about to launch in France as we speak. So in adults, as well, we see a great potential of growth. Yes, very quickly.

            "name": "Albert Bourla",
            "content": "Thank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. In the first quarter, we had a solid start to the year, and we are cautiously optimistic about what we will achieve in 2024. I'm pleased and appreciate how our Pfizer colleagues are executing with discipline as they focus on the patients and others we serve. This helped us deliver a strong performance during the quarter in our non-COVID product portfolio, drive progress towards our oncology leadership, advance our pipeline and continue to strengthen our business. \n Today, we will discuss highlights from the quarter and provide updates about how we are continuing to make progress with the 5 strategic priorities we served with you at the start of the year. We are proud of the positive impact we achieved around the world with our deep capabilities and global scale. Through the first 3 months of the year, we reached more than 119 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. We will continue to build on Pfizer's 175-year history of driving medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs as we maximize the opportunities in front of us. \n Our confidence in the year ahead comes from our focus on executing the strategic priorities that we believe will deliver operational, commercial and financial success across our business. The priorities are: achieve world-class oncology leadership, deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximize performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. In the first quarter, we made notable progress with each one, and I will share some highlights. \n Many of you joined us in our Oncology Innovation Day in February, and I hope you found it to be a valuable opportunity to see how we are well positioned to achieve world-class oncology leadership. We are pleased with the excellence we have been able to achieve in both integration and commercial execution. \n With a strong mix of Pfizer and Seagen colleagues in the newly combined team, we believe we have one of the most experienced and talented groups of oncology leaders in the industry. We''re also already seeing the benefit of strong commercial execution with our newly cross-trained sales and field medical teams. \n In the first quarter of 2024, our oncology revenues grew 19% operationally over the same quarter a year ago, driven in part by: the acquisition of the 4 in-line products from legacy Seagen\u2014, \u2014and then particularly, the strong ongoing launch of PADCEV in front-line locally advanced/metastatic urothelial cancer, regardless of cisplatin eligibility, following FDA approval based on the groundbreaking EV-302 data. \n We have an increased demand for XTANDI, which continues to be a backbone therapy across the prostate cancer treatment continuum. And we have continued growth from LORBRENA, which could emerge as the potential first-line standard of care in ALK-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. \n Earlier this week, we also announced the full FDA approval of TIVDAK to treat recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. TIVDAK is the first antibody-drug conjugate to have positive overall survival data for patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. \n Going forward, we are guided by a strategy focusing on our greatest opportunities to make a difference for patients with cancer. With the power of our deep expertise, broad and diverse portfolio and global scale, we are confident we are well on our way toward our 2030 goals of doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines; increasing the number of blockbuster medicines in our portfolio from 5 today to 8 or more; and driving an anticipated tenfold increase in the proportion of revenue from biologics. \n This is important because it brings the potential to provide more durable revenue based on several factors, including Inflation Reduction Act considerations and the greater challenges of copying complex biologics. We will look forward to sharing continued updates with you on our progress in accelerating oncology breakthroughs.\n Now I''ll turn to our progress with delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation. In Oncology, during the quarter, we had three pivotal Phase III study starts, including the first Phase III trial for our selective CDK4 inhibitor, atirmociclib; our integrin-beta-6-directed ADC, sigvotatug vedotin\u2014; and the fourth Phase III trial for ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma. \n At the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, we will present data spanning each of our tumor areas of focus and core scientific modalities, including new 5-year progression-free survival data for LORBRENA, Phase III data for ADCETRIS in diffuse large B cell lymphoma and additional developments from across our deep and diverse pipelines. \n We are also driving continued execution beyond Oncology, with a sharpened focus on key value drivers expected to build potential multi-billion-dollar product portfolios. Through the first quarter, we are on track with delivering on our anticipated milestones and have important updates in both our growing Respiratory and Hematology portfolios. \n With ABRYSVO, we believe we have the opportunity to further expand what is currently the broadest approved range of patients for the RSV vaccine, including adults 60 years and older and infants from birth to 6 months via maternal immunization. We recently reported positive results from the Phase III MONeT trial, evaluating ABRYSVO in adults aged 18 to 59 at increased risk for RSV disease. \n The trial met its primary endpoints, and we intend to submit these data to regulatory agencies. We believe ABRYSVO has the potential to become the first and only RSV vaccine for adults 18 years and older. \n Hematology is another priority area. With the progress of recent and near-term milestones, we are confident that we could establish a potential multi-billion-dollar product portfolio across hemophilia and sickle cell disease. We recently received the first U.S. FDA gene therapy approval for Pfizer with FDA approval for BEQVEZ, a one-time gene therapy for adults with hemophilia B. \n This program builds upon our growing presence in hemophilia. We expect an FDA decision before year end for marstacimab, which has the potential to become the first once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for the hemophilia B market, and the first treatment delivered as a flat dose for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. \n Moving to sickle cell. We recently started the Phase III study of osivelotor, our potentially best-in-class next-generation hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor. We are committed to addressing the underserved needs of the sickle cell disease community, and we are leveraging our capabilities for potential breakthroughs for these patients. \n Now, I'll turn to our strategic priority of maximizing performance of our new products. While it may take a year to realize the full benefit of the changes we put in place, as we speak, to bring a more efficient structure to our commercial operations, we are pleased by the impact we are already seeing from our sharpened focus and Pfizer colleagues embracing our high-performance culture. \n Earlier, I mentioned the momentum of our Oncology products. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and Pfizer International Commercial organizations are also moving ahead in driving progress with growth in their respective markets. We have several potential key growth drivers for this year and into year 2025. \n With ABRYSVO, we' are very pleased with the positive data in the 18 to 59 age group that differentiates our product, and we a're encouraged by our opportunities to continue increasing overall RSV market growth and market share.\n Another example of -- is our enthusiasm for the potential of NURTEC to help the more than one billion people living with migraine worldwide. With oral CGRP penetration leaving room for potential significant growth, we will continue to\n Focus on reducing access barriers for health care professionals and patients, as well as on education through direct-to-consumer marketing.  \n With OXBRYTA, we will continue to educate health care professionals and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic and proactive treatment. VELSIPITY is coming off its annual (sic) [initial] launch, and we are focused on ensuring patient access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\n And I will mention LITFULO. We will work toward continuing to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate patients with alopecia areata and further unlock access to LITFULO. Additionally, we continue to protect and grow our core brands and key blockbusters, including PREVNAR, VYNDAQEL and ELIQUIS. \n In a moment, Dave will provide updates about how we're also making progress with two other strategic priorities, expanding margins by realigning our cost base and allocating capital to enhance shareholder value. When we consider what we achieved in the first quarter, along with our continued progress in executing our 5 strategic priorities, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. \n We are continuing to focus on commercial execution, protecting and growing our products and driving strong starts with new commercial launches. With the progress we are making in advancing our cost-realignment program, as well as our confidence in the underlying strength in our business and our continued execution, we have raised our outlook for 2024 adjusted earnings per share by $0.10. \n We have confidence in our company. With some of the most experienced and talented colleagues in the industry, we have demonstrated many times before that we are very good at execution, and we expect to continue delivering life-changing medicines for hundreds of millions of patients globally and meaningful value for our shareholders.\n Now, I wi'll turn it over to Dave to discuss the financial performance during the quarter as well as our progress in strengthening our business and enhancing shareholder value. Dave? Thank you, David. Now let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue. I think, Aamir, that's a question for you, then maybe Alexandre also, you can add because now we started already to register and approve the product in international markets. Aamir? Okay. Thank you, Aamir. Now, Alexandre? Thank you, Alexandre. Yes, thank you. Can you [indiscernible]? Let me take that one so to clear the way. It's not new. We don't have news on danu. Everything is as we have discussed before, so we are waiting around mid-year to get the totality of the data that relates to the once-a-day formulation. And then based on the data and everything else, we will make decision for future plans. So we'll speak about them when we have more to say. However, now let's go to Aamir about the Part D redesign in 2025. Did you expect them? That's very good questions. Why don't we go first to you, Dave, to speak a little bit about is doing very well. If you expect that can become accretive earlier. Also, I would like to hear some comments from Chris about the progress of the portfolio, and then Doug can comment on the IP situation, our customers. You want to make some comments also, Chris, about the performance of the Seagen business? Thank you very much, Chris. Doug, what about the situation with the IP disputes? Thank you, Doug. Thank you, Akash. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Vamil. Aamir, NURTEC, and then Chris, myeloma. Thank you. Chris, about ELREXFIO? Thank you, Chris. And maybe Alexandre, you have anything to add about the product in international markets? Yes. Overall, in most international markets, there is a gap between the approval and the access round. But because of the profile of the product, we saw early access, which is basically something that happens on an exceptional base if the product is unique. But some countries, before they approve the price, they are allowing you to have access to your own price and that they may be adjusted. So -- but there's a very good signs for this product. We are really feeling very bullish when we see the clinical profile and the opinions of the key opinion leaders. \n Thank you. You, Dave, you don't have a limit. Thank you very much, Dave. So Dave Denton, please, you take the cost structure. Thank you, Dave. And Doug, can you please clarify a few things about VYNDAQEL to Dave Risinger's question? Thank you for clarifying that. Thank you, David. And Mikael, on the ACIP meetings and the June-October recommendations, et cetera. Internal a couple of comments for those -- both of these questions. On the ACIP, we always don't speak for ACIP. So it's not appropriate, do ll do what they can to do. Of course, typically, as we say, they wait to see FDA approvals, and we hope that they will ask us to present the data in June, but it's something that we don't know. What we know is that whatever they decide, whenever they decide we have prepared our marketing and commercial plans in the U.S., as we do, of course, in other countries so that we can maximize the approvals or the recommendations or the data that we have. So that's 1 thing. \n The other thing, David explained that we are cautiously optimistic, of course, about -- that comes through the entire line of guidance that we gave. We are cautious in our revenues, cautious about margins. And of course, we improved, again, cautiously that we think the EPS. You need to see all of that in the context of who have been there last year with a big misalignment between what we were expecting to come for COVID and eventually what came. \n And that it is something that makes us to be double cautious when we speak about projections. We know credibility is extremely important for us. So everything we say, we feel rocket solid, but we will achieve. And we don't say anything more than that, we prefer to achieve rather than b safe. So that as a context to all the guidance that we have provided this time. I think David can take both of them. Dave? Thank you, David. And although your answer was very complete, I will just reiterate something that you said because it seems like that some people, they want to hear it again. The dividend is a sacred cow for us. Dividend, it is secured, and we will continue our policy on dividend as we have promised repeating. And we don't have to monetize things to be able to see that. The reason why we are looking at all our assets is because we want to maximize return on the capital. \n And of course, we will see opportunities. I don't know when it makes sense, like the ones that we described, there is serious now issue with the sterile capacity that people are looking to acquire. We will look at everything, but it's not that we are looking right now on this or that because we need to support the dividend, all really to support the delevering opportunities or need to support the investments in the business, right? We can do that without doing any much. Thank you very much. Yes. Let's go to Chris to understand the commercial impact on Seagen and how that will take time. From my perspective, yes, of course, we have invested so much into this business, and we think that this is an area that we can make a huge difference to the world. I'm monitoring that very closely. I'm very impressed actually, I would say, nicely surprised on the positive side how well both on the Pfizer impact of day 1 plus 1 equals 3 rather than 2. But already, we'll start seeing it both in the research organization because we are putting now a lot of Phase III on starts. \n And you don't see but I have high visibility on what's going on in earlier stages where we put a lot of stuff in the clinic. And then also in the commercial, that you can see now stabilization for IBRANCE on the Pfizer side, and then high growth of the seeds and assets despite the fact that, as I said, you should expect a decline in the first 6 months. \n When you have an integration, always, we have a decline. I haven't seen a single integration that we have done, but it didn't face challenges because people are changing territories, people are changing let's say, jobs, marketers are moving around. \n All of that creates, let's say, a disruption here. We can be of -- we have very, very strong growth on both sides. So I'm really, really pleased. Not of course, will take time to see the full benefit. But certainly, under Chris' leadership, and he has formed a terrific team, we are off to a very good start. \n Now Dave, why don't you take or the next question? Thank you. Thank you very much. Chris? Thank you, Chris. Aamir, do you have any comments on that? And I want on the IRA, and also, we said something, but clearly, in 2025, we will have 2 events that are happening, which are -- we will have to contribute to -- as a pharmaceutical industry, so that will put pressure on the pricing, let's say. But also, because of the significant pains in the out-of-pocket dynamics, and which I hope that will be implemented, as the law says, immediately because I'm hearing efforts to try to play with that. \n But if that is the case, which we are certain because that's the law, we will see significant drug uptake, right, for everyone, not for us, of course, for everyone because there is a huge number of abandonment that is happening at the pharmacy level when people are asked to pay this very high out-of-pocket, particularly the first 1 quarter and maybe 2 when they need to exhaust their, let's say, their co-pays or the deductible.\n So that, I think, dynamic, you know that the industry always asks that we contribute to the out-of-pocket payments as long as the patients are paying less because there is a significant benefit for all: for health care system, for the patients, for us. And so I'm not that concerned about that for the industry as a whole. I'm very concerned for the industry as a whole with the mandatory cost reduction. There is no negotiation there. They are just cutting prices, but are occurring for biologics and for more volumes, particularly.\n One good thing for us, it is, first of all, that we have good exposure on vaccines, that they are a part of that, actually, they are benefiting from the IRA because there is no cost sharing. So we can see that in the volumes again. But on the small molecules where we do have exposure, I would say that we were like only 1 product that was selected for '26, we would have 3 or 4, and only 1 was selected. So Eliquis, as Aamir said, we will wait to see. We know, of course, but we can't discuss in the middle of negotiations about anything that's happening. And so we'll see the impact of whatever about this in 2026.\n Then if next year, they bring some of the other products that they've been included and they were not in this year, that will be the IBRANCE of the world, that will be the XTANDIs, those are products that anyway, they are approaching their LOE. So even if they come into the IRA, the MPV risk that we have in place is not that big because really, we cut the price for something, but it will not be for a very lengthy period of time, but will be for smaller than others period of time. This doesn't mean that this is not very bad for the industry and for innovation, and we clearly opposing and he will try whatever we can to defend it. And as I want to emphasize that on PAXLOVID, what really makes me pleased it is the underlying demand of the product, right? So it was approximately in the first quarter and in the U.S., 2 million scripts, right? So that's significant. And keep in mind that this was the quarter that we moved from a previous way of go-to-market approach to a commercial model, right? But I had a lot of mines in execution, but we didn't step into any of them. So it was Again, I'm very pleased how Aamir and the U.S. team executed on that. executive. So we have a very small transition with very low [indiscernible] commercial plans. \n For the vast majority of the insured lives and then at the same time, very good execution with thousands of participating, almost 90,000 pharmacies, if I remember Well, of 90% of the is participating into the Medicare part. And that went extremely well. And also I want to remind that the Medicare that goes clearly with different price level because it is through the credit of the U.S. government compared to the commercial plans, that they are at [ 1,000 ], it's a different list price. And that difference exists for this year. Next year, everybody moves to the list price, and of course, the discounts that we give any. Let you over to Case, please. Aamir? Alexandre, very quickly, anything on PCV in international markets? It's a very nice cadence of approval and recommendation. Thank you. Aamir? Thank you. Alexandre, anything to add? Thank you very much. Next question. We'll take 2 more questions because we are running out of time. Thank you. Mikael, excite us all. Anything from your side, Chris? That's good if we are talking to that [indiscernible] Thank you very much. Yes. On the obesity and Mikael also can comment, of course, together with the mRNA flu vaccine. But I said multiple times that first of all, metabolic is an area that traditionally very big strength in terms of And this is an area that we have the right to win. So we are strong and to keep investing in the whole area because we have the infrastructure. And obesity is a very big part of it, even the of the market. So we will be very active in the obesity with current mechanism of actions and new mechanisms of actions.\n We said repeatedly that we had 3 agents right now in the clinic, and we have multiple on the [indiscernible] but we are progressing. But we don't have anything to say per se right now because on waiting, some data and on the other ones, it's too early to speak about them. So that's why we are not commenting much of that. And we will, let's say, continue being very active in the obesity space and one we're in now. Now what about the mRNA vaccine and anything you want to add also to the obesity line? Thank you, Mikael. So thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest. That was a very good call. In summary, we are very pleased with the solid start in 2024. We are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. And with our continued progress in executing our 5 priorities, we are confident that we will continue to deliver for our patients, shareholders, and our company. Thank you again for your interest in Pfizer. We hope to have -- utilization in Fermany you have a wonderful day. Thank you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "David Denton",
            "content": "Thank you, Albert, and good morning. As we continue to navigate a challenging post-COVID environment, I''m pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start. We are protecting and growing our core brands while investing in building a more effective organization. Our relentless focus on execution is positioning Pfizer to improve shareholder returns.\n This morning, I'll briefly review the highlights of our first quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll wrap up by outlining our 2024 financial guidance as well as our key priorities for the remainder of this year. \n Turning to the first quarter, let me walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, reflecting an operational decline of $3.5 billion or 19% versus last year. As you know, our business continues to be negatively impacted by a declining COVID environment on a global basis. To that end, we expect our COVID products will continue to have an outsized effect on both our top line and our bottom line throughout this year. \n However, I do want to point out that we expect our COVID products will continue to be contributors to revenues and cash flows for the foreseeable future. Strong commercial execution across the enterprise drove 11% operational revenue growth in the quarter when you exclude COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. \n Performance was positively impacted by our renewed focus on key products and markets, refined allocation of commercial field resources globally and further alignment of marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance were our acquired products from Seagen, alongside in-line products such as VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS and ABRYSVO. \n Dampening our growth in the quarter was the expected lower global demand for IBRANCE and SULPERAZON, driven largely by lower demand in China in the first quarter of 2024 versus last year.\n Adjusted Gross Margin for the first quarter improved by 530 basis points to 79.6% versus Q1 of last year. This improvement was driven by 3 factors. First were lower sales volume of COMIRNATY resulting in favorable sales mix. Second, in the quarter, we recorded a product return adjustment for PAXLOVID associated with our U.S. government contract, and I'll touch upon that in just a moment.\n And finally, we executed strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be an important focus for the company going forward. Total Adjusted operating expenses increased modestly by 1% to $5.9 billion compared to Q1 of last year despite adding expenses associated with the acquired Seagen business. \n This disciplined cost control puts us squarely on track to delivering on our $4 billion net savings commitment by the end of the year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 3% operationally in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired or launched products, partially offset by a decrease in expenses for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. \n Consistent with our strategy, we are prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns while supporting growth from our pipeline. For the quarter, adjusted R&D Expenses were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 1% operationally versus LY. The slight decline was driven primarily by a lower spending resulting from our cost realignment program and lower spending on certain vaccines program, largely offset by increased investments mainly to develop certain assets acquired from Seagen. \n Q1 reported diluted earnings per share were $0.55. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.82, which exceeded our expectations due to favorable gross margin performance as well as strong cost management across the enterprise. \n As I stated earlier, during the quarter, we recorded a favorable product return adjustment associated with our U.S. government contract for PAXLOVID. Recall that during Q4 of last year, we estimated the U.S. government credit for PAXLOVID was $3.5 billion. \n Earlier this year, the U.S. government announced that the EUA labeled product was no longer authorized for CUs and the agreed-upon return period had now expired. Given those facts, we can now finalize the total value of the U.S. government credit. This resulted in a favorable adjustment to revenues of $771 million for PAXLOVID and contributed $0.11 to the company's earnings per share. \n Now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delevering our balance sheet. \n During the first quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and, as expected, business development activity was minimal in the quarter. We are committed to delivering our capital structure with a gross leverage target of 3.25x, which we expect to achieve over time. \n In support of that goal, during the quarter, we paid down approximately $1.25 billion of maturing debt. And in May, we will pay down another $1 billion of outstanding notes. And importantly, during the quarter, we began to monetize our Haleon stake through an initial sale of $3.5 billion, which reduced our equity position in the company from 32% to approximately 23%. \n Looking ahead to the next couple of quarters, I'd like to point out that we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels, largely due to the timing of certain payments. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective is to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. \n Now let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of this year. As we entered 2024, the company was highly focused on delivering on its financial commitments, and our performance in Q1 demonstrates that we are off to a solid start. With that objective in mind and the fact that it's still early in the year, we are modestly updating the earnings outlook for this year. \n We are raising our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10 to a new range of $2.15 to $2.35. Looking ahead, this increase takes into consideration both our improving line of sight to our cost savings targets and continued strength in our underlying business. As a reminder, our EPS guidance also includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs. \n While the PAXLOVID revenue return adjustment moves us to the upper end of the revenue guidance range, our top line revenue expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect revenues in the range of $58.5 billion to $61.5 billion. In addition, even though COMIRNATY revenues continue to perform consistent with our plan, it is important to remember that we expect approximately 90% of our sales to occur in the second half of the year, mostly in Q4, given the seasonal nature of these products. \n Lastly, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion of net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of the year. Improving our cost base will put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns as we move forward. \n As you know, over the past 2 years, the company has made significant investments to drive growth in the back half of the decade, and we remain encouraged by the long-term growth outlook for Pfizer. 2024 is clearly a year of focus, execution and delivering on our near-term financial commitments. The foundation that we establish this year sets the stage to deliver on our commitment to enhance shareholder value, both this year and through the end of the decade. \n And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert as we begin our Q&A session. Yes. So just maybe on Seagen from a financial perspective, obviously, clearly a very solid quarter and a very solid start to the year. I think we're not changing our expectations, both short term and long term for Seagen, but I think we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward. So probably nothing to update financially other than our continued commitment to the financial metrics that we've already established. And again, we're probably cautiously optimistic on the trends that we're seeing underlying that business at this point in time. Yes, so this is Dave. We're always looking to improve our performance from both a gross margin and operating performance perspective. So I'll say we'll continue to focus on that. Obviously, as you know, there's 3 things that improved our gross margin rate in the quarter. Some of those are temporal. Some of those are more permanent. I think what is encouraging within our gross margin performance is the fact that our cost control element across our manufacturing platform was really strong. We expect that to be -- continue to be a focus.\n But keep in mind that our COMIRNATY volume is very back half weighted. COMIRNATY, as you know, carries because of our profit share carries a very low gross margin rate. So that mix will reverse itself in the back half of the year, compressing and putting pressure on our gross margin rate. So you should expect that dynamic to occur as that product plays itself out through 2024. Yes. First, as you well know, rightsizing our cost structure is incredibly important for us from -- as we think of forward for margin expansion and improving our financial returns. As we look through Q1 and through the balance of the year, keep in mind that the cost changes that we've made in the U.S. are largely complete. Obviously, in ex U.S., some of those changes lag, but you will see changes in the cost structure ex U.S. for the balance of the year.\n Those are probably not quite as large as we look forward compared to what has already happened at this point. But I would just say that this will be a constant focus for us as we think about cost and margin enhancements going forward. This is a -- now we're on a continual cycle of thinking about how we invest and what is the appropriate cost structure in support of our revenue objectives for this business going forward. Well, maybe I'll take that first. From a guide perspective, I would not -- we obviously did not expect this final adjustment. It was an estimate that we did at the end of the year. We're now finalizing the adjustment based on the returns that we've seen, and it is now complete. I would say that, as we look forward for the full year, both for PAXLOVID and for the full year of all of our products, we're cautiously optimistic about where we are.\n I think PAXLOVID started off from a very solid utilization. And keep in mind that product will trend consistent with infection rates across the globe. And we're still cautiously optimistic that we will achieve our objective, and we do not expect anything less than our original expectation at this point in time. Yes. On the gross margin side, as I said, there is a couple of things that impacted favorably our performance in Q1. The items that you listed of both new product launches and in-sourcing, the in-sourcing is probably a longer-term implication to us because those don't happen in an immediate quarter. So as you think about Seagen, it's probably a multiyear phenomenon that we have here. But I don't think that was an outsized impact to that. \n And obviously, the new launches, we plan for those to be compressing our gross margin rates, of which they did. I think we're off to a very solid start. But keep in mind what I said earlier, in the back half of the year, COMIRNATY sales will begin to ramp up. They compress our gross margin rate fairly significantly, given the partner contribution and payment that we have to our partners. So I would expect that to dampen our gross margin performance in the back half of the year.\n Umer, as you well know, we're focused on overdelivery, if we can. So I think we will do everything we can to continue to improve our performance there. \n And then finally, as we think about the balance sheet, first and foremost, I just want to reiterate that our #1 priority from a capital allocation perspective is both supporting and growing our dividend over time, and that is not at risk. Secondly, yes, we always look at the assets that we have across our platform and understand what's the best way to capitalize on those assets, and some of that may be monetizing some of that. Some of that may be operating more effectively. So everything is on the table from that perspective. So as it relates to your question regarding capital allocation, clearly, our first priority, our #1 priority is supporting both the dividend as well as delevering our balance sheet. So that is job 1 from my perspective. As it relates to bolt-on acquisitions, in the near term, you would not expect us to do much there. We are -- that is a lower priority in the near term until we get ourselves. I hope that helps. Yes. And I guess, as it relates to 2025 and the impact of the IRA from a margin expansion perspective, I would say, without giving any specifics on that is, as we look forward, we obviously run multiple scenarios around how our business might perform. And in those scenarios, we would model different impacts to the IRA because it's still unclear because it's still a lot of moving parts, specifically as we just spoke about. Under those scenarios, we will work hard to offset any implication we might have through improving our cost structure. Okay. Great. So yes, I think we just gave some color around gross margin being closer to 70% versus closer to 80% when we entered 2024. We are maintaining that color at this point in time. I would say that it's unlikely for our gross margin rate to fall below 70% in any given quarter. But I want to just emphasize the gross margin rate will fluctuate a bit, primarily given the mix of sales, specifically within the vaccine portfolio, which carries a lower gross margin, number one. \n Number two, when you look at our performance for gross margin in Q1, a dominant effect of that versus last year is the mix, the lower sales volume of COMIRNATY in the quarter in Q1 versus last year's Q1. Obviously, the final adjustment of the PAXLOVID reserve actually did also have a onetime positive impact on the gross margin rate in Q1, but that was less of an impact compared to the mix. So I hope that helps. Yes, thank you for the question. I would say that without giving -- since we don't guide to quarterly expectations for gross margin, I would just say that the focus that we have around improving our cost of goods sold is a multiyear journey. And these costs that we are working to improve take time to adjust and to further implement ways to be more effective and efficient in this infrastructure.\n So I wouldn't think of that having a significant impact on 2024 but more -- if it would, it would be late 2024 but more '25 and '26. But more to come. As we know more and as we develop our plans more specifically, we'll be certain to share some specifics around that. P"

We have already been out sharing a robust outcome for that. And filing is imminent to happen in U.S. FDA. We also have data coming on second season, full second season and data so far that have been available show robust and probably best-in-class profile for us. And you heard AAMIR mention, we also have new delivery format. So there is a lot of positive things happening to further strengthen ABRYSVO.\n For a formal decision on recommendation, ACIP normally wait until a product is FDA approved. We don't know exactly when FDA will potentially approve. We think, clearly, given this unique age range that it can happen to be meaningful for the fall, but that needs to be, of course, pending FDA's views. But we will certainly be very open to share data from several of these new important data sets that could help ACIP to understand the planning of the various RSV products. And we think that would be very helpful for ACIP as Abrysvo data set are robust and, in some sense, unique in a positive way. Thank you. Yes, yes. I'm excited about the potential approval for mastozimab for both hemophilia A and B to continue to grow our hematology franchise momentum. [indiscernible] in therapy, we actually today got the equivalent of Breakthrough Designation RMAT based on the early clinical data available, so we are super excited about that. And relatively near term, the readout is coming. COVID/flu combination vaccine, [ 859 ] readout Phase III. And then [indiscernible] pipeline onsegrimab  which I think pending readout has really a breakthrough mechanism. I think you said it so well on obesity. I'll focus on mRNA vaccine and just say that we did share that we had a very robust data for 18 to 59 in the outcome event trial on the first generation flu mRNA platform. We actually further refined that product in order to expand activity against these serotypes although the disease is dominated by A, we saw an opportunity to do that. And that technology is now with the COVID/flu combo vaccine running for 18 to 59 years old and relatively soon, we'll have a readout. We think that's really the near-term opportunity to bring both of the viruses under 1 simple administration approach. For the 65-plus, what you referred to was an early trial with the first generation. We have now moved focus to the second generation and are in preparation of subsequent clinical studies from them."

            "content": "Yes, I think just to add to what Dave has said, it's early days for as he pointed out, the 302, the data was -- we just launched early this year. We've already seen 164% year-on-year pro forma growth. It's early but we're very pleased that we've got NCCN Guidelines Category 1. We've got a New England Journal publication. We've got uptake in both academic and community settings. In fact, 70% of the current accounts on the community. And we're looking forward now because I think we're well set for the future in the muscle invasive bladder cancer setting and those 2 studies that we'll read out late in 2025, '26, '27. Thank you, Albert. So the reason Albert didn't list ELREXFIO as a major growth driver, just to remind, so he pointed out  LORBRENA, XTANDI and PADCEV as the immediate biggest growth drivers for Oncology. But we're absolutely confident that ELREXFIO will become, over the next couple of months and years, a major driver for Oncology. \n Just a reminder, we've seen very promising efficacy data in highly refractory patient populations with deep and durable responses. And we've reported the longest reported median progressive-free survival in the recurrent relapsed/refractory setting of 17.2 months. Now of course, recognizing there's no definitive conclusion as there's no head-to-head studies. We're currently encouraged by what we've seen with the uptake, with the build of new patient starts as we have planned. And we remain very optimistic with the future from the current indication as well as from the future indications. \n And a reminder that we have 4 ongoing registrational studies in the next 12 months. The first Phase III study would read out multiple -- in the MM5 study. We've also recently received J-code for access, and we're smoothing the reimbursement process and continue to gain favorable positions on various pathways, and in some, the most favorable pathways. We're looking forward to update you very soon on more things from ELREXFIO. Thank you very much. So as you know, we had a number of months planning prior to close to ensure we had a seamless integration. And we completed cross-training of our commercial field force teams in January, especially for breast cancer, between TUKYSA and IBRANCE, but also hematology between ADCETRIS and ELREXFIO. And we should start seeing that further playing out now over the coming months. \n As we've mentioned, we're obviously very pleased that there's been tremendous colleague retention, so we haven't had an issue with colleague retention, both from the legacy Pfizer and the legacy Seagen organization as we build a new business.\n We expect PADCEV to continue to do well. There's significant enthusiasm from health care providers, from patients, from patient advocacy groups because of the groundbreaking data, double the overall survival. So we are confident that we'll continue to see PADCEV growth. \n We've also seen TUKYSA, for instance, 21% year-over-year pro forma basis growth. And in fact, the last quarter was the highest performance of TUKYSA. So overall, great confidence, and we started the first new Phase III study with an NME from the Seagen portfolio with a secret attack. and we hope to update you on other Phase III studies from the legacy Seagen portfolio. Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Just a reminder to point out with IBRANCE that over 773,000 patients have now been treated globally with IBRANCE. So  it is currently still the CDK4/6 leader. We're very excited about 2 programs: vepdegestrant, which we believe to be best-in-class next-generation receptor degrader and also atimociclib, next-generation CDK4 specific inhibitor. \n For, as you point out, we'll get the data later this year for VERITAC-2, but we are planning additional studies at ROTH. You can expect to see first-line studies, both first-line study with atimociclib and standard of care endocrine therapy as well as a termocyclib-plus brand. [indiscernible] as you've seen in a heavily pretreated population, we've seen an overall response rate of 32% with medium progressive survival of 8.1 months. We're therefore highly encouraged.\n I'm definitely very encouraged by the safety profile and we see more continuous dosing, very good compliance and more complete coverage of CDK4, and that's why we're confident to accelerate CDK4 into a registration strategy and the first study has already started, as you know, the second-line study. Perhaps just to mention again the potential unprecedented new 5-year data for Lorbrenla, which will be presented at ASCO. We could define the growth of Lorbrenla over the next decade. There's 2 other upcoming readouts. And there's 2 other readouts that's important to us, the 1 is Breakwater, which is the first-line opportunity in BRAF-positive colorectal cancer. A reminder that, that's up to 12% of colorectal cancer. Particularly poor prognosis so we're looking forward to that readout, Breakwater and then also, as mentioned earlier, VERATEC 2 in second-line ER-positive breast cancer, which can define also the to define the future path for."

            "content": "Louise, thanks for the question. So it very much appears like the RSV vaccination market is following a seasonal trend, so you expect the dynamics in Q4 versus Q1 to be different. In Q1, what we saw for the market is for older adults, it certainly attenuated over the course of the quarter. So there was a peak in the second week of January, and then a steady week-by-week decline since then. \n Now in terms of the dynamics for our business and ABRYSVO, our performance was in line with what we expected. We think this will follow a seasonal trend. And we think we're very well positioned for the fall season for several reasons. \n One is we're progressing our retail contracting. Second is we have a real strength in the nonretail channel. You referred to GSK. They reported their revenues. When you look at the mix of U.S. revenues as reported, it's about a 60-40 mix. Our retail share is lower than that, but our nonretail share is much higher. And that portion of our business really doubled between Q4 and Q1 from about 9% to 17%. \n And I think that just speaks to our strength in doctors' offices and relationships we have with organized customers. And I'll also note that later this year, if approved, we will have a new presentation of ACT-O-VIAL, which demonstrates ease of administration, and also our clinical data, which Albert referred to in his remarks, for label expansion for ABRYSVO for 18- to 59-year-olds as well as -- that are at risk as well as durable efficacy through 2 seasons. I think the combination of these commercial efforts as well as potential label expansion really position us well for a fall season. Sure. Terence, thanks for the question. And as you can imagine, there's many moving parts to Part D redesign. I think relevant to our business, I think it's important to first note that as part of what already went into place with the redesign, there is no cost sharing imposed on vaccines. So that, given our significant vaccines portfolio, is a positive. And then, obviously, over the course of '24 and '25, there's other dynamics with out-of-pocket cost caps, which create better access for patients, and that is helpful to volumes, and we're starting to see that in '24 in some parts of our business, including on VYNDA. \n And then there's things to come, including a change in that cap as well as patient smoothing. So we'll see how that plays out. And obviously, there's also changes in how costs are shared between plans, manufacturers, government and patients. So how all of that gets implemented, we're tracking that very closely. We're not offering any specific guidance in terms of direct dollar impact on our business in 2025 because there's still a lot to come on this. And when we are ready to do that, we certainly will. Thanks for the question, Vamil. So I'm happy to talk a little bit about NURTEC. We'd like to accelerate the momentum of NURTEC, and we're taking several steps to do that. For the quarter itself, what we're encouraged by is the demand and the volumes that we saw. And then on the flip side, as you already alluded to, the performance in the quarter was impacted by gross to net. \n So on demand, a few points to just keep in mind. NURTEC continued its market leadership within the class with a 49% TRx share, and that was up 28% from Q1 of last year. Secondly, NBRx share, which we keep a very close eye on, that volume, as a whole, hit its high point since we closed the Biohaven acquisition at the end of '22. \n So that was up versus last year, but also, importantly, up versus Q4 of '23. And there were about 11,000 new NURTEC writers in Q1, and this is 90% of all the new writers within the oral CGRP class. So there's a lot about the volume and the demand that we're encouraged by.\n Now on gross to net, there were 3 issues this quarter. One is you typically tend to see this dynamic in the first quarter of every year. We saw that last year, too, just given the benefit design dynamics. Secondly, we did have some payer mix issues between government and commercial channels this quarter. And then finally, there was an unfavorable onetime prior period adjustment to our GTNs in Q1.\n Your question about the rest of the year, for NURTEC, we expect continued growth. We've talked about the fact -- the fundamentals in terms of untreated patients and undertreated patients remain strong. We also think that some of the gross to net that I described is going to be temporal and will slowly abate over the course of the rest of the year. And then we have made a number of changes in our commercial execution in terms of what we're doing with patient engagement and focusing our field force resources on physician awareness in a different way and also working to reduce friction for patient access. So overall, we do expect continued growth from NURTEC in the balance of '24. Sure. So Carter, I think you heard us describe the dynamics. And later this year, we will have more clarity on what that means. And so we can certainly share that. I think there's also a specific question that comes up often about Eliquis, so let me just address that now because we are clearly in a live negotiation on that. \n BMS, our alliance partner, is leading that process. You've heard them describe, and we also described that there will be transparency around the outcome of that for impact in '26 in the September time frame. And so at that point, we'll be in a position to share more. Okay. Chris, thanks for the question. So on Prevnar, you alluded to the commentary we provided around dimensionalizing the market, and I think it's worthwhile just reiterating that. So the adult market continues to contract and that's for 2 reasons. There are increasingly fewer eligible 65-plus adults. And then the 19 to 64 underlying medical conditions, population is obviously more difficult to activate. So that is a dynamic that is true for our business, but it's also true for any competitor that's going to come into the adult vaccine market. So I think that's important to note. \n Now for our overall franchise, we continue to expect growth. We did very nicely in Q1. We saw 6% growth. And the big driver of that is increased uptake as well as market share growth in the pediatric. So pediatrics in Q1 saw a lot of conversion, PCV 13 to 20. And our share exiting Q1 was at 80%, and that was from 71% at the time of launch of PCV 15. So we see good momentum on pediatrics. \n Now back to your question about the adult segment and competition. We're continuing to see very good performance where we are. We have 98% market share. We acknowledge that V116 is coming. And as Albert alluded to earlier, we're not going to speculate on what the regulatory outcomes or recommendations are going to be. But there are a number of things that we can do to defend our business in the adult segment. Firstly, we have a portfolio approach to contracting that we're deploying in the retail setting but also in the nonretail setting. \n And it's also important to note that in the nonretail setting, many organized customers have a preference for workflow management to stock 1 vaccine that satisfies all the current [indiscernible]. So until we know more, I think the best way to defend our share in the adult segment is to continue to do what we're doing. And that's to be laser-focused on maximizing the opportunity that we have in the adult segment, albeit contracting and then continue to drive growth in pediatrics. \n On your second question around consumers, look, engaging and activating consumers is, as you pointed out, a very, very important part of our business. It's true in vaccines. It's true in categories like PAXLOVID and NURTEC, just to name a few examples. And we're always looking at ways to enhance that connection. One example I'll point to is the work that we've done on VAXassist as a mechanism to help consumers determine their vaccine eligibility but also book appointments. And that's a really good example of value that we can bring. And to the extent that we can do more of that, create value for patients as well as for our business in other categories, we'll certainly look to explore that. Thanks, Chris. So on Abrysvo, as I said, we're progressing our contracting conversations so we'll have more to share on that as we do later. And in terms of your question on VYNDA, VYNDA had a really strong quarter. We were up 96% year-over-year, but importantly, also 41% over last quarter. When you look at the drivers, I think there's a few things. Some of that is temporal. So there were some purchasing patterns with wholesaler and specialty pharmacies.\n And we also made a lot of efforts towards the end of last year to ensure that the re-enrollment process for patients was very smooth at the beginning of this year. So all of that leads to a little bit of a Q1 bolus. But importantly at the heart of it, part of our strong performance on VYNDA is that the fundamentals around diagnosis and demand are really strong. So we saw a 33% quarter-over-quarter increase in new patient starts.\n And diagnosis rates over the last several years, we had talked about getting into the 30% to 50% range. We're approaching the top end of that. And there is still significant opportunity to identify more patients. That's the biggest unmet need, and that's where we're concentrating our commercial efforts going forward. So we do think that we will sustain this momentum, probably not at the same rate that we saw in Q1 but we will continue to perform well with VYNDA."

But we have a patent pending patent term extension, which would take it out to December of 2028. And we may be filing additional requests for patent term extensions while that is pending. In major European markets, our patents expire in November of 2026. And in Japan, the patent expires in 2026, but there's regulatory exclusivity through March of 2029 for cardiomyopathy. Sure. Just to be clear, Dave, we shouldn't think beyond December 2028 on VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX. So we've got a patent term extension that is filed and is pending. And all I was saying was that, in addition to that patent term extension, which would take it out to December 2028 that we filed and is pending, we may file additional patent term extensions, again, though, just to take it out to December 2028. I hope that's clear."
