At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q4 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChris Evenden: Thank you, Suzanne. Hi, everyone. Welcome to EA\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me from their homes today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings, our earnings release, our financial model, and our earnings slides are available at ir.ea.com. We will post an audio replay, a copy of these prepared remarks and a transcript after the call. With regards to our calendar, our Q1 fiscal 2021 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, July 30, 2020. Many of the usual opportunities we have to meet with investors, such as conferences, are unavailable at this time. We\u2019re building out a program of virtual tours to reach as many of you as possible over the coming weeks and months, directly and through partnering with sell-side analysts. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. And note in particular that these forward-looking statements may be affected by risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q and our earnings release for a discussion of risks, including those related to COVID-19 that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 5, 2020, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. This is a challenging time for everyone. As global citizens, we are all enduring a period of great uncertainty and continuing to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. We\u2019re here to report on our quarterly results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and Blake and I will speak to those. However, our focus first and foremost has been on the health and wellbeing of our teams and their families during the COVID-19 situation. I\u2019ll start by sharing a bit about our actions to support our employees around the world. We have an internal COVID-19 task force that has been tracking and making decisions on a daily basis since January to keep our teams safe, including early decisions to restrict business travel, cancel events, and close our Shanghai and Seoul facilities. By mid-March, we shifted nearly all of our global workforce to work-from-home in response to the growing threat of the pandemic. Through this transition, we\u2019ve put a heavy focus on ensuring our people have everything they need to balance the challenges of work and home life during stay-at-home orders and physical distancing. We continue to be in a work-from-home status for all of our locations outside of Shanghai. We have detailed protocols to evaluate our readiness to return in each of our offices when the time is right, accounting for guidance from health authorities and government, the comfort level of our employees, and preparation of our facilities for continued physical distancing. We\u2019re planning for the return to take place over an extended period as we make longer term changes to our locations and practices in response to the pandemic. We will continue to do everything we need to support our teams as we go forward. Moving to our results, we finished a strong year for Electronic Arts with fourth quarter and full-year revenue and earnings above our previously-raised guidance. The innovation that we are delivering to players across the breadth of our games and live services continues to drive strength in our business. I\u2019ll touch on a few examples from the year. EA SPORTS is a pillar of our portfolio and continues to bring more players together. FIFA is one of the biggest and most engaging entertainment franchises in the world. With approximately 100 million players engaging globally in our FIFA franchise, more than 25 million unique players have joined FIFA 20 so far, with VOLTA opening up an entirely new dimension to the game, and FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow as the most popular mode. FIFA Online in Asia also continues its momentum, significantly outperforming our expectations. Madden NFL is a cultural icon in football, gaming and entertainment, and it just had its biggest year ever. We took a new approach to launching and rolling out new modes of play in Madden NFL 20, and the result was the highest engagement levels in franchise history. Apex Legends was the most downloaded free-to-play game on PS4 in 2019, and continues to grow as an innovative, long-term service for players. It\u2019s been continually recognized as one of the best multiplayer experiences available, and with each new season of content, Respawn have been delivering more of what players love -- from lore, to new Legends, to in-game events. Before COVID-19 stay-at-home orders began, Season 4 was already outperforming each of the two prior seasons, and the Old Ways event in April has become the most successful ever for Apex. Our Apex esports tournaments have generated approximately two times the average viewing audience of other top esports leagues. Respawn have added more teams in our development organization to work on great new content, and we continue to have a strong focus on the thriving Apex Legends community. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the breakout titles of the last several years. More than 10 million unique players have joined the game since launch, a rare achievement for the first title in an entirely new franchise. It\u2019s a meticulously well-crafted game, and it continues to give fans a deeply-engaging and original Star Wars experience. The Sims 4 inspires an entirely different gaming audience, and one that continues to grow. It provides a completely unique experience from anything else on the market, and FY20 was its biggest year since launch. In every quarter this year, monthly average players in The Sims 4 were higher than the previous year. Our Sims community is diverse and highly creative, and our success continues to be built on delivering a wide variety of content and ways to engage for players with very different interests. With more people staying at home in the fourth quarter, we did see rising usage and engagement levels in many of our games. We\u2019re humbled to see people wanting to connect through our games during this time. In part, this has been made possible by the amazing work of our teams, and our technology investments across the Company. For more than five years, we\u2019ve been investing in a single technology infrastructure, architecture and digital platform as we accelerate into a digital world. That\u2019s enabled us to provide mobility for our employees in this environment and maintain strong productivity. But the real story is the people of Electronic Arts. We have such tremendously talented, dedicated and determined teams. They\u2019ve come together in the strongest and most inspiring way through this pandemic response period, in service of each other and in service of our players. And as a result, we\u2019ve been able to adapt and scale in this changing environment, where engagement in our games has reached new peaks and continues at elevated levels through the current quarter to date. We\u2019ve had a deep focus on our players through this time. Our amazing studio teams have delivered great live service content while working from home, including FIFA Ultimate Team events, Madden Ultimate Team content for the NFL Draft, and new additions to Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. We also launched our Stay Home, Play Together initiative to do some special things for our players as shelter-in-place orders began to take effect in March. Thanks to the dedicated work of our teams and our partners, we\u2019ve delivered dozens of Stay & Play programs to date, from special community livestreams and giveaways, to athletes and celebrities playing our games with fans. Our esports teams launched a fully cloud-based broadcasting platform that allows us to produce high-quality esports content with competitors, hosts and production staff all safely at home. We\u2019ve since conducted major online tournaments for Apex Legends, Madden NFL 20, FIFA Online 4 and FIFA 20, including the FIFA Stay & Play Cup, a $1 million charity tournament for COVID-19 relief that brought together top European Clubs and footballers and aired in more than 100 countries. We\u2019ve now executed, or plan to execute in the coming months, more than 100 celebrity, athlete, community and charity online esports events. This global crisis has also been hitting local communities very hard, and we\u2019ve increased the funding in our charitable match program to support local organizations around the world. Our teams have also been doing extraordinary things to help in their communities from sourcing quantities of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers to food drives and much more, and we\u2019re supporting them in any way we can. I want to say a huge thanks again to the people of Electronic Arts for making all of this possible. Because of their fast and determined work, we\u2019ve responded well to this global challenge, and we\u2019re in a good position to continue connecting more players through great games and content, and supporting our communities when and where they need it most. Looking to FY21, we are growing our portfolio of high-quality and innovative new games. We are planning to launch 14 new titles to players this fiscal year. That includes four new EA SPORTS titles, FIFA, Madden, NHL and one more unannounced sports title, all of which deliver on the mix of creativity, authenticity and quality that sets EA SPORTS apart. EA SPORTS will also lead for us on the next-generation consoles this year, and we\u2019re excited to share more about the breakthroughs in those experiences soon. Our FY21 plans also include four more games drawing on the breadth of our IP, from Command & Conquer Remastered to unannounced games for our console and PC. We\u2019ll have more games from indie developers launching this year through EA Partners, and two new mobile titles leveraging top IP that we\u2019ll bring to players worldwide. With our teams\u2019 expertise in live services, we\u2019re also building some of the biggest ongoing experiences in the industry. We have a lot more for the growing Apex Legends community this year, starting next week with Season 5. Maxis will continue delivering Sims 4 content that empowers self-expression and fuels the creativity of our diverse player audience. In addition to our new EA SPORTS games, we\u2019ll continue delivering fans\u2019 daily connection to sports through our live services, even if the real-world leagues and teams aren\u2019t back in action yet. And we are also working to bring more content in FIFA Online and Apex Legends in Asia that will excite our current players and welcome new ones. This year, we plan to grow our communities across more platforms and ways to play. Building on our announcement with Google Stadia last week, we plan to bring our games to more digital distribution channels. We\u2019ll take our subscription service to a fourth platform in Steam. And we\u2019re also planning to deliver for more Nintendo fans, with multiple EA games set to launch on Nintendo Switch this year. As we begin FY21, our outlook for the year is strong. We also know there is uncertainty ahead as the COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. Factors like macroeconomic challenges, the status of sports seasons, unknown impacts to our business partners, and long-term impacts to our productivity in a global work-from-home environment are among the areas we will be watching closely and could affect both player behavior and our ability to deliver on our planned timelines. We\u2019re thankful for the extraordinary people that we have at Electronic Arts, and for their dedication to each other, to our players, to our communities, and our Company. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019ve had a strong year. But it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I\u2019d like to focus on the impact we\u2019re seeing on our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and wellbeing of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the Company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven\u2019t yet solved all the problems, but, for example we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event; Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch; and we expect to see the next Sims expansion and Command & Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA. Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you\u2019ve heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we\u2019ve seen a corresponding large rise in live services revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter prove the value of the live services path we\u2019ve been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this, to meet player needs in a variety of ways. The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games, with sales actually above where we would expect them to be at this time of year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog, and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009, compared to only 20% last year. Turning to our results. I\u2019ll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion, cost of revenue $1.37 billion, operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including one-time net tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion. Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year-on-year, driven by strength across our business. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenue for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter-end, we have completed our two-year, $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty in the market and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution, our business today is extremely strong. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes, with $600 million maturing in March 2021, and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than fiscal 2020 free cash flow. Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion, with the beat versus expectations driven by the Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live services net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago, offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly through fiscal 2020. Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year, driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year, driven by the launch of Anthem in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last twelve months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year. Looking ahead to the next 12 months, we are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we\u2019re providing to our players through live services, and the new games we have on our slate. The market outlook is uncertain, but we\u2019re basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid single digits in calendar 2020, with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are currently performing extremely well, it is not yet known when professional sports might resume, nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are proving to be a popular competitive outlet for football, soccer and hockey fans. There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games. And the guidance I\u2019m about to provide is predicated on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios which will be announced in coming quarters. We\u2019re not seeing material impact on our FY21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles, where we have less control. Finally, with regard to the potential impact of the recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient, as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss three changes we are making with regards to reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net, to align with industry practice. Finally, we are updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales, in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We\u2019ve published more details on our IR website. Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember FY20\u2019s GAAP EPS includes a one-time tax benefits of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%. With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year, with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes, and higher variable compensation, and lower interest income. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services, plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we\u2019d note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties introduced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020; and full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2021, up 1% on a like-for-like basis. On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% in fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense control in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we\u2019re seeing very strong engagement and net bookings growth to date, we\u2019re only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control, thus we are taking a more cautious view than normal. As usual, we\u2019ve presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We\u2019ve made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing. But it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year, nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition. I\u2019ll finish by personally thanking everybody at the Company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to delivery games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks Blake. We feel very fortunate at Electronic Arts to have the opportunity to bring games and entertainment to people around the world. That\u2019s true every day, but it\u2019s especially true during this unprecedented situation. Our ability to fulfill important motivations for players, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, creation, and learning has brought more people to connect and spend time in our games in the recent weeks and months of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. We\u2019ve seen games be a source of joy for hundreds of millions of players. We will now look to be delivering for these players for a long time to come. Our focus continues to be on delivering great games and content through the breadth and depth of our portfolio, in our ongoing live services, and by connecting more players through our games via more distribution channels and platforms. With the incredible determination of our teams, we\u2019ve been able to keep producing new experiences from our homes around the world. And as we continue to work through this global challenge, we plan to continue delivering a lot of new games, new experiences, and exciting ways to play this year. How we live, work and play will undoubtedly be changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We\u2019re humbled that games have been part of how people are coming together. We will continue to serve our people, our players, and our local communities by helping them in any way that we can. To everyone listening in to this call, please be safe and be well. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey Andrew, hey Blake. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. You guys have talked a little bit about Battlefield, being pushed out to fiscal \u201822. Wonder if you could maybe just give us any other color or comments or thoughts on other kind of pipeline projects as we look out in the out years. And then, secondly on Apex, just wondering if you could give us any incremental thoughts or color around the launch on mobile, progress in China, any minimum guarantee that might fall into this year? Any color you can offer there would be helpful. Thanks guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Let me take the kind of out year projects and maybe Apex in Asia. First, I would say, Battlefield is progressing very, very well. We\u2019re excited by what the team\u2019s doing. And again, in the context of the work-at-home environment that had been truly inspirational and how that continued to develop great entertainment in the context of our Battlefield universe. So, I\u2019m excited for when next year comes. In terms of, specific announcements around what might be coming in out years, I would tell you that we don\u2019t have anything to announce today. But more broadly, you should imagine that we\u2019re going to continue to invest heavily in our EA SPORTS branded properties, bringing some new properties back, over the coming years. We\u2019ve talked before about having new IP in development, both for console and PC and for mobile. We\u2019re excited about that. And I\u2019d also say we\u2019ve got a number of new incubation products that are starting to come together that are looking exciting for the future as well. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had as robust a pipeline of content ahead of us as we have right now. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had the level of execution that we\u2019re seeing around the development of launch of content and the management of ongoing live services than we have right now. And while there are always challenges and interesting hurdles that we face delivering great interactive entertainment experiences, I would tell you I\u2019m very excited by what I see more so than I have been for our pipeline for a long time. With respect to Apex, I think, it falls into that category. We don\u2019t have any specifics or announced beyond what we\u2019ve already talked about, other than to say, I just saw the results of our Season 5 trailer for Apex today. So, we dropped it. It has a 99% approval rate and is the top trending video on YouTube games today. That in conjunction with some game play we saw in our Apex mobile title, I feel very excited about that franchise overall.\nBlake Jorgensen: Just to add, trust that we are well along the way with our partner in Asia on Apex mobile and PC. But, we\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s going on. And we have a very, very small number in there for this fiscal year. So, I don\u2019t see any risk, if that takes longer. But, the partner is working very hard to get it out as fast as possible. And I echo what Andrew just said. If you check out the trailer, on Season 5, I think what you\u2019ll see is we continue to evolve this live service. And remember, this is a live service and it is why it\u2019s so exciting. And we\u2019re adding interesting, exciting new content. And then, as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home. And I think that\u2019s an important message that shouldn\u2019t be ignored, because it is not easy. And what we\u2019ve proven to ourselves, we didn\u2019t think it was possible, but it\u2019s proving that, at least so far -- we know there\u2019s risks going forward, but it\u2019s amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home. And, just check out the trailer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan, UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe two questions. I think, investors have struggled with sort of understanding maybe the rate of change of engagement and monetization. Is there a way to sort of frame either specific titles or across your portfolio what you\u2019ve seen in March and April versus what historical trends have been in January and February before the new normal? And then, a bigger picture question. Are there any learnings you\u2019re getting from this period in March and April that are informing the way you\u2019re thinking about either product development or ways in which to tie engagement and monetization more broadly together, as you think about the long-term future for gaming? Thanks so much, guys.\nBlake Jorgensen: So, let me start with the first part. And then, Andrew can probably talk a little bit about the development piece. I think, as most people know, our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn\u2019t have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi: Fallen Order, which was strong, but it was really a live service quarter for us. And, as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the ultimate team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of two things inside of EA, the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. And in a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it\u2019s incredible, the level of engagement we saw and obviously the level of revenue growth we saw during that timeframe. Madden on its own was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen, and the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen. And much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun. And then, we\u2019re pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But, I think, people always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we\u2019ve built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I\u2019ll let you, jump in on the development.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So, I would take it in three categories. One is, are there any metrics that we could point to just kind of speak to the level of elevation we\u2019ve seen. I would tell you that FIFA hours watched in April were up 135% over last April, and are up 115% for Madden. Esports TV broadcast hours in U.S. in April were up 250% over last year. And April alone was 30% bigger than all of calendar year 2019. So, we\u2019re seeing tremendous engagement in the unbelievable creativity and innovation that our teams are delivering. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, I think of that in two buckets. One is, just how do we think about building games going forward and how do we think players will engage as things start to return to normal? Again, I would take this opportunity to celebrate the creativity and ingenuity of our teams. They have been truly inspirational in how they have come together and how they work and build games and create games and deliver epic entertainment to our global audience of players. We had already, over the last five years, started to move towards a distributed development model. We utilized the best creative talent in a number of different regions around the world to come together and build spectacular entertainment for players. I think what we have learned through this process is that there are new areas of innovation and creativity that we can unlock in a distributed model. And some of the foundations that our teams are building in the context of developing games, of developing motion capture, of developing a commentary of filing games are going to be really helpful for us on a go forward basis. I also spoke to in the prepared remarks about how our esports teams have built a fully cloud-based broadcast model. Again, we have a wonderful facility at our head office, and we\u2019ll use other people\u2019s facilities to bring people together and broadcast esports events. But, we\u2019ve been able to deliver hundreds and hundreds of hours of esports content completely remotely with hosts, broadcasters, players and fans all safely at home. I believe this will accelerate our ability to develop and deliver amazing esports content to a global audience and continue to fulfill the insatiable appetite that is absolutely there that we\u2019re seeing right now. As it relates to gamers. Again, I think, it\u2019s too early to tell. But, a few things we know are true. One is that games fulfill these core motivations that we have, the ones I talked about in prepared remarks like inspiration and escape and social connection and competition and creation and learning better than just about any other form of entertainment on the planet. And there are many, many new players who are coming and discovering just how wonderful games are and the joy of games and how spectacularly they can bring people together. And our expectation is that people having invested this time and built relationships with friends through new games they are playing will continue to drive engagement over the long term. And our objective, of course, is to fully support them as they move through this COVID-19 phase and ensure that we\u2019re able to continue to fulfill the motivations they have, even as we get on the other side of this.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin of Needham. Your line is open.\nLaura Martin: Hello, there. Thanks for taking the questions. So, it sort of sounds, Andrew, from a lot of your comments that we\u2019re getting nice TAM expansion. You said Sims 4 had new and different audiences from your other games. And then, you said Apex Legends esports was up twofold audiences. I guess, my question is, do you think that one of the unintended consequences of COVID-19 is we\u2019re going to get more gender diversity and a faster move out of sort of passive programming into sort of more interactive or more lean forward programming that you guys benefit from? And then, Blake for you, Andrew was just talking about these maybe more distributors pivot towards more distributed, you\u2019ve been working on for last five years. Could you talk through what the impact on the P&L would be over maybe in 2021, a little further out maybe than the COVID-disruptive period, and how much money that might save on the P&L, if we do move to a distributed talent base system? Thanks guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Let me grab the first one and then I\u2019ll hand off to Blake. First and foremost, what we have tried to do as a company is build a broad and deep portfolio that speaks to and entertains a diverse global population. And you see that across our sports titles and Battlefield like titles and Sims titles and Apex titles that give you different experiences across different platforms, across different business models and different geographies. And that has been at the very core of our strategy as Electronic Arts. And what we are seeing through this period of time is as more people come to recognize the true joy of interactive entertainment, a the true joy of gaming, even as I think linear media has also benefited through this time. I do believe that engagement will be more consistent in interactive industry over time. I do believe we\u2019re seeing new players come in who maybe hadn\u2019t played before and who are experiencing the goodness that comes from connecting with friends in a truly interactive environment through games. We\u2019re excited about that. We\u2019re excited to deliver new and interesting and innovative and creative entertainment to fans. And we\u2019re very happy to see that the whole strategy of a broad and deep portfolio that speaks to and entertains a global diverse audience is answering the needs of the global community this time.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. In terms of the expense side, it\u2019s really still early to tell. We know for the next, at least two quarters, the quarter we\u2019re in now and the following quarter, we will see virtually no travel and entertainment expenses that we would normally see. We\u2019re obviously -- both Gamescom and E3 have been canceled. Many of the industry events that typically would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together, were canceled. So, obviously, we\u2019ll see some savings there. We don\u2019t really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now. But I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices. What that looks like that could actually change expenses in the negative way. I hope not. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We hope that we are going actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But, it\u2019s early days to say. But, I know at least in the near term, we will see some savings and we\u2019ve tried to reflect that in some of our guidance. But, we don\u2019t really have a sense of how long this will go. We\u2019re currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We\u2019re not going to bring everybody back on day one, and I think most companies are going through the same thing. But, I do think in this year, we\u2019re probably in a better position for not having large OpEx, because we\u2019re not hiring as much, and we\u2019re not spending as much on things like travel, but I do think the unknown is really the following years going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey of Benchmark.\nMike Hickey: Two on M&A. Just curious, if you\u2019re I guess more interested in potential deals here, considering the current environment, or if you\u2019re seeing more opportunities emerge to partner or acquire smaller game companies? Then second question, and obviously, the gaming business is already looking good compared to the traditional media business. So, now, I guess, considering how you see your peers are performing, player engagement is strong, ability to continue to create content from home as you said is significant countercyclical to economic downturn. Do you think, this could sort of, I guess, reshape the perception of your business from potentially larger media companies or otherwise, and that\u2019s the catalyst for potential acquisitions over time?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. Mike, it\u2019s hard to say. I mean, right now, we\u2019re working obviously, as we\u2019ve talked about, with a lot of third-party companies for titles for the coming -- this year and following year. So, that\u2019s -- for us, we stay very close to them and we\u2019re doing everything possible we can to support those companies in a tough position. But, at the same time, companies that do have games in the market are obviously doing well, similar to what you\u2019re saying with us and other public companies. So, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s turning a catalyst to M&A. We do feel like this will continue longer term to emphasize the fact that scale is incredibly important in this business. And maybe that turns into something which helps us with M&A going forward. Our model right now is really simple, which is stay close to all the companies we know. It\u2019s harder because you can\u2019t go meet with them face to face, but stay close to them on the phone, on Zoom, whatever it is, and make sure you\u2019re supportive, because we believe longer term that helps us potentially get a deeper partnership with them. And that\u2019s about all I can say now. And we\u2019ll see how that plays out over time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JP Morgan.\nZilu Pan: Hi. This is the Zilu Pan on for Alexia. Thanks for taking our question. We were just wondering if you can give us a sense of what you think spending might trend after stay-at-home orders get lifted. Any patterns you might be seeing in countries that have already eased restrictions? And then, just as a follow-up. Are there any concerns that the sports games might get a little stale without live sports events resuming in time for the fall releases? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: It\u2019s too early for us to be able to really assess any places where regulations have lifted, because I mean Shanghai is probably -- China is probably the only place we\u2019re starting to see that. So, it\u2019s early. I don\u2019t -- I think, you should assume our costs won\u2019t change versus what they\u2019ve been historically. A real question is going to be do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters? And I think, we will, and that\u2019s built into our guidance. But, I don\u2019t have a sense of does that last another year or more. So, I think that will take some time for us to really better understand. And as both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team? We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry. And that\u2019s our number one focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend, to make sure that that happens. In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is two things. The economy, what really happens to the economy over time? Today, we see our core audience spending because they\u2019re at home more. But, does that change over time? And then,, the second challenge is, what\u2019s the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time? We know today people are engaging with sports, because that\u2019s what they love to do. If you are a sports fair, it doesn\u2019t stop. And so, the only way they\u2019re getting their sports engagement is through our games. And that\u2019s a huge benefit for us. But we don\u2019t know, because there\u2019s no precedent on this is what happens long term, if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But, we do believe that everything we\u2019re seeing now and everything we\u2019re seeing, particularly in esports, is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love. And don\u2019t forget the social part, because remember, people don\u2019t sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know, engage in that sports. And what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So, we hope that that bodes for a great season going forward. But, we\u2019ve never been in a time like this before. And so, that\u2019s why you\u2019re hearing any caution from us.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. And I would echo Blake\u2019s caution. But, I would also point to the amazing work our teams have done in the past and have been doing over the last couple of months. We have a long history of creating spectacular sports content. It\u2019s not actually directly dependent or reliant on the real world of sports. Ultimate Scream, Team of the Partial Season in FIFA, Zero Chill in Madden -- Ultimate Freeze in Madden Mobile. Our teams are very close to the playing communities. They interact with them deeply on a daily basis and have been truly creative and innovative, how they have put things together and delivered experiences to players through the last few months to ensure that those suppliers remain connected to the players, the teams, the leagues and the fans that they love to spend time with. I actually believe that there is an opportunity for us to continue to do that for players even if sports are delayed or don\u2019t make it back this year.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAlex Giaimo: Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just get a general update on your relationship with the NFL. We saw a competitor agree to publish non-simulated NFL games. So, I guess, the question is, do you think there\u2019s any risk to that the NFL opens up its simulated license at some point? And then, sticking to sports, sorry, I missed this earlier, but was there any update as to your plans with the NBA live franchise? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Again, I would point to the year we just had with Madden NFL, the single biggest year in the franchise, a truly innovative developed game and an innovatively launched game in the context of how the team, development team came together and built new experiences, targeting new and younger players in the context of NFL football and how our marketing team kind of launched those experiences in multiple launches and target those multiple groups of different players. And the result is, the best year in Madden history. I would tell you, our relationship with the NFL was very, very strong. We look forward to building NFL games for many years to come. And what you should expect from us over time is that we will continue to build out our NFL football offerings, both in the context of building on the Madden platform. Again, when you think about gamers, the biggest -- one of the most important things for them is a sense of community and being part of such a big community, like the Madden community, whether they\u2019re playing front line 11 or 11 simulation football or they\u2019re applying the fast knockout mode that we launched this year or whether they start to play some of the new modes we plan to deliver in the future on console, on PC and on mobile. So, we\u2019re excited about our football future and believe that it will continue to be a strong part of our portfolio and a really strong offering for football fans for many years to come. With respect to NBA live, nothing more to announce at this, other than I would also tell you we have a great relationship with the NBA. We\u2019ve been partners with them for a very long time. I\u2019ve personally spent time with NBA at the most senior levels, talking about innovative new ways to deliver new interactive content to NBA fans that maybe aren\u2019t engaging in games today. And we\u2019ll have more to share on that in the coming months.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDrew Crum: Blake, I wondered if you could deconstruct the performance of live services during the quarter, understanding that the Apex comp was difficult. What were some of the puts and takes on the 7% decline? And I apologize if I missed any commentary on ultimate team. And then, separately, can you just comment on your expectations for your mobile business to be up 1% in fiscal \u201821 against the market you\u2019re forecasting to be up 7%? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, sure. Thanks. Good questions. So, on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last September -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so, the massive business. And then we\u2019ve settled into a regular cadence and we\u2019ve been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we\u2019ve had, and we\u2019re feeling very good about that. The second piece is, we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- let\u2019s call the first FUT birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event from the end of March into the first two weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content, knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it\u2019s one of the biggest events of the year. And so, you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4, compared to previous year Q4. Those were the two biggest drivers. On the positive side, Madden, both live service that Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February-March timeframe is rare, because it\u2019s post the Super Bowl, but it\u2019s been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I even said on the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We\u2019re still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But, as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so, that\u2019s kind of the puts and takes. And then, on top of that, I would say Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn\u2019t stop. And I guess, Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter-after-quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team and incredible product and amazing engagement. And so, you can say -- put it all on the Apex, last year, unbelievable benefit, and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter. Mobile, the way we\u2019ve approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch, much longer than they have historically. And so, we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is, is that we can exceed that, but that\u2019s how we\u2019ve built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile titles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well, things like SimCity continued to perform extremely well. And while we\u2019re not growing dramatically, we\u2019re still extremely profitable across those titles. And our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix, will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: One kind of big picture one very near-term, a big picture question. With so many different new platforms to launch on, should we expect sort of the cadence between titles to kind of lengthen and going forward, kind of dig into the catalog and find things that either could be brought back to life or remastered, or how does the broader platform strategy affected -- how should we think about it affecting future game development? And then, my second question, probably is more for Blake. Could you, if you could, give us some color on sort of almost -- has the sports title seen any sort of -- any sort of deterioration at all, relative to the other titles, through the month of April at all, or how should we think about the guidance on a ongoing forward basis of how you\u2019re building sort of resection, no sports, lots of sports? So, maybe any part of the day when you think sports are coming back.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. Andrew, do you want to start with the first one?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, absolutely. I would say, the strength of Electronic Arts is built on our ability to be platform agnostic. We\u2019ve been able -- throughout our history, we\u2019ve been able to get to platforms with more titles of high quality than most everyone else in the industry. It is a position we\u2019re very proud of and we continue to drive against that. Six or seven years ago, we anticipated that to be many more new platforms we would have to build on over time and that ultimately cloud would also emerge as its own platform across a number of different companies or portals. And part of the reason we moved the organization to a single digital platform, single ID, single commerce, single data, single infrastructure, single security, and we moved the organization to a single engine in Frostbite was in anticipation of this. So, as these new platforms come online, we\u2019re able to get to them more quickly and more efficiently and at higher quality than maybe our competitors can, who are working on multiple platforms and multiple engines and actually really use our scale to our advantage and our ability to do that. And what you\u2019re seeing from us now is our ability to get to console and new consoles and PC, Steam and Stadia and mobile, and you should expect that we -- and Switch. And you should expect that we will continue to look to deliver great content on any and all new platforms that we think have the ability to reach critical mass of gamers. In the context of overall time between games, I think it\u2019s different by game. What we know to be true is that games are getting bigger and more complex in development, but they\u2019re also entertaining significantly more, players on each release basis and holding on to those players for much, much longer through ongoing engagement in large services and social interaction. And so, as we think about our broader portfolio, you\u2019ll continue to see us launch games on an annualized basis. Our sports games would be a good example there. You will continue to see us launch games on a multiyear basis, things like Battlefield or some of our titles out of Dragon Age would be a good example of that. You\u2019ll continue to see us think about games on a five and six-year time horizon. The Sims which launched the game over five years ago and continues to grow every year through extra content live services would be an example of that. And then, you\u2019ll see us launch true platform games, like Apex Legends, which we expect will have -- continue to grow over the next decade. So, again, I would come back to, I feel good about how we have moved the Company on a technology basis that puts us in a position to reach as many players as possible across geographies, across platforms, across business models, across genres, as this global playing audience continues to expand.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. And I\u2019ll try to address second part of your question. First, I would just remind everybody, which I think you all know, but, we\u2019ve just finished a year in which we raised guidance three times and delivered on that with beats every time. We just put out guidance for next year, probably -- or this year, coming year that we\u2019re in right now in probably the most uncertain time that we\u2019ve ever faced. And yet -- and we\u2019ve cautioned everyone and we\u2019ve put caveats on everything. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to transpire. But, we were still willing to come out and put out guidance that we thought would grow both, top-line and bottom-line year-over-year. Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS. And we just provided you guys for $0.70 in EPS. And the business could fall off the cliff tomorrow, and we would be dead wrong. But, I think all of you know how Andrew and I and all of our teams have been very conservative. I would think about that as you\u2019re thinking about the year forward. So with that wonderful syllabically [ph] or however you say that, we will end the call. And I appreciate everybody. And most important make sure your families are healthy, you\u2019re spending time with them, and you all stay healthy as well, because we need to have you guys around to help us in the marketplace. So, thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Be well, stay healthy, stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: And this conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We've had a strong year. But it is impossible for me to reflect on the past 12 months without acknowledging that we are all currently going through a very difficult time, and I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and safe. I'd like to focus on the impact we're seeing on our business. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety and wellbeing of our people. Andrew has given you a brief introduction to the measures we have taken and continue to take. Teams across the Company have shown extraordinary innovation in meeting the challenges of delivering games from home. Developing a game from home inevitably carries risks, and we haven't yet solved all the problems, but, for example we just had a very successful FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event; Apex Legends Season 5 is about to launch; and we expect to see the next Sims expansion and Command & Conquer Remastered to both launch in June as scheduled. Learning from this period will forever change the way we work at EA. Secondly, there is a question as to how this might affect how players behave. From Andrew, you've heard that people are playing our games a lot more, and we've seen a corresponding large rise in live services revenues that continues today. Our results this quarter prove the value of the live services path we've been on now for a decade. The breadth and depth of our live services give us tremendous flexibility at times like this, to meet player needs in a variety of ways. The closure of physical retail has not yet affected the sales of full games, with sales actually above where we would expect them to be at this time of year. This suggests that people who want a game are finding a title in our catalog, and downloading a digital copy or ordering a physical copy online. In addition, the shift to digital since the last recession reduces both the impact of store closures and of inventory risk. Physical game sales comprised 84% of our annual net bookings in fiscal 2009, compared to only 20% last year. Turning to our results. I'll report them on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $5.54 billion, cost of revenue $1.37 billion, operating income was $1.45 billion, delivering an EPS of $10.30, including one-time net tax benefit of $5.97 that we previously discussed. These results enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.66 billion. Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $5.21 billion, up 5.4% year-on-year. At constant currency, growth would have been over 7%. Digital net bookings accounted for $4.05 billion of this. Live services net bookings were $2.78 billion, up 15% year-on-year, driven by strength across our business. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter. GAAP net revenue for the quarter were $1.39 billion, above our guidance by $62 million. Operating expenses were $717 million, slightly less than we guided. Operating income was $401 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.43, $0.38 better than our guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $498 million, down $101 million from last year, driven by increased royalties and cash taxes paid. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $458 million. You can see this in our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $291 million. Since quarter-end, we have completed our two-year, $2.4 billion repurchase program. Due to the uncertainty in the market and in the economy, management and the Board have chosen to postpone a review of our capital return plans until next quarter. Let me emphasize that this is a precaution, our business today is extremely strong. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.74 billion. Our balance sheet is very strong. With regards to debt, we have $1 billion in senior notes, with $600 million maturing in March 2021, and $400 million due in 2026. Our debt equates to significantly less than fiscal 2020 free cash flow. Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings were $1.21 billion, well above our guidance of $1.15 billion, driven by our digital business. Digital net bookings were $1.12 billion, with the beat versus expectations driven by the Sims 4 and Apex Legends. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 75% in the prior year. Live services net bookings were $789 million. The year-on-year decrease is driven by the massive launch of Apex Legends a year ago, offset by growth across the rest of our live services. Ultimate Team grew strongly through fiscal 2020. Mobile delivered net bookings of $138 million, up 2% year-on-year, driven by our sports titles in Asia. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $190 million, down 11% from last year, driven by the launch of Anthem in the year-ago quarter, partially offset by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last twelve months, and we continue to model underlying growth at 5 percentage points per year. Looking ahead to the next 12 months, we are focused first and foremost on supporting our people, helping them cope with the world in which we find ourselves. Second, we are focused on enabling them to deliver the new content we're providing to our players through live services, and the new games we have on our slate. The market outlook is uncertain, but we're basing our modeling on the gaming software market growing in mid single digits in calendar 2020, with mobile up 7%, console up 5% and PC up 5% in dollar terms. In addition, although our sports live services are currently performing extremely well, it is not yet known when professional sports might resume, nor what the impact on our business might be if that takes some time. In the meantime, our esports activities are proving to be a popular competitive outlet for football, soccer and hockey fans. There are also risks associated with our ability to deliver new games. And the guidance I'm about to provide is predicated on the title slate as outlined in the earnings presentation on our website. Note that this slide only identifies those titles that are already announced. As we have previously stated, our FY21 revenue forecast includes additional titles from both EA and third-party studios which will be announced in coming quarters. We're not seeing material impact on our FY21 title slate, but that could change, and the risk is higher for third-party titles, where we have less control. Finally, with regard to the potential impact of the recession. The video game market has historically proven resilient, as players have seen games as a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment. Nevertheless, future economic indicators are extremely weak and may affect our business. Before I get to the numbers, let me also discuss three changes we are making with regards to reporting. First, we will present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Secondly, we will report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net, to align with industry practice. Finally, we are updating the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live service sales, in line with the direction we continue to drive the business. We've published more details on our IR website. Guidance for fiscal 2021 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.525 billion, cost of revenue $1.382 billion and GAAP EPS of $3.35. As you compare with last year, remember FY20's GAAP EPS includes a one-time tax benefits of $5.97 per share. We continue to forecast our management tax rate for the fiscal 2021 to be 18%. With regards to cash flow for fiscal 2021, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion. Free cash flow is down slightly year-on-year, with higher underlying profits more than offset by higher cash taxes, and higher variable compensation, and lower interest income. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 3.3% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Growth is primarily driven by live services, plus strong sports launches and a broad portfolio of partner titles. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $60 million, although we'd note that exchange rates are likely to be more volatile in the near term as the result of market uncertainties introduced by the pandemic. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, we expect live services and other to be $3.85 billion in fiscal 2021, up 7% compared to fiscal 2020; and full game net bookings to be $1.7 billion, down almost 5% year-on-year. Finally, with live services, we expect mobile to deliver net bookings of $721 million in fiscal 2021, up 1% on a like-for-like basis. On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow 2% in fiscal 2021, reflecting tight expense control in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $1 billion. While we're seeing very strong engagement and net bookings growth to date, we're only a month into the quarter, and our current levels of engagement and monetization could subside as stay-at-home orders are eased and lifted. In addition, the swing factors discussed above in these unprecedented times are potentially huge, impossible to forecast and beyond our control, thus we are taking a more cautious view than normal. As usual, we've presented the quarterly phasing of our net bookings in our earnings presentation. Note that this year the phasing includes the effect of revenue recognition from the games we are launching for the current generation of consoles that can also be upgraded free for the next generation. We've made a preliminary estimate of that impact in the phasing. But it should be noted that this will not affect net bookings for the full year, nor cash flow, just the timing of recognition. I'll finish by personally thanking everybody at the Company for rising to the challenge. Every one of you have shown energy and ingenuity to enable us to delivery games and content at a time when players want them the most. Thank you. With that, I'll hand it back to Andrew. Just to add, trust that we are well along the way with our partner in Asia on Apex mobile and PC. But, we're very excited about what's going on. And we have a very, very small number in there for this fiscal year. So, I don't see any risk, if that takes longer. But, the partner is working very hard to get it out as fast as possible. And I echo what Andrew just said. If you check out the trailer, on Season 5, I think what you'll see is we continue to evolve this live service. And remember, this is a live service and it is why it's so exciting. And we're adding interesting, exciting new content. And then, as you look at the trailer, remember, the team did a huge part of this game from home. And I think that's an important message that shouldn't be ignored, because it is not easy. And what we've proven to ourselves, we didn't think it was possible, but it's proving that, at least so far -- we know there's risks going forward, but it's amazing what the teams have been able to do working apart from each other from home. And, just check out the trailer. So, let me start with the first part. And then, Andrew can probably talk a little bit about the development piece. I think, as most people know, our back half of this year, unlike last year, didn't have any new titles. We obviously benefited from follow-on sales for Jedi: Fallen Order, which was strong, but it was really a live service quarter for us. And, as you can see from the numbers, it exceeded our expectations and our guidance substantially. The big drivers on that are Apex, the ultimate team businesses across the board and our catalog of great titles. And people always underestimate the power of two things inside of EA, the catalog and live services. And we continue to build more and more live services that engage people socially and bring people to -- or allow people to enjoy things that they love. And in a world where there was no sports, we became sports for people. And if you look at our business across Madden, FIFA, hockey, it's incredible, the level of engagement we saw and obviously the level of revenue growth we saw during that timeframe. Madden on its own was the biggest Madden year we have ever seen, and the biggest Madden Ultimate Team year we have ever seen. And much of that due to the amazing work the game teams did in building Madden with incredible new modes and components to it and a ton of fun. And then, we're pushing that into Ultimate Team as well. But, I think, people always need to understand the stability of our business is driven by this incredible machine that we've built around live services and the underlying strength of our portfolio and our long and large catalog. Andrew, I'll let you, jump in on the development. Yes. In terms of the expense side, it's really still early to tell. We know for the next, at least two quarters, the quarter we're in now and the following quarter, we will see virtually no travel and entertainment expenses that we would normally see. We're obviously -- both Gamescom and E3 have been canceled. Many of the industry events that typically would bring people together or our own internal events where we would have brought people together, were canceled. So, obviously, we'll see some savings there. We don't really have a full sense on what the future will bring a year from now. But I know we will think differently about how we operate, how many people we have in certain offices. What that looks like that could actually change expenses in the negative way. I hope not. I don't think that's what we're focused on. We hope that we are going actually have more people working from home that changes expenses to a positive. But, it's early days to say. But, I know at least in the near term, we will see some savings and we've tried to reflect that in some of our guidance. But, we don't really have a sense of how long this will go. We're currently working on plans as to how we would bring people back into offices and what the pace would be. We're not going to bring everybody back on day one, and I think most companies are going through the same thing. But, I do think in this year, we're probably in a better position for not having large OpEx, because we're not hiring as much, and we're not spending as much on things like travel, but I do think the unknown is really the following years going forward. Yes. Mike, it's hard to say. I mean, right now, we're working obviously, as we've talked about, with a lot of third-party companies for titles for the coming -- this year and following year. So, that's -- for us, we stay very close to them and we're doing everything possible we can to support those companies in a tough position. But, at the same time, companies that do have games in the market are obviously doing well, similar to what you're saying with us and other public companies. So, I don't know if it's turning a catalyst to M&A. We do feel like this will continue longer term to emphasize the fact that scale is incredibly important in this business. And maybe that turns into something which helps us with M&A going forward. Our model right now is really simple, which is stay close to all the companies we know. It's harder because you can't go meet with them face to face, but stay close to them on the phone, on Zoom, whatever it is, and make sure you're supportive, because we believe longer term that helps us potentially get a deeper partnership with them. And that's about all I can say now. And we'll see how that plays out over time. It's too early for us to be able to really assess any places where regulations have lifted, because I mean Shanghai is probably -- China is probably the only place we're starting to see that. So, it's early. I don't -- I think, you should assume our costs won't change versus what they've been historically. A real question is going to be do we benefit from slower hiring and less travel during the coming few quarters? And I think, we will, and that's built into our guidance. But, I don't have a sense of does that last another year or more. So, I think that will take some time for us to really better understand. And as both Andrew and I said on the call, our focus is on how do we hold together our team? We do not want to have to reduce what we believe is one of the greatest teams in the industry. And that's our number one focus. And I think everybody aligns with that. And they understand, okay, we will do everything we can to not spend, to make sure that that happens. In terms of the sports calendar, I mean, the biggest unknown for us right now is two things. The economy, what really happens to the economy over time? Today, we see our core audience spending because they're at home more. But, does that change over time? And then,, the second challenge is, what's the impact if the sports calendar does not start up at some period of time? We know today people are engaging with sports, because that's what they love to do. If you are a sports fair, it doesn't stop. And so, the only way they're getting their sports engagement is through our games. And that's a huge benefit for us. But we don't know, because there's no precedent on this is what happens long term, if any of the sports seasons get delayed even further. But, we do believe that everything we're seeing now and everything we're seeing, particularly in esports, is we can be a huge factor in helping people socialize and do what they love around the sport they love. And don't forget the social part, because remember, people don't sit and watch a sports game alone. They sit and watch a sports game and interact with all their friends that they know, engage in that sports. And what we're doing is we're enabling that to happen through our games and through the watching of esports online. So, we hope that that bodes for a great season going forward. But, we've never been in a time like this before. And so, that's why you're hearing any caution from us. Yes, sure. Thanks. Good questions. So, on live services, almost all of the delta was driven by Apex Legends. And remember, we came out of the gate last September -- or last February, excuse me, on fire, like you never would have believed, right? And so, the massive business. And then we've settled into a regular cadence and we've been able to grow that each quarter through all the seasons that we've had, and we're feeling very good about that. The second piece is, we -- as the sports calendar shut down, we made the decision to move the -- what is the -- let's call the first FUT birthday, FIFA Ultimate Team birthday event from the end of March into the first two weeks of April. And it was really driven by trying to pace out sports content, knowing that there was no sports content in the world. And so -- but it's one of the biggest events of the year. And so, you can imagine that also impacted the year as we went from Q4, compared to previous year Q4. Those were the two biggest drivers. On the positive side, Madden, both live service that Ultimate Team has been on fire, which in the February-March timeframe is rare, because it's post the Super Bowl, but it's been very strong. FIFA Online 4 in Korea was very strong. Remember, we -- I even said on the last earnings call, we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea. We're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China at this point. But, as we shut off FIFA Online 3 in Korea, we saw massive growth in FIFA Online 4. And so, that's kind of the puts and takes. And then, on top of that, I would say Sims 4 continues to be the title that just doesn't stop. And I guess, Andrew mentioned in his previous comments, it has continued to grow quarter-after-quarter after quarter. It is an incredible team and incredible product and amazing engagement. And so, you can say -- put it all on the Apex, last year, unbelievable benefit, and then the FIFA move of the FUT birthday in the quarter. Mobile, the way we've approached mobile for the year in terms of our guidance is we basically have assumed that mobile titles will stay in soft launch, much longer than they have historically. And so, we have relatively little new mobile growth from new products in the year. Our hope is, is that we can exceed that, but that's how we've built our guidance because we know the mobile industry continues to get harder and harder. And that means people are keeping mobile titles in soft launch for longer and longer to try to tune them. The good news is that we still have a strong set of mobile titles today that are highly profitable. You look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, for example, continues to perform extremely well, things like SimCity continued to perform extremely well. And while we're not growing dramatically, we're still extremely profitable across those titles. And our hope is the new titles that we have in the mix, will get out of soft launch faster than we anticipate and possibly help us generate something above what we forecast for the year. Yes. Andrew, do you want to start with the first one? Yes. And I'll try to address second part of your question. First, I would just remind everybody, which I think you all know, but, we've just finished a year in which we raised guidance three times and delivered on that with beats every time. We just put out guidance for next year, probably -- or this year, coming year that we're in right now in probably the most uncertain time that we've ever faced. And yet -- and we've cautioned everyone and we've put caveats on everything. And I don't know what's going to transpire. But, we were still willing to come out and put out guidance that we thought would grow both, top-line and bottom-line year-over-year. Look at Q1. The largest Q1 in the history of the company was $0.31 in EPS. And we just provided you guys for $0.70 in EPS. And the business could fall off the cliff tomorrow, and we would be dead wrong. But, I think all of you know how Andrew and I and all of our teams have been very conservative. I would think about that as you're thinking about the year forward. So with that wonderful syllabically [ph] or however you say that, we will end the call. And I appreciate everybody. And most important make sure your families are healthy, you're spending time with them, and you all stay healthy as well, because we need to have you guys around to help us in the marketplace. So, thank you."

It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts, with new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The Sims 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY 2020. What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great new games, our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry and we're expanding to more distribution channels, so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players, made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later, spanning all three trilogies and more, critics have re-reviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional and the Celebration Edition helped to drive performance at Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilm. It's nearly one year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season three was bigger than season two, with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY 2021 and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends global series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio. It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA Football brought an all new dimension to FIFA 20 and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3. FIFA 20 is also the number one most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch two major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with a prestigious South American club tournaments CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericana as well as the E-Libertadores a new expansion to our FIFA 20 global series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3. In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game Discover University continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community. As did the surprise addition of the child from the Mandalorian series on Disney+ just before the holidays. Meanwhile PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world. Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden to Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner in indie content and some more surprises to come. Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry it is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. With content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead. With the strength of our IP and live services we're well-positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on three major platforms and coming to Steam in FY 2021, we're expanding our leadership in high-value low friction subscriptions for more players. And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players, and continuing our growth into FY 2021. Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks Andrew. EA successfully launched three games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to eight. Launching eight major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons, and more driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan favorite reinforcements, exotic planets, and epic new ways to play across three cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched three seasons of content including three new legends, five in-game events, three town takeovers, and a whole new map of six new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company and the way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works; we had another great quarter with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months. EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that combined with a positive true-up this year creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our two-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game. Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio, with discounts smaller and applied later in the year. Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on the year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends, but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team. Growth in FIFA online in Asia was also extremely strong. Mobile delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales, plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital. Turning to guidance, we expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the two new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year with broad-based strength this year, offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability, even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across our broad range of genres. We're launching four sports titles including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises; four other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP and we'll also publish four titles globally from smaller developers. Finally we expect two new mobile titles to make it into soft launch. We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leveraged the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22 plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high quality entertainment for our players. Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks Blake. We're delivering for our players and our business is growing. Our foundation is great IP that excites and engages hundreds of millions of players. We've added the breadth and depth of our portfolio with great games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and the innovation in FIFA, Madden and our ongoing franchise is helping us reach new fans and grow our total player base. We're looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises, new IP, new partner indie titles and some other surprises in FY 2021 and beyond. Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead. Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to four franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors. We continue to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world. Now Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Thanks, gentlemen for taking the question. Looking at the past two Star Wars games, one was a massive multiplayer; one was obviously a big single player. Seems like sales numbers initially are roughly the same but one's got live services, one doesn't. How has that shaped the way you think about future game design as we head into the next console with a big focus on live services?\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play; inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement all these types of things. And as we start to look at the broader player base and we think about each of the cohorts within that we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand particularly with Star Wars is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction competition and multiplayer is really important for a large part of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is it also is that inspiration and escape model that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: And if I could just ask one follow-up. As we think about live services, but also more distribution channels more -- easier hopefully cheaper marketing. Should we expect EA to launch more than eight games when we look out three, four, five years or is kind of like is eight a good number?\nAndrew Wilson: I would start by saying eight is a lot. If you think about the various game launches across the industry, there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution. And so we feel really good about that number. The other thing that's important to understand is this also has a layering effect. So, as we launch games that have live services that last one, two, three, and in some cases, four and five years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think eight is probably a pretty good number. Some years there might be a few more of that, some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good. The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third-parties and Indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content. And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great high-quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry, we're also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third-party and Indie developers.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. And what I would add to Andrew's comment is remember one of the major strengths of our business is a deep catalog. And a deep catalog is based on not just this year's games or last year's games, but maybe even games from two or three or four years ago. And we sometimes see north of $1 billion in catalog sales in the following year. That's very powerful to us. It's very profitable. And it is critical in continuing to maintain the brands that we have built. And fans will come into games at many different levels either through direct purchase or through subscriptions. And that deep bench is something that creates a lot of value which I'm not sure people always think about as we're thinking about the value of the overall business.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thanks gentlemen and congrats on the quarter.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks.\nChris Evenden: Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatt Cost: Hi guys, it's Matt on for Brian. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the mobile business. It seems like you made some great progress, obviously, on constant currency growing year-on-year. Can you talk about sort of what you're seeing in that business and maybe any thoughts you're having on potentially partnering with other mobile app developers and some of your competitors have seen some success recently following the strategy like that particularly in terms of going in markets like Asia. And then if you could just quickly an update on Project Atlas? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. So, obviously, rolling mobile out in China, you need to have a partner. And we're -- as we've said in the prepared remarks today that we're working with a partner there and we're very excited about the opportunity. That partner is also helping us develop a mobile Apex for the globe. And -- well, more to come on that in terms of timing, but that's also a big upside for us. We have not built a lot into our forecast for next year on that, because the timing is always uncertain. But we do believe that there's a lot of opportunity there. Obviously, we'll also do a PC version of Apex in China through that same partner. But we will selectively use partners where possible. We have some great studios. We think we can continue to build great games. But where possible, where a partner can either increase the time to market, or help us in markets where we don't necessarily have the ability to go to market ourselves, like China, we will use partners. And more to come on Apex and any other titles that might fit in that.\nAndrew Wilson: Just a couple of other thoughts. We've talked in previous calls about kind of a three-pronged strategy around mobile, the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that may be some of the best-of-breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that. I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in an area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven't been as focused on. The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well. And then third, we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition. There's not a lot of those out there as it turns out, but we're trying to make sure that we're in every conversation. So we do -- mobile continues to be a focus for us and we do believe there's a growth opportunity ahead.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. On Project Atlas, the other part of your question, you'll continue to hear more from us about streaming and other components of Atlas. We're in tight connection and conversations with all of the players that are doing streaming. We're very excited about where it's going and the potential, as well as how we can continue to improve the tools that people use inside of the subscription models that we put in place. So a simple reminder, our goal is to be on every platform and to offer our great products to consumers, wherever they want to play them as long as we can play -- provide them at a quality level that we're comfortable with. So you're going to hear and see a lot more in the next coming year.\nMatt Cost: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.\nRaymond Stochel: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Is there anything that you can discuss as far as VOLTA. Can you give us an update on monetization for VOLTA. And then, any more details on FIFA Ultimate Team being up double digits this call. Is that like-for-like as far as first launch? And then, what would be driving that growth? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: We're very happy with VOLTA. VOLTA brought in a whole set of new players and engage them in new and interesting ways. As we've also talked about a lot in past calls, as we think about building live services, we really think about building engagement first and monetization to follow. As I say, I think that what the team did with VOLTA this year is really, really strong. They've taken some great learning from feedback they've received from the community and we'll continue to build on that in the years to come. And while we don't have any announcements yet on monetization, a lot of player feedback is that they would also like to see the opportunity to extend and enhance that VOLTA experience in a way they do with other live services. So we're excited about what that might bring.\nBlake Jorgensen: And what I would say on Ultimate Team and this is not just FIFA, this is Madden and this is NHL and our other games. The thing you need to remember on Ultimate Team is we continue to refine and improve the weekly or monthly events that we're running on Ultimate Team that bring people into play. People won't play Ultimate Team if they are not having fun. And so the key is how do you build an event that they're going to have fun competing and interacting. It's a social network and it's all about the design of events. And I think the team continues to get better and better every year either refining existing events or adding new events and that's what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports. And it's the thing that people sometimes don't understand when it comes to live services that it's not about the monetization. It's about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy that social connection and that competition with others. And that's what really drives that across all of our live services.\nChris Evenden: Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerrick Johnson: Hey, good afternoon. Two questions. First gross margin. Maybe you could provide us with the puts and takes, the bridge from last year to this year? And then also on the other titles that you did have guidance for, any update to that guidance for those titles? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. So gross margin's really simple. We sold more Madden, more FIFA and more Star Wars Jedi than we expected. And all three of those are royalty properties, so we had to pay royalty on them. Royalty gets booked in gross margin. That's a good problem to have. I'd take that all day long, because obviously it's driving the overall business and the profitability of the business. So nothing more than that. It's pretty straightforward. I don't think we have any new news on guidance for anything else. Obviously we've tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like. As I said in my prepared remarks, we would like to -- our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance and we think we've set up a slate of properties for next year to do that. And we've also provided people the knowledge that Battlefield's coming the year after that, which should also drive growth the following year. And we see that as a big positive for as we've said the continued plan to try to have a strong growth, top line bottom line cash flow as we go forward.\nGerrick Johnson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAlex Giaimo: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to dig into Apex aspirations a bit more without getting too bogged down into the F 2020 or F 2021 guide specifically how should investors be thinking broadly about the growth aspirations for that franchise. I think you've mentioned in the past that you view it as a 10-year franchise and it's obviously early, but should we think about it sort of as a modest straight-line grower moving forward or is it a bit more lumpy? And then just given the free-to-play nature of that game hoping you can just update us on how the profitability of Apex compares to the broader profitability of EA as a whole. Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, it's good questions. I mean as I think Andrew said we're just getting into our one-year anniversary in the game which is fantastic. We've been very pleased with where the game is. The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise. We will continue that journey no different than we've done with live services. You -- people sometimes forget Ultimate Team was like an $8 million business 12 years ago. And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business and that's how we're thinking about Apex. And we've continued to bolster the team with new talent, new live service talent, but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they're building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there. I mean it's just an incredible job they've done. It's hard for us to predict. If you would have asked us a month ago, six months ago, we probably wouldn't have known and we still don't know, but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain. But when we come to our May guidance, we'll try to give some people some sense of it. What we are -- we're going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I'm not sure what anyone can do with that information. And if anyone questions that I they go back seven and a half years ago to my very first quarter at the company where I said, we will take away metrics that don't make sense for investors. And we're not necessarily trying to hold back any information, we're not signaling anything. We just realized that we want to make sure you're not doing something with numbers that don't make sense. We'll try to give you as best guidance as we can. We want to grow the business. We think it's got a long history to it, but more to come and we're very excited and very optimistic about where the opportunities can go with Apex.\nAndrew Wilson: Just a small add. At a game level, as we look at the industry and the games that have actually lasted a decade or more, things like League of Legends, things like CS: Go, things like DOTA 2 to continue to engage huge populations of players around the world. There's really kind of three core pillars of those games; really compelling and identifiable characters, a truly compelling world, and competitive skill-based highly social game plan that continues to evolve and emerge over time as players continue to get better in the game. They are the three core tent poles of Apex Legends as again and as we think about the year -- the next year and the year after and we add new geographies and we had new platforms, again, as what Blake said, it's hard to predict exactly how that will grow, but our belief is that we have growth ahead and we're very, very encouraged and excited by the fact that the team gets better and better at answering needs of the players. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2. We expect Season 4 will grow again and we're excited about what will come. \nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. And you mentioned our comments in the past around, we're trying to build a long term franchise. At the end of the day, we would much rather have something that lasts for many, many years -- doesn't -- is not a boom and bust. And that's how we're trying to design the business. The team is very aligned with that. And if it can turn into essentially an annual shooter for us as part of our franchises. We think that's huge value to the overall company. So that's how we're looking at it and how we're approaching it. And we think everyone's aligned around that and more to come.\nAlex Giaimo: Thanks, guys.\nChris Evenden: Thanks. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Cohen with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJeff Cohen: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about how big of a driver Jedi: Fallen Order was for new subscribers to origin access? And then, broadly, just, can you talk about how churn has trended within your subscription products?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. So remember that it's the premier subscription that gets frontline titles. Which is only part of the overall origin access model and not in the Sony or Microsoft program. Obviously, it added to it, but its early days. So it's hard to understand if people came in and then went out, because they're still playing the game. We have not seen big changes in churn. It's been a big question for us, because we don't have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio. So you're always going to wonder about churn. But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that that will also bring people in. And the most important part is -- what we found out is, people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they joined the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription. And that's a huge win, as we start to build people into new, either games or genres or sports that they've never played before, because it only increases the growth of their interest in playing great games.\nJeff Cohen: Thanks, Blake. Congrats on the quarter.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Without getting into maybe any specific dates or even titles specifically, maybe to give us a little more update just on kind of how you're feeling about the pipeline, maybe, relative to where we were 6, 12 months ago that the products that are out there across the various studios. Any color there would be helpful. And then, just coming back to Sims and Apex in particular, Blake, I think, you had talked about those franchises doing, call it, $300 million to $400 million for the year. Are those still reasonable ending points for those franchises? Thanks, guys.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I would say, they're definitely reasonable franchise points for those franchises and both are doing -- continue to do well. The Sims added an expansion pack in the fall that has done extremely well. And it is just an amazing business that continues to grow, as more and more people come in. And then those people go backwards by expansion packs from history as well as by the new expansion packs and it just builds on that social network that we've effectively created inside The Sims. And we'll see similar behavior with Apex even though it's not expansion packs. More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network. No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year. Obviously next year we're going to -- we've said we'd most likely add at least one new sports game. And we have some third-party games we will have in for next year, and a couple of things that we haven't yet announced. But as we said earlier, we're very focused on growing both top line and bottom line both next year and the following year as well as future years. But I just want to give people a sense that we've got a fairly extensive set of titles that people should get pretty comfortable on going forward. And, obviously, we're also working on a lot of our famous franchises that will come in the future plus some continued new franchises that we'll continue to add and live services associated with all those.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Just as a kind of an add to that, again we benefit from a large number of very well-established studios with great teams with a track history of delivering really high-quality content. So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE and Respawn, and our EA SPORTS studios there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more. I also talked about a number of mobile titles, a couple of which will come in to soft launch next year. But I would tell you I'm more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years. And again I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it's very challenging. And all companies have discovered that. But I feel better about what I'm seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years. And so we feel very good about the long-term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. And you guys, kind of, imagine and you've seen this historically in console transitions. As new consoles come out -- I don't want to get ahead of our great partners Microsoft and Sony, but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles, which means a really simple thing, we can do a lot more. And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we're doing with games that will blow people's minds. And that's the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation, not just with us but across the whole industry. And that's why you've seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last what 20-plus years. And so that's where people sometimes get hung up. They get too focused on the short-term and not think about what's transpired historically. And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles, which means we can just do a lot more. And it's going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden, but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power.\nMatthew Thornton: Appreciate the color guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRyan Gee: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple on live services. So first very encouraged by the outperformance of Star Wars Jedi from Respawn. So, you guys now have a large player base into which you could generate some additional revenue. So, what is the opportunity ahead either for to generate live services revenue from that in fiscal 2022 and/or maybe some sort of add-on content pack for that game? And then as it relates to live services from Ultimate Team, the sequential acceleration to double-digits last quarter, are you guys able to see how much of that is a function of just easier year-over-year comps to the Ultimate Team business versus execution getting players further down the conversion funnel and getting higher spend out of existing payers. Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, let me hit the Ultimate Team one first and then maybe Andrew can address the Star Wars Jedi. Ultimate Team really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus once again trying to change the ARPU in some fashion. We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage them in better and more events that they're excited in. And so as I said earlier, the team has been very good at trying to design new events, add new events, and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event. And I think that's been our biggest single driver plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team. I mean we're -- more and more people play Ultimate Team and we think that's very engaging for them. But it's not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport. These are hard-core sports fans and this is what they want to do and that's why they engage in Ultimate Team.\nAndrew Wilson: On Star Wars, no announcements of anything at this point, but what I would say is you're right we have a very, very strong player base a very engaged player base who feel like what they've just had the ability to experience as one of the most compelling Star Wars experiences of their life of any formal media. I would also highlight it is a single-play game. So, any kind of live service or additional content would be different than what we would see in an Ultimate Team or an Apex Legends. But this team who is working on this is one of the most creative teams in our company and certainly in the industry who are thinking about where to take this journey next for players that love this style of play. We're excited by what we're going to come up with and in the meantime I also think that this will be one of the strongest catalog sellers for this company over the coming years and will almost certainly help continue to grow our subscription as it moves into our various subscription offers across platforms.\nChris Evenden: Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMario Lu: Hey guys. Two questions on my end. One on the Switch and one on Sims. So, Nintendo today announced that the Switch exceeded 52 million units shipped worldwide which is similar or more than the Xbox One. So, therefore, should we expect EA to publish more titles on the Switch going forward? As I understand currently there's only three EA titles on the platform including Unravel, Fe, in the legacy version of FIFA. And then secondly on The Sims, the success of Sims 4 is very intriguing to me since the industry is filled with multiplayer experiences. And Facebook recently actually announced that they're coming out with Horizons, a social experience in VR and that kind of reminds me of the Sims online which launched 18 years ago. So, any thoughts on relaunching an online version of the franchise, given its large popularity? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: So let me hit the Switch question and then I'll go into the AR question on Sims. So we are very pleased with how well the Nintendo has done with Switch. I mean, people love the platform. They enjoy it, it's great. And remember there are a lot of people that have both, the Xbox and a Switch or a PlayStation and Switch, because it, in many ways, provides a different experience, particularly a way to access great Nintendo software. We are always looking and discussing with Nintendo what else we can put on the platform. And as you can imagine, as the platform grows, our interest in adding content grows for that platform. But we're also conscious of the fact that the top-selling titles by a long shot or all the Nintendo software, which is fabulous software, but it helps us balance sort of the realities of how big our markets can be there. But trust that we're looking at that. You will hear some more things in the future about what we're putting on the platform. And we're very pleased with how it's grown alongside the growth of both Sony and Microsoft's platforms.\nAndrew Wilson: Great question on the Sims. A little known fact, I guess, for many -- the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally. As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier, inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these type and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition. But a few things are in fact true over the years. One is that, The Sims community has continued to grow. And with the broader social platforms continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast, not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes. And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self improvement, motivations, that this notion social interaction and competition, like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims Online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that, it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come.\nBlake Jorgensen: And the one thing that we have with The Sims, that we have with all of our games, but probably the most with the Sims is, its incredibly engaged community. And The Sims team has done an amazing job interacting with the community and trying to understand what they want. And so, it allows us to develop expansion packs, additions, whatever it is, or game approaches, that is really coming from the community and we will continue to encourage that. So as we see interest or demand that allows us to go chase that as we develop the product. And I think that's an amazing thing that you don't necessarily have in all games and The Sims is a leader there for us and it makes it such a fabulous opportunity to continue to feed what the community wants.\nMario Lu: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMike Ng: Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just had one on unit sales. If you look at full game downloads plus packaged goods, it looked like that was up $168 million year-on-year. And it seems like the key moving parts for Star Wars, Need for Speed more than offsetting Battlefield V. I was just wondering if there are any other factors to consider whether those were catalog sales being better or worse or pricing or the digital shift impacting unit sales that could help us think about things that may have impacted units for the quarter? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. Well, clearly digital sales continues to grow. I would -- I'd say remember Star Wars tends to skew a little lower digitally than our average titles just because a lot of the gifting that goes on at holidays. And live services, obviously, was a big driver. But if you thought -- if you think about our expectations as we mentioned we over delivered on Star Wars, we probably under delivered slightly on Plants vs. Zombies but that's one that will sell well over a long period of time. So in a relatively small title so that wasn't a big driver. And then Need for Speed's, kind of, as we expected. We did as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that this year we had stronger pricing than we have in the past and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past. And that was part of our strategy, but it also helped across the board as we look -- as you look at overall revenue.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDrew Crum: Thank you guys. Can you update us on the progress you've made with FIFA Online 4 in China during the current fiscal year, and how big of a role that plays growth for fiscal 2021? And when you get back to the $200 million annual run rate? And then separately with some of the management changes you've made at DICE and I guess specifically Vince becoming the Director of the LA office, how involved will he in Respawn be with the development of the next Battlefield game? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. So quickly on the on FIFA Online, we're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China. That has not impacted the business that much. In fact we're pretty close to getting back to our historical level. We've shut off FIFA Online in Korea. And FIFA Online 4 there has responded very well. We had strong growth year-over-year in the quarter for that and it was mainly driven by Korea. We will play it over the next few quarters as to when and how we're going to shut it down in China. But we're conscious that we don't want to disrupt the consumer there. And right now both Online 4 and Online 3 are doing well in that marketplace. So more to come on that. But we're pretty close to back to where we were and we're really excited about the growth that's coming off of FIFA Online 4 both in Southeast Asia and in Korea that we're seeing and even in China. So, more to come there, but that's kind of the quick answer.\nAndrew Wilson: Good question on Vince and Battlefield V. You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization. What this creative council does it kind of operates like a brain trust like was happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment, be constructive, and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on. And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that and that's having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this kind of aligned focused push against both quality and execution. With him taking on DICE LA, traditionally DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm, but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things and we're very excited about those things and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that. And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm, we've got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game. I'm really -- I talked about this last call. I'm really excited about what that team is doing. And David Rota who is leading the studios in Europe now is also having a really strong impact and the team is going to do some pretty amazing things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nMike Hickey: Hey Andrew, Blake, Chris congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on Vince that you kind of answered it, but maybe you can go a layer deeper. Obviously, he's a super talent to guy. I mean his success in the shooters truly genres is truly remarkable with Medal of Honor, Call of Duty: Titanfall, Apex Legends, obviously founded Respawn. I guess just your thoughts on Respawn ex-Vince how that studio continues to behave and the leadership there? And then at the new DICE studio, it sounds like they're going to rebrand that or rename it. You mentioned that perhaps he's inheriting some games in development, therapy development preproduction, but I'm curious if we can look forward to sort of AAA from Vince in the shooter genre emerging in two to three years. And then I guess broadly speaking new consoles, Blake, great to hear your excitement on new consoles coming to the market and what that means. I share that. It's also seemingly a good time to come out with new IP. So, thoughts, I guess, broadly on how you think about new IP on the front end to console cycle? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. Just to be clear Vince hasn't stopped working at Respawn. He's still running Respawn. We're asking him to do more and part of what Laura Miele has been doing is trying to make sure Vince has all the resources that he needs. And so giving him the chance to oversee DICE LA also gives them the opportunity to pull resources into the Respawn team if he needs to. So, there are probably, I don't know, how many new IP ideas we're incubating. So, more to come on all of that. Everyone's pretty excited. But I don't want anyone to be mistaken that expanding Vince's remit means in any way that he's not overseeing Respawn. He has got a great team there. He's got a great management team there. We continue to bolster that team. But he is still very helpful every day at Respawn as well as helpful across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about he and the whole team as to how they've integrated into the company. It's never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company. And I think what the Respawn team hopefully has found out is that, we're actually not bad guys and we're pretty fun to work with. Bad people, sorry, didn't mean to say bad guys, because Laura's a really good lady. But I just want people to know. I mean, we try to leverage -- and it's not just Vince, its people across our entire portfolio. We try to leverage our best sports experts, our best managers wherever they are. And that we've got a collection of quite a few of those people and that's what we can continue to produce the games that we produce every year. You don't put out the best of biggest sports games in the world year-after-year on time and on budget if you don't have amazing people doing that. And Chris is telling me I got it shut it off, because we're out of time. But there was one last -- one was one part of your question Mike that we didn't get to. We lost you. All right. All right, everyone. Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Talk to everyone next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew. EA successfully launched three games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to eight. Launching eight major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story. For example Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons, and more driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan favorite reinforcements, exotic planets, and epic new ways to play across three cinematic eras. For Apex Legends, we launched three seasons of content including three new legends, five in-game events, three town takeovers, and a whole new map of six new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company and the way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works; we had another great quarter with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular. Apex Legends is having a fantastic season and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months. EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance. The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that combined with a positive true-up this year creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our two-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind. Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game. Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio, with discounts smaller and applied later in the year. Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on the year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services and $993 million is an all-time high. Growth was led by Apex Legends, but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team. Growth in FIFA online in Asia was also extremely strong. Mobile delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia. Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales, plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital. Turning to guidance, we expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year. We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million. OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the two new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year with broad-based strength this year, offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability, even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across our broad range of genres. We're launching four sports titles including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises; four other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP and we'll also publish four titles globally from smaller developers. Finally we expect two new mobile titles to make it into soft launch. We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leveraged the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22 plus new and ongoing live services and other titles. We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high quality entertainment for our players. Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts. Yes. And what I would add to Andrew's comment is remember one of the major strengths of our business is a deep catalog. And a deep catalog is based on not just this year's games or last year's games, but maybe even games from two or three or four years ago. And we sometimes see north of $1 billion in catalog sales in the following year. That's very powerful to us. It's very profitable. And it is critical in continuing to maintain the brands that we have built. And fans will come into games at many different levels either through direct purchase or through subscriptions. And that deep bench is something that creates a lot of value which I'm not sure people always think about as we're thinking about the value of the overall business. Thanks. Yes. So, obviously, rolling mobile out in China, you need to have a partner. And we're -- as we've said in the prepared remarks today that we're working with a partner there and we're very excited about the opportunity. That partner is also helping us develop a mobile Apex for the globe. And -- well, more to come on that in terms of timing, but that's also a big upside for us. We have not built a lot into our forecast for next year on that, because the timing is always uncertain. But we do believe that there's a lot of opportunity there. Obviously, we'll also do a PC version of Apex in China through that same partner. But we will selectively use partners where possible. We have some great studios. We think we can continue to build great games. But where possible, where a partner can either increase the time to market, or help us in markets where we don't necessarily have the ability to go to market ourselves, like China, we will use partners. And more to come on Apex and any other titles that might fit in that. Yes. On Project Atlas, the other part of your question, you'll continue to hear more from us about streaming and other components of Atlas. We're in tight connection and conversations with all of the players that are doing streaming. We're very excited about where it's going and the potential, as well as how we can continue to improve the tools that people use inside of the subscription models that we put in place. So a simple reminder, our goal is to be on every platform and to offer our great products to consumers, wherever they want to play them as long as we can play -- provide them at a quality level that we're comfortable with. So you're going to hear and see a lot more in the next coming year. And what I would say on Ultimate Team and this is not just FIFA, this is Madden and this is NHL and our other games. The thing you need to remember on Ultimate Team is we continue to refine and improve the weekly or monthly events that we're running on Ultimate Team that bring people into play. People won't play Ultimate Team if they are not having fun. And so the key is how do you build an event that they're going to have fun competing and interacting. It's a social network and it's all about the design of events. And I think the team continues to get better and better every year either refining existing events or adding new events and that's what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports. And it's the thing that people sometimes don't understand when it comes to live services that it's not about the monetization. It's about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy that social connection and that competition with others. And that's what really drives that across all of our live services. Yeah. So gross margin's really simple. We sold more Madden, more FIFA and more Star Wars Jedi than we expected. And all three of those are royalty properties, so we had to pay royalty on them. Royalty gets booked in gross margin. That's a good problem to have. I'd take that all day long, because obviously it's driving the overall business and the profitability of the business. So nothing more than that. It's pretty straightforward. I don't think we have any new news on guidance for anything else. Obviously we've tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like. As I said in my prepared remarks, we would like to -- our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance and we think we've set up a slate of properties for next year to do that. And we've also provided people the knowledge that Battlefield's coming the year after that, which should also drive growth the following year. And we see that as a big positive for as we've said the continued plan to try to have a strong growth, top line bottom line cash flow as we go forward. Yes, it's good questions. I mean as I think Andrew said we're just getting into our one-year anniversary in the game which is fantastic. We've been very pleased with where the game is. The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise. We will continue that journey no different than we've done with live services. You -- people sometimes forget Ultimate Team was like an $8 million business 12 years ago. And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business and that's how we're thinking about Apex. And we've continued to bolster the team with new talent, new live service talent, but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they're building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there. I mean it's just an incredible job they've done. It's hard for us to predict. If you would have asked us a month ago, six months ago, we probably wouldn't have known and we still don't know, but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain. But when we come to our May guidance, we'll try to give some people some sense of it. What we are -- we're going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I'm not sure what anyone can do with that information. And if anyone questions that I they go back seven and a half years ago to my very first quarter at the company where I said, we will take away metrics that don't make sense for investors. And we're not necessarily trying to hold back any information, we're not signaling anything. We just realized that we want to make sure you're not doing something with numbers that don't make sense. We'll try to give you as best guidance as we can. We want to grow the business. We think it's got a long history to it, but more to come and we're very excited and very optimistic about where the opportunities can go with Apex. Yes. And you mentioned our comments in the past around, we're trying to build a long term franchise. At the end of the day, we would much rather have something that lasts for many, many years -- doesn't -- is not a boom and bust. And that's how we're trying to design the business. The team is very aligned with that. And if it can turn into essentially an annual shooter for us as part of our franchises. We think that's huge value to the overall company. So that's how we're looking at it and how we're approaching it. And we think everyone's aligned around that and more to come. Yes. So remember that it's the premier subscription that gets frontline titles. Which is only part of the overall origin access model and not in the Sony or Microsoft program. Obviously, it added to it, but its early days. So it's hard to understand if people came in and then went out, because they're still playing the game. We have not seen big changes in churn. It's been a big question for us, because we don't have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio. So you're always going to wonder about churn. But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners. And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that that will also bring people in. And the most important part is -- what we found out is, people actually come in for certain titles. We know this because we watch the data before they joined the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription. And that's a huge win, as we start to build people into new, either games or genres or sports that they've never played before, because it only increases the growth of their interest in playing great games. Thanks. Yes. I would say, they're definitely reasonable franchise points for those franchises and both are doing -- continue to do well. The Sims added an expansion pack in the fall that has done extremely well. And it is just an amazing business that continues to grow, as more and more people come in. And then those people go backwards by expansion packs from history as well as by the new expansion packs and it just builds on that social network that we've effectively created inside The Sims. And we'll see similar behavior with Apex even though it's not expansion packs. More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network. No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year. Obviously next year we're going to -- we've said we'd most likely add at least one new sports game. And we have some third-party games we will have in for next year, and a couple of things that we haven't yet announced. But as we said earlier, we're very focused on growing both top line and bottom line both next year and the following year as well as future years. But I just want to give people a sense that we've got a fairly extensive set of titles that people should get pretty comfortable on going forward. And, obviously, we're also working on a lot of our famous franchises that will come in the future plus some continued new franchises that we'll continue to add and live services associated with all those. Yeah. And you guys, kind of, imagine and you've seen this historically in console transitions. As new consoles come out -- I don't want to get ahead of our great partners Microsoft and Sony, but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles, which means a really simple thing, we can do a lot more. And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we're doing with games that will blow people's minds. And that's the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation, not just with us but across the whole industry. And that's why you've seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last what 20-plus years. And so that's where people sometimes get hung up. They get too focused on the short-term and not think about what's transpired historically. And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles, which means we can just do a lot more. And it's going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden, but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power. Yes, let me hit the Ultimate Team one first and then maybe Andrew can address the Star Wars Jedi. Ultimate Team really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus once again trying to change the ARPU in some fashion. We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage them in better and more events that they're excited in. And so as I said earlier, the team has been very good at trying to design new events, add new events, and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event. And I think that's been our biggest single driver plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team. I mean we're -- more and more people play Ultimate Team and we think that's very engaging for them. But it's not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport. These are hard-core sports fans and this is what they want to do and that's why they engage in Ultimate Team. So let me hit the Switch question and then I'll go into the AR question on Sims. So we are very pleased with how well the Nintendo has done with Switch. I mean, people love the platform. They enjoy it, it's great. And remember there are a lot of people that have both, the Xbox and a Switch or a PlayStation and Switch, because it, in many ways, provides a different experience, particularly a way to access great Nintendo software. We are always looking and discussing with Nintendo what else we can put on the platform. And as you can imagine, as the platform grows, our interest in adding content grows for that platform. But we're also conscious of the fact that the top-selling titles by a long shot or all the Nintendo software, which is fabulous software, but it helps us balance sort of the realities of how big our markets can be there. But trust that we're looking at that. You will hear some more things in the future about what we're putting on the platform. And we're very pleased with how it's grown alongside the growth of both Sony and Microsoft's platforms. And the one thing that we have with The Sims, that we have with all of our games, but probably the most with the Sims is, its incredibly engaged community. And The Sims team has done an amazing job interacting with the community and trying to understand what they want. And so, it allows us to develop expansion packs, additions, whatever it is, or game approaches, that is really coming from the community and we will continue to encourage that. So as we see interest or demand that allows us to go chase that as we develop the product. And I think that's an amazing thing that you don't necessarily have in all games and The Sims is a leader there for us and it makes it such a fabulous opportunity to continue to feed what the community wants. Yeah. Well, clearly digital sales continues to grow. I would -- I'd say remember Star Wars tends to skew a little lower digitally than our average titles just because a lot of the gifting that goes on at holidays. And live services, obviously, was a big driver. But if you thought -- if you think about our expectations as we mentioned we over delivered on Star Wars, we probably under delivered slightly on Plants vs. Zombies but that's one that will sell well over a long period of time. So in a relatively small title so that wasn't a big driver. And then Need for Speed's, kind of, as we expected. We did as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that this year we had stronger pricing than we have in the past and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past. And that was part of our strategy, but it also helped across the board as we look -- as you look at overall revenue. Yeah. So quickly on the on FIFA Online, we're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China. That has not impacted the business that much. In fact we're pretty close to getting back to our historical level. We've shut off FIFA Online in Korea. And FIFA Online 4 there has responded very well. We had strong growth year-over-year in the quarter for that and it was mainly driven by Korea. We will play it over the next few quarters as to when and how we're going to shut it down in China. But we're conscious that we don't want to disrupt the consumer there. And right now both Online 4 and Online 3 are doing well in that marketplace. So more to come on that. But we're pretty close to back to where we were and we're really excited about the growth that's coming off of FIFA Online 4 both in Southeast Asia and in Korea that we're seeing and even in China. So, more to come there, but that's kind of the quick answer. Yes. Just to be clear Vince hasn't stopped working at Respawn. He's still running Respawn. We're asking him to do more and part of what Laura Miele has been doing is trying to make sure Vince has all the resources that he needs. And so giving him the chance to oversee DICE LA also gives them the opportunity to pull resources into the Respawn team if he needs to. So, there are probably, I don't know, how many new IP ideas we're incubating. So, more to come on all of that. Everyone's pretty excited. But I don't want anyone to be mistaken that expanding Vince's remit means in any way that he's not overseeing Respawn. He has got a great team there. He's got a great management team there. We continue to bolster that team. But he is still very helpful every day at Respawn as well as helpful across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about he and the whole team as to how they've integrated into the company. It's never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company. And I think what the Respawn team hopefully has found out is that, we're actually not bad guys and we're pretty fun to work with. Bad people, sorry, didn't mean to say bad guys, because Laura's a really good lady. But I just want people to know. I mean, we try to leverage -- and it's not just Vince, its people across our entire portfolio. We try to leverage our best sports experts, our best managers wherever they are. And that we've got a collection of quite a few of those people and that's what we can continue to produce the games that we produce every year. You don't put out the best of biggest sports games in the world year-after-year on time and on budget if you don't have amazing people doing that. And Chris is telling me I got it shut it off, because we're out of time. But there was one last -- one was one part of your question Mike that we didn't get to. We lost you. All right. All right, everyone. Thank you. Talk to everyone next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts, with new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The Sims 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season. As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY 2020. What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great new games, our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry and we're expanding to more distribution channels, so we can connect more players to the games they love. As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season. Respawn delivered an expertly crafted high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players, made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well. Two years and dozens of content updates later, spanning all three trilogies and more, critics have re-reviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional and the Celebration Edition helped to drive performance at Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations. Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilm. It's nearly one year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community. Season three was bigger than season two, with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience. We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY 2021 and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends global series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio. It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter. Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA Football brought an all new dimension to FIFA 20 and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3. FIFA 20 is also the number one most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch two major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with a prestigious South American club tournaments CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericana as well as the E-Libertadores a new expansion to our FIFA 20 global series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3. In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game Discover University continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community. As did the surprise addition of the child from the Mandalorian series on Disney+ just before the holidays. Meanwhile PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world. Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players. From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden to Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner in indie content and some more surprises to come. Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry it is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. With content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead. With the strength of our IP and live services we're well-positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China. With our subscription services now available on three major platforms and coming to Steam in FY 2021, we're expanding our leadership in high-value low friction subscriptions for more players. And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players, and continuing our growth into FY 2021. Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Thanks Blake. We're delivering for our players and our business is growing. Our foundation is great IP that excites and engages hundreds of millions of players. We've added the breadth and depth of our portfolio with great games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and the innovation in FIFA, Madden and our ongoing franchise is helping us reach new fans and grow our total player base. We're looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises, new IP, new partner indie titles and some other surprises in FY 2021 and beyond. Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead. Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to four franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors. We continue to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Great question. And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play; inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement all these types of things. And as we start to look at the broader player base and we think about each of the cohorts within that we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand particularly with Star Wars is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction competition and multiplayer is really important for a large part of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is it also is that inspiration and escape model that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base. I would start by saying eight is a lot. If you think about the various game launches across the industry, there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution. And so we feel really good about that number. The other thing that's important to understand is this also has a layering effect. So, as we launch games that have live services that last one, two, three, and in some cases, four and five years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think eight is probably a pretty good number. Some years there might be a few more of that, some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good. The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third-parties and Indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content. And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great high-quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry, we're also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third-party and Indie developers. Just a couple of other thoughts. We've talked in previous calls about kind of a three-pronged strategy around mobile, the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that may be some of the best-of-breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that. I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in an area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven't been as focused on. The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well. And then third, we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition. There's not a lot of those out there as it turns out, but we're trying to make sure that we're in every conversation. So we do -- mobile continues to be a focus for us and we do believe there's a growth opportunity ahead. We're very happy with VOLTA. VOLTA brought in a whole set of new players and engage them in new and interesting ways. As we've also talked about a lot in past calls, as we think about building live services, we really think about building engagement first and monetization to follow. As I say, I think that what the team did with VOLTA this year is really, really strong. They've taken some great learning from feedback they've received from the community and we'll continue to build on that in the years to come. And while we don't have any announcements yet on monetization, a lot of player feedback is that they would also like to see the opportunity to extend and enhance that VOLTA experience in a way they do with other live services. So we're excited about what that might bring. Just a small add. At a game level, as we look at the industry and the games that have actually lasted a decade or more, things like League of Legends, things like CS: Go, things like DOTA 2 to continue to engage huge populations of players around the world. There's really kind of three core pillars of those games; really compelling and identifiable characters, a truly compelling world, and competitive skill-based highly social game plan that continues to evolve and emerge over time as players continue to get better in the game. They are the three core tent poles of Apex Legends as again and as we think about the year -- the next year and the year after and we add new geographies and we had new platforms, again, as what Blake said, it's hard to predict exactly how that will grow, but our belief is that we have growth ahead and we're very, very encouraged and excited by the fact that the team gets better and better at answering needs of the players. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2. We expect Season 4 will grow again and we're excited about what will come. Yeah. Just as a kind of an add to that, again we benefit from a large number of very well-established studios with great teams with a track history of delivering really high-quality content. So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE and Respawn, and our EA SPORTS studios there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more. I also talked about a number of mobile titles, a couple of which will come in to soft launch next year. But I would tell you I'm more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years. And again I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it's very challenging. And all companies have discovered that. But I feel better about what I'm seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years. And so we feel very good about the long-term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline. On Star Wars, no announcements of anything at this point, but what I would say is you're right we have a very, very strong player base a very engaged player base who feel like what they've just had the ability to experience as one of the most compelling Star Wars experiences of their life of any formal media. I would also highlight it is a single-play game. So, any kind of live service or additional content would be different than what we would see in an Ultimate Team or an Apex Legends. But this team who is working on this is one of the most creative teams in our company and certainly in the industry who are thinking about where to take this journey next for players that love this style of play. We're excited by what we're going to come up with and in the meantime I also think that this will be one of the strongest catalog sellers for this company over the coming years and will almost certainly help continue to grow our subscription as it moves into our various subscription offers across platforms. Great question on the Sims. A little known fact, I guess, for many -- the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally. As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier, inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these type and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition. But a few things are in fact true over the years. One is that, The Sims community has continued to grow. And with the broader social platforms continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us. And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast, not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes. And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self improvement, motivations, that this notion social interaction and competition, like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims Online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come. We're very excited. This is a game that, it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come. Good question on Vince and Battlefield V. You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization. What this creative council does it kind of operates like a brain trust like was happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment, be constructive, and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on. And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that and that's having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this kind of aligned focused push against both quality and execution. With him taking on DICE LA, traditionally DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm, but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things and we're very excited about those things and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that. And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm, we've got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game. I'm really -- I talked about this last call. I'm really excited about what that team is doing. And David Rota who is leading the studios in Europe now is also having a really strong impact and the team is going to do some pretty amazing things. Thank you."

We continued a strong FY '20 with an excellent second quarter. Our latest EA SPORTS titles are captivating a growing global player base, and deep engagement in these titles and our ongoing live services fueled our continued momentum through Q2. As a result, our revenue and earnings per share exceeded our expectations for Q2, and we are raising our full year guidance today. At Electronic Arts, we are focused on creating amazing new games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and reaching more players when and where they want to play. I\u2019ll share a few highlights here of how we delivered against these focus areas during Q2. First, let\u2019s cover our new games. EA SPORTS is innovating for a growing audience of fans. Madden NFL 20 is off to an outstanding start, growing year-over-year in player engagement, units sold and Ultimate Team. The excellent core gameplay and fresh new experiences in franchise mode are delivering for our loyal fans, while Superstar X-Factors and the all-new Superstar KO mode are resonating with a broader football community. With a launch that began earlier in the preseason and a second major beat at the NFL Kickoff weekend that brought more players into the game, we\u2019ve delivered growth across the board in Madden. Unique players were up 12% year-over-year in Q2, games played in franchise mode more than doubled to over 100 million in the same period, and Madden Ultimate Team unique players are up nearly 20% year over-year. Our Madden competitive gaming season has kicked off as well. Our major tournaments are aligned to key moments in the NFL season, we have a groundbreaking virtual stadium rights partner, and other major brands are partnering with us throughout the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. The innovation in FIFA 20 is also deeply engaging fans and bringing new players into the franchise. Total players in FIFA were up nearly 15% year-over-year in Q2, and with the addition of the VOLTA Football street soccer experience, new-to-franchise players have grown 7% year over-year. Enhancements to the core gameplay and Ultimate Team are also re-engaging more franchise veterans, with unique players in FIFA Ultimate Team growing 22% over last year. People are playing more FIFA than ever before, with total in-game matches up more than 30% year-over-year. And as players continue to engage in the FIFA 20 experience and Ultimate Team, our FIFA 20 Global Series is kicking off in November, with millions set to compete in our unparalleled nine-month worldwide esports competition. Last season, more than 800 million minutes of FIFA esports content were watched, and with sponsors like Adidas and others breaking new ground with us this year, we\u2019re excited to reach an expanding audience with more great content. We also saw growth across our broader EA SPORTS portfolio. With innovations in NHL 20 delivering for hockey fans, Hockey Ultimate Team grew year-over-year in Q2. FIFA Online in Korea had some of our strongest-ever months on PC, and we\u2019re also seeing growth in China. FIFA Mobile has now been downloaded more than 250 million times life to date, following the launch of our latest season that includes 650 new in-game events. It was a very strong Q2 for EA SPORTS, and we\u2019re excited to build on that momentum throughout FY20. Q2 also showed the strength of our ongoing live services. In Apex Legends, we continue to deepen our long-term investment in the game and its community. With each successive season of new content, we are building, adding to the experience, and learning. For the first season in March, we launched the Battle Pass, and began the regular introduction of new legends. In the second season in July, we brought more content, a map update, ranked leagues and larger events. The third season, which launched in October, is our biggest yet with an entirely new map, amazing events like the Halloween-themed content in the game now, and much more to come. Weekly average player peaks in Season Three are significantly above our Season Two peaks, and we\u2019re continuing to bring more new players into the game. Apex Legends is a major long term franchise for us. Since launch, we\u2019ve significantly expanded the team working on the game, and it continues to grow. Our pipeline of future content is packed with really fun experiences that will be delivered through upcoming seasons and a regular cadence of updates for the community. With the Apex Legends community now growing past 70 million players, we\u2019re focused on expanding to mobile, new platforms and new geographies, as well as launching an Apex competitive gaming program that we\u2019ll share details on soon. The Sims 4 also continues to be an incredible long-term live service with a growing audience. Monthly average players are up more than 40% year-over-year in The Sims 4, and engagement across the franchise has led The Sims to surpass $5 billion in lifetime sales. The Sims continues to be one of the great franchises in gaming, and we have plans to bring new experiences to its amazing players for a long time to come. We are also reaching new milestones as we seek to bring great games and services to more players on more platforms. The launch of EA Access on PlayStation 4 significantly grew our subscriber base through the course of Q2. We also announced this morning our plans to bring EA Access to Steam on PC, adding a fourth platform where players will be able to connect and get the benefits and value of our subscription service. This is a unique and exciting partnership with Valve that will enable us to bring PC players in the Steam and Origin communities together. Helping more players connect to our games whenever and wherever they want to play will be a continuing focus for us. We look forward to sharing more announcements about other platforms in the coming months. For our holiday quarter of FY '20, we\u2019re delivering great new games and content across our portfolio. First, the irreverent new Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville launched two weeks ago to praise from fans and critics, and we\u2019re looking forward to the holidays for this family-friendly game. In early November, Need for Speed Heat arrives for racing fans, blending street racing by day and underground racing by night, all with the deep customization that fans expect. Players have been getting primed through the Need for Speed Heat Studio mobile app launched this summer, where they have already customized more than 7 million cars, which can be loaded straight into the game at launch. Then, on November 15, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order arrives worldwide. This game is coming to market at such an amazing time. From the launch of Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge at Disney theme parks; to the upcoming Disney+ series The Mandalorian; to ongoing games like Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront II, and The Old Republic; to the culmination of the Skywalker saga in the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, this is a year unlike any other for hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans out there. The one fantasy that many of those fans have been telling us they want is to experience the journey of becoming a Jedi and we\u2019re set to deliver that with Jedi: Fallen Order. The Respawn team have been pouring their passion into creating this new game in partnership with Lucasfilm, with characters old and new, and a story that is now an authentic part of the Star Wars universe. It\u2019s going to be a thrilling adventure to play, and with more than 140 million views to date of trailers and videos for the game, the community is eager to jump into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in just a few more weeks. The holidays will also be a busy season for players in our live services. Our Battlefield V players will be able to jump into the expansive new Pacific theater, a major addition to the game that includes new factions, maps, weapons and vehicles, starting two days from now. And in Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS franchises, The Sims 4, Anthem and Star Wars Battlefront II, our communities will all have new content and new experiences to dive into during the holiday quarter. Looking farther ahead, I want to share a few thoughts on FY \u201821 and our plans for the continued growth of Electronic Arts. We reach a massive global audience of players with our games today, and we have a core business fueled by live services that continues to grow. Next year, we will build on that with a full slate of new EA SPORTS experiences, including new titles that we are adding to our sports portfolio. New consoles are always an opportunity to drive more innovation in our EA SPORTS games, as our fans are eager to begin experiencing a new generation of play. That will include our plans for NBA LIVE. With great support from the NBA and NBA Players Association, we had been working on an innovative new direction for our game timed with the All-Star weekend, an experience designed around new ways for players to engage, connect and create through basketball. Now, with greater understanding of the new platforms and what they can power, bringing social connection, accessibility, and player creativity to the forefront, we feel we can go so much further with the new design. So we\u2019ve decided not to ship an NBA LIVE game in FY '20. Instead, we\u2019re expanding our vision for NBA LIVE, and continuing to work closely with our NBA and NB Players Association partners on this new project that we\u2019ll share more details on next year. Our live services will continue to grow and enhance the experience in our major franchises. We\u2019re expanding our Apex Legends team to deliver our content plans for FY '21, and we will reach new audiences through mobile and across Asia. We have ongoing growth expectations for The Sims 4, with new expansions and all-new ways to engage and grow the community. Our Battlefield franchise and its community are also a major focus for us, and we\u2019ll add new content and new ways to play Battlefield V in FY '21. Targeting new innovation that will be enabled by next-gen platforms and a growing install base on the new consoles, our next Battlefield game is set for FY '22. We also have plans for new experiences that we\u2019ve not yet announced for next year, new titles and new IP for multiple platforms. Introducing new games will always be at our core, and we look forward to exciting players with unexpected new titles in FY21. We will also be driving new opportunities to connect with more players through expansion our subscription services, new platforms, cloud gaming, and more. We\u2019re confident in the continued growth of our business at Electronic Arts through FY '20, FY '21 and beyond. We have a big holiday quarter ahead of us, and we\u2019re excited to continue a strong year. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. The strong results this quarter illustrate the power of our focus on live services and on our core franchises. Games are evolving, and the way people play them is changing. We had great launches for FIFA and Madden, and the quarter\u2019s story is dominated by live services that engage players over extended periods of time. Live services strength in Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Apex Legends and FIFA Online drove performance significantly above last year. I\u2019ll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter\u2019s results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA\u2019s net revenue was $1.348 billion, above our guidance by $33 million. Operating expenses were $675 million, $4 million lower than our guidance. GAAP operating income was $268 million, compared to an operating income of $258 million a year ago, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.89, $0.29 better than our guidance. As a reminder, $2.11 of our earnings was driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. Underlying profit was much stronger than we had expected, driven by increased sales, lower operating expenses and a richer digital mix. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $37 million, up $163 million from last year. The increase was driven primarily by higher profit and faster collections. Operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months was $1.748 billion, $290 million above last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $27 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $10 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.3 million shares at a cost of $306 million, leaving $674 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.9 billion. Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.277 billion, up $55 million on the prior year, and $47 million above our guidance. Performance over guidance was driven by broad strength across our portfolio with notable growth in live services. Digital net bookings were $790 million, up 24% on the year-ago period, and a new record for the second quarter, driven by growth across our numerous live services offerings as well as an increase in full-game digital downloads. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing twelve-month basis, compared to 69% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter\u2019s digital net bookings in turn, Live services net bookings were up 50% year-on-year, to $493 million, another new Q2 record. The increase was driven by Apex Legends, Ultimate Team, in Madden, FIFA and NHL, The Sims 4, and FIFA Online, partially offset by the tail of Battlefield 1 DLC. EA Access is off to a great start on PlayStation. Ultimate Team net bookings grew strongly year-on-year for both Madden and FIFA. Even adjusting for the fact that Madden had an extra week in the quarter, and both Madden and FIFA benefitted from early access sales on PlayStation through EA Access, both were up double-digit percentages over last year. Notably, given that we launched VOLTA Football in FIFA 20 and it immediately became the number 2 mode in the game, behind only Ultimate Team, weekly average users for FIFA Ultimate Team still grew 15% year-on-year. Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 20% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. The segment outperformed our expectations, driven by new content in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. FIFA Mobile China, FIFA Online 4 Mobile, Madden Mobile and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes all grew this quarter, and, subsequent to quarter end, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes had its second-biggest day ever. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $175 million, 11% higher than last year, another Q2 record. The digital portion of Madden sales increased 9 percentage points year-on-year, to 51%. FIFA launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first 3 weeks of sales, it was about 34% digital, up from 29% in the comparable period for FIFA 19. Overall, 50% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the 12 months to September 30. This compares to just 42% a year ago. Turning to guidance. Our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is $5.410 billion, and earnings per share of $9.57. As a reminder, $5.74 of this is driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.625 billion, $50 million above our prior expectations. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.50 billion. With regards to business drivers, we have raised our net bookings outlook for the year to $5.125 billion. Live services remain strong, and we continue to expect Apex Legends and The Sims to both deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We\u2019re not passing through the full beat, primarily as the FX headwind has increased significantly and we have pushed NBA Live 20 and Respawn\u2019s VR Medal of Honor title out of the year. Together, these headwinds amount to approximately $100 million against our original expectations for net bookings. For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.51 billion, cost of revenue to be $482 million, and operating expenses of $733 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, driven by the negative adjustment to variable compensation a year ago. This results in earnings per share of $0.92 for the third quarter using the diluted share count of 295 million. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.94 billion. This is up 21% year-on-year, driven by live services, particularly Apex Legends and Ultimate Team, and because we have two launches in the quarter this year, versus one last year. We released the launch trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order this morning, and early reaction appears extremely positive. We\u2019re excited to bring this action title to Star Wars fans on November 15, and continue to model sales in the range of 6 to 8 million units. We are modelling Need For Speed Heat to perform similarly to previous titles in that franchise, with unit sales of 3 to 4 million units. Looking further ahead, I\u2019d like to expand on the view Andrew gave you into our fiscal 2021 slate. We\u2019re doubling down on live services combined with our core franchises. We\u2019re investing in Apex Legends as our shooter in fiscal 2021. We expect to drive growth in all of our major live services next year, including Ultimate Team, Apex Legends, FIFA Online and The Sims. We will continue to grow our subscription business. We believe Apex growth will be driven in part by the continued expansion of content and by the launch of the service on new platforms, geographies and on mobile. As Andrew noted, the Sims is now a $5 billion franchise for us, and it continues to grow, driven by new content and new platforms. Mobile growth will be driven by the ramp of our new Plants vs. Zombies title, sports on mobile, including FIFA Mobile in Asia, and Apex Legends, offset by aging titles elsewhere in our portfolio. With regards to product launches in fiscal 2021, we will add at least one more sports title to our annual slate. We will launch Medal of Honor VR. We\u2019ll deliver some exciting remasters of fan favorites, including the Command & Conquer game we\u2019ve already disclosed. And we have two new unannounced EA Partners titles coming from third-party developers. In addition, we have other unannounced titles in the FY21 slate, we will give specifics nearer the time. Overall, we expect to drive growth in net bookings and underlying profits for fiscal 2021. We will provide formal guidance on our Q4 call as usual. Growth in fiscal 2022 will be led by a new and very exciting Battlefield title. I introduced the quarter by discussing how player preferences have changed the way we build and deliver games. We\u2019re investing in games that people play for longer and engage with much more deeply. For example, the number of matches played in FIFA per player has grown nearly 10% year-on-year, and we expect VOLTA to grow that still further. Similarly, the time spent playing matches in Madden NFL 20 is up by about one third. We expect this strategy and focus will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company through the remainder of this year and beyond. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks Blake. It is a great time to be part of the interactive entertainment industry. The excitement throughout the community for new experiences and innovation shows how games more than any other form of entertainment can bring people together. Billions of people, from every corner of the world, bring their passion to play, connect, compete, and share through games. Making that possible is what drives every single one of us at Electronic Arts. Amazing games are the very core of our business growth. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio of games across genres, fulfilling a breadth of motivations for our players. From escape in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, to competition though EA SPORTS, to social connection in Battlefield V, and more. Creativity fuels our future, and our studios have many more new experiences in development. New IP at Motive, new projects at DICE, Bioware, Maxis and Criterion, new mobile titles, new titles for EA SPORTS, new indie and third-party developer titles, all that will continue to excite and grow our global audience. Live services extend and enhance the experience of those games. Apex Legends, FIFA, The Sims 4, Galaxy of Heroes and more of our top franchises have thriving global communities spanning hundreds of millions of players. We\u2019ve been pioneers in this space, building on years of expertise and success to deliver continuously evolving experiences fueled by new content, in game events, and fan-requested updates. Competitive gaming adds another dimension to the experience to play and watch, and we\u2019re building on our strength here with more of our franchises set to enter esports in the coming months. As players around the world play their favorite games for longer periods of time, robust live services will continue to be vital to the experience, and a growth driver for our business. Reaching more players on more platforms is also a key driver for us. New consoles, cloud gaming, and more platform choices will continue to expand the addressable audience. We\u2019re thrilled to be bringing the EA and Steam communities together through the EA Access subscription, and we\u2019re working to reach more platforms in the near future. As cloud gaming continues to develop, through Project Atlas we are testing games streamed on public cloud infrastructure to ensure we are at the forefront of this developing space. We\u2019re also very excited to continue working with our first-party partners on their new platforms, where we\u2019ll be well positioned to deliver some outstanding new experiences beginning next year. With some of the most talented, creative and passionate teams in the industry, we are building momentum. Our focus on making great games and live services for more players around the world has never been stronger. Now Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. On the live services commentary, just want to make sure we are understanding the key messages on how much of the doubling down on live services has to do with existing franchises, which is how we should think about the key to investment and make against new franchises where you see pockets of the industry where you can extend into live services and broaden out the portfolio looking out over the next couple years? That's number one. And, Andrew, you're coming on EA SPORTS, I'm just curious what you mean by the potential to broaden out the portfolio there as well. We saw a headline today about the MCAA and possible compensation of athlete. That's an area where you guys have historically had some success going back to football title from years ago. How should we think about the opportunity around broadening out EA SPORTS as well? Thanks so much, guys.\nBlake Jorgensen: So let me take live server one first, Eric. You know, we have invested heavily in live services over the past 10 years. Obviously, we're seeing the benefits of that today with titles like Ultimate Team across all our sports and The Sims, obviously Apex is a new live service which we will invest heavily in to try to continue to grow that business. We view that as an annual shooter franchise effectively. And we're trying to build that as a 10 year business not one year or two year business. And we're very excited about the roadmap that the response team has put in place. Beyond that, obviously FIFA Online in Asia is critical. We're announcing as we move from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4 in Korea rapid growth. We're still operating both platforms online 3, and online 4 in China and over time, we'll move to a single platform there. But we feel like we're out of the woods on the bad comp from last year and so we're starting to see good growth there. And we're looking at how do we extend live services across every single one of our titles that can be as successful or more successful than what we see on our sports titles and The Sims and Apex. That includes titles like Battlefield titles, the action game like Anthem and you\u2019ll continue to see improvements across that and we\u2019re excited about where that can go. It is how people want to play games. It is where we think we have a skillset that is different than many of the other game companies and we think we can continue to be very successful there.\nAndrew Wilson: On the EA\u2019s SPORTS point, there are a number of EA SPORTS games that we\u2019ve worked on or developed or published over the years. Some of those sports, we\u2019re seeing strong resurgence and strong growth, and we\u2019re investing back in. It\u2019s an area of key strength for us as a business, and EA SPORTS teams have demonstrated an ability to truly engage a global population of sports fans. With respect to NCAA Sports in general, yes, we have been in that business before as well. We saw the news today as did you, we had fed into the NCAA Working Group. That news today was new to us. We\u2019re still digesting it. We would anticipate that there is still a number of things that would have to happen over the coming years before we will be able to get back into that business, but certainly we\u2019re watching closely.\nChris Evenden: Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray.\nMichael Olson: Hey, good afternoon. So, you guys talked a lot about what\u2019s coming into fiscal \u201821. I thought it might just be helpful to summarize fiscal \u201821 and how you kind of comp incremental titles launching fiscal \u201820. So, just kind of rattling through it, growth for Apex Legends, FIFA Online in Asia will grow Ultimate Team for both Madden and FIFA grow, Sims I\u2019m not sure if you were implying growth or not, a new sports title, Command & Conquer, NBA Live, VR, two new partner titles and maybe a couple of other titles that you can announce right now. Is that sound correct or was there anything I missed regarding?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, no, we were implying growth for Sims as well. We\u2019ve continued to grow that title every year for that since it was shipped what seven years ago and we feel that continues on. They\u2019ve got a really robust plan for continued growth. And there may be some other re-masters that we do along the Command & Conquer line that we just haven\u2019t announced yet. But that \u2013 we believe all that yield is pretty exciting fiscal 2021. And effectively, what we\u2019re doing is giving you some guidance on fiscal 2022, knowing that the Battlefield is coming then. And remember, the goal of Battlefield for 2022 is to really take advantage of a larger installed base of the new console. Bringing out Battlefield next year, where the new console base is fairly small, doesn\u2019t really give justice to the potential of the title. And so that\u2019s part of our driver and moving the title into fiscal 2022. So, think about it as multiyear growth model that we just tried to lay out for people, and we\u2019re pretty excited about it.\nMichael Olson: Okay. And then just to follow-up on that. It sounds like you\u2019re implying Apex Legends will grow and still kind of some of the whole that not having the Battlefield will create. I know it\u2019s hard to quantify but kind of qualitatively, how much is a growth in Apex next year is dependent on getting the game approved in China and having success with the title on mobile as well?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, it\u2019s hard to predict when you get approval in China, so we don\u2019t know. So, I would assume that an Apex China console PC game is probably the tail end of the year, if not even the following year. We think, we\u2019ve got a faster pace on mobile globally ex-China. So, we would hope to see that in the year as well, sometime during the year, really depends on how long we keep it in soft launch. But we\u2019re obviously including those as we think about growth but the bulk of that growth is probably \u201822 verses \u201821 where we really start to gain traction there.\nMichael Olson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, this is David on for Alexia. Just within your live services results, is it possible to quantify it all the contribution that you\u2019ve seen from subscription in the quarter? And maybe how should we think about the trajectory of subscriptions going forward, just following the partnership with Valve you announced this morning? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, subscriptions, I mean, live services so large, subscription is still a relatively small portion of that. We are around 5 million subscribers now and have grown much faster on the Sony platform than we did in the early days of the Microsoft platform. Obviously, there are more consoles out there now, so that helps it. But the Sony platform has grown well beyond our expectations, and we\u2019re very excited and they\u2019ve been a great partner for us. As Andrew mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to drive subscriptions across as many platforms as we can. We want to go where the gamers play. And clearly that was the driver of Valve Steam approach. What we found is that subscribers engage more and spend more money at the end of the day. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great business model. They\u2019re very sticky. They tend to stay in the subscriptions longer and they\u2019re looking for great content and they find games they\u2019ve never played before then start to monetize in those games. And that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re so optimistic about it. But it\u2019s still a relatively smaller portion of the overall business because, obviously, in the quarter, almost $500 million of revenue, the big dominators there are Apex and Ultimate Team and followed by The Sims and FIFA Online in Asia, but it continues to be an important part of the overall life services business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.\nEric Handler: Thank you very much and appreciate all of the details you guys have given on the call so far. A couple quick things, hoping you can help out with. One thing that was not mentioned was Titanfall 3 and has that been sort of integrated now into Apex Legends? Is that still being looked at as a separate title?\nBlake Jorgensen: It certainly could be a separate title in the future where we really want to keep the team hyper focused on Apex because we see there\u2019s so much opportunity there. But \u2013 so I can\u2019t give you a sense of if and when it will come, but it\u2019s still a great brand and we certainly won\u2019t forget about it down the road.\nEric Handler: Okay. And then two other quick falls. When you talk about doubling down on live services for next year, you\u2019ve obviously been focusing on live services for a while, but is anything changing with regards to the amount of spending that you guys are doing or anything financially with the model as you double down on these live services?\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, I think there\u2019s really three, four changes. One is, we\u2019re seeing players want to apply and engage more. Again, over the last 24 to 36 months or even a little longer than that, you\u2019ve seen us focused deeply on live service and drive engagement into our games. And you saw that through last year, and we\u2019re seeing that pay off this year. And so, as we look forward, we\u2019re seeing players\u2019 events even greater intention to spend more time into those games. So, this really \u2013 there is two other broad changes. One is just how we developed the cold features inside that game and we\u2019re doubling down on those types of features that allow players to fulfil those cool motivations that drive alive service, social interaction, competition, self-improvement, creation, those things that really drive our live service business. And then we\u2019re doubling down on the teams both in terms of development and marketing in terms of how we bring those things to market. And what you\u2019ve seen this year is a willingness for us to do things slightly differently. If you take what we did with Madden this year, we launched the game earlier and we held another whole set of content for a different audience and marketed that differently, entitled that differently and released at around kickoff, and we\u2019re seeing tremendous success as a result of that. And so not only will we build a double down on the actual development of the feature set, we\u2019re also going to be speaking and communicating and marketing the content differently to gamers across the board.\nBlake Jorgensen: And part of it is changing the talent mix. We\u2019re bringing in more people that have live service expertise. I think there\u2019s probably no one in the world that has better live service expertise than we do in sports. But you need to make sure you\u2019re bringing in talent that can support a team like Apex, support the Battlefield teams so forth. And that\u2019s important because the talent mix is very different and we\u2019ve been successful in recruiting some fabulous people into those teams and will continue to focus on that.\nEric Handler: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Hey, thank you. So Andrew, I\u2019m just wanted to dig in a little bit more in terms of the decision making process that went into Battlefield skipping a year here. So \u2013 and I was wondering whether this is a conscientious decision to shift the direction of the franchise or is this more of a resource constraint decision? And should we still be thinking about those franchise or something that is still a two year or maybe even a three year cycle release or maybe more like a perpetual service like what you may have been intending to do with Anthem. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Good question. So, still that resource constraints, I\u2019ll say that up front, but it was a very thought through decision for us and there was a few factors that came into play. And the first is that we still see a burgeoning opportunity with Battlefield V. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re about to launch a whole new theater of wall with the Pacific theater and the team is still really thinking about, how they can continue to drive that service on a going forward basis. So, we think there\u2019s opportunity still inside the Battlefield V experience, as it was built as a bite large service from the beginning. The second is we now effectively have an annualized shooter Apex Legends and we see tremendous growth opportunity that can continue to engage, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, now over 70 million players. And as Blake talked about, we have opportunity to take that into other regions and to other platforms. And we think is a tremendous growth opportunity on that and want to make sure that we give that the time that it deserves. And then third, as we thought about building for the next Battlefield. Battlefield has always been cutting edge, leading edge, both in terms of visual fidelity, and in gameplay and in multiplayer play. And as a team really began working against that. It became a parent to us that, launching into the next gen platforms was going to offer tremendous opportunity for innovation. But we really wanted to give the install base some opportunity to grow. And believe that in combination with the first three things I talked about launching battlefield in FY \u201822 is a really strong move for us and presents us with an opportunity for strong two years of growth. In terms of the overall franchise direction, I don\u2019t think you should read into this a dramatic change in franchise direction other than it will be driven around live service as the nature of our industry now. It will be cutting edge. It will be high fidelity. It will be doing things in the context of multi-play and social play and competition that Battlefields to this point have not done. And we do believe it will be a really, really exciting title in FY \u201822.\nBlake Jorgensen: Other things, Stephen is a lot of investors, I don\u2019t think fully appreciate the depth of our catalog business. As Andrew mentioned, Battlefield V, we want to continue to have that as a critical part of our catalog. You all might be surprised, but we have sold over 33 million copies of Star Wars Battlefront I and Battlefront II combined. That\u2019s a huge tale for our business going forward. And so we\u2019re very conscious as to how we think about staging when our games come out. And I think people get used to the annual cadence of sports, which works really well in sports, but we want to be careful on some of these other franchises that we give them the long life that they deserve inside our business and can generate great returns for us over a long period of time.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Berg with Berenberg.\nRobert Berg: Hi. Thanks. I\u2019m really looking to dig a bit deeper in VOLTA and some of the early trends you may be seeing there particularly interested in two areas. I guess the first is clearly you\u2019ve seen excellent Ultimate Team KPIs in the period, but how much time a player spending in VOLTA versus your expectations, is it any more or less? And also interested in the appeal with any of some of the vanity items. Have you noticed particularly interested in customizing, any thoughts on setting? And a quick follow-on question if I can, Ultimate Team player growth, but in your opinion with any of this due to VOLTA or just general underlying growth there? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: There was a lot in there I will do my best. First, we\u2019re very happy with VOLTA. Again and what we\u2019ve talked about over the years is our objective around our FIFA franchise more broadly as we think about FIFA is our platform. And how can we build features that attract new audiences to the game? We did that with the journey with story mode for a number of years. We did that with the World Cup content last year and we\u2019re doing that with VOLTA this year with the express purpose of bringing new fans into the game and reigniting the passions of laps fans, who may be not applied FIFA for some time. As a result of that, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, VOLTA is the second most played mode in the game. And games across the board engagement across the board is up in FIFA. So we\u2019re very, very happy about that. In terms of what impact that has on Ultimate Team. What we do continually discover is that Ultimate Team as a mode with these core motivations of collection and competition and social interaction at the very core, often our players ultimately find their spending most of the time. And so, even as we brought players into the game around the journey, even as we brought players into the game around the World Cup content last year, and even as we bring plays into the game around VOLTA this year, we do see a positive impact that has on Ultimate Team over time as players come together with their friends and engage in what is, one of the most fun parts of the FIFA experience. And so our expectation is that we will continue to drive that growth. That Ultimate Team, all the work done in Ultimate Team in of itself drove growth, but the combination of that in bringing new fans through VOLTA effectively drove our Ultimate Team performance. And you should expect it will continue think about our FIFA franchise and our Madden franchise in this way around building new modes to bring people in, and then helping them find their friends in the modes they love the most.\nRobert Berg: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.\nDrew Crum: Hey guys, good afternoon. So, you guys have talked extensively on the audience metrics for Apex. And you know that the weekly players were outperforming close to Season 3 launch versus Season 2. Can you comment on the motivation trends you\u2019re seeing there may be that gives you some conviction around growth in fiscal 2021? And then I guess separately, could you update us on your plans with Google Stadia? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Sure. So, I\u2019ll start on the first one and then Andrew can talk about Google. So, I think the key is you\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re seeing positive monetization trends. We\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s going and that\u2019s why we reiterated where our original guidance was. The key with Apex as any live service is, test and learn, test and learn. So, as Andrew described, we are continuing to add new events in each season to try to understand the spending patterns and what people like to spend money on and how much they\u2019ll spend, and will then tune those events overtime. So, there\u2019s going to be holiday themes events like the Halloween event that\u2019s going on now. There are going to be competitive style events. There are going to be gameplay style events, and then events associated with new characters or as you saw in this season or new map. All of that is along the lines of continuing to try to grow and build the number of players, the weekly average users, the frequency of play and the monetization that falls out of all those combined together. And that is a process that we\u2019ve done over the last 11 years on Ultimate Team. And I think we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at we\u2019re pretty excited about how we\u2019re doing that with Apex. So, more to come, but I think we\u2019re heading in a very positive path there. On the Stadia, update?\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. On Stadia, no updates right now on Stadia. We\u2019ve got some old things coming, both in terms of our own tests, we\u2019re running as part of project Atlas and on the public infrastructure that we\u2019re being very happy about, and with some other cloud partners, who are launching some things in the future.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Hey, guys. Couple of questions, one on FIFA and one on mobile. So, glad to hear that FIFA Ultimate Team bookings is still expected to grow double digits next year. And you mentioned both as a number two mode, but I don\u2019t believe you currently monetize in that mode, as all the cosmetic items can only be earned by playing versus spending money. So, is there a possibility in the future to include a battle path or some friendly monetization mechanism in this mode as well? And on mobile, any overall thoughts on partnering with overseas companies like Tencent to help develop your mobile titles? And would that be included in your bucket of two titles from third parties next year? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: So, on VOLTA, yes, we\u2019re seeing strong engagement in the visual content and the aesthetic content. We don\u2019t have a focus on the monetization of that content this year. As we have done over the years, the first objective is to attract new players. I think we\u2019ve done that very well so far. The second objective is to drive deep engagement of that player base overtime. And then typically, once you put those two things together, it ultimately drives monetization, but that\u2019s not our focus this year.\nBlake Jorgensen: And just a couple of clarifications on your second question. So, we said double digits growth in the quarter for FIFA not for next year. I don't know what we're doing for next year. We're very excited that we can continue to grow. That's what we said. But we didn't give any sort of sizing on any of the products for next year. I will say that the double digit growth is healthy double digit growth. So I'm not talking about 11% here. We're 10%, we're talking about healthy double digit growth across both FIFA and Madden. And we're very excited about the continuation of that. And we're just reporting on that in the in the quarter. And in terms of the other two titles, those are third party console PC titles we were speaking of, not mobile titles. But you should assume that obviously for Apex mobile in China, we would use a third party. And I think as we've said, we're considering using a third party for Apex mobile globally, because obviously there could be some ability to have some economies of scale there by using one partner maybe.\nMario Lu: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America.\nRyan Gee: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I may. So if you look at revenue from packaged goods and full game download, it looks like that was down a little bit year-over-year, but you guys did report FIFA and Madden were up nicely in the double digits. So can you just explain the disconnect between sales in new games revenue being down and some of your new releases being up year-over-year? Was there any pressure on ASPs or was the catalog weaker? That's the first question. And I have a follow-up.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, so yeah, so full game download is actually up year-over-year 11%. So 275 million from 157 a year ago. The strength in that was driven by Madden and FIFA. Remember there's only a few days in FIFA. And remember as well FIFA, we did not ship gen 3 FIFA this year, it's the first year we've stopped selling gen 3 FIFA. So you can imagine there was some downward pressure on gen three. We also added PS4 into the subscription. And so you can imagine there was also some people playing FIFA through the subscription. And so we still see growth with those factors is pretty impressive. We are seeing you know, obviously, some of the older titles probably are dropping off even though they tend to sell well as full game downloads, but they're always an age, you know, on those so something like, you know, a FIFA 18 that someone might still buy as a full game download because they wanted the World Cup mode. You're seeing less of that. But overall, we saw growth across all the core franchises led by FIFA and madden.\nRyan Gee: Okay, that's helpful. So it sounds like it maybe is more helpful for us to look at subscriptions plus packaged goods revenue plus full game downloads revenue, because people are shifting in and out of each bucket year-over-year. So maybe that's a better way to look at your business going forward?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, I think the other thing to remember is, we're now over 50% of full games being sold digitally. You have to imagine that if you're a retailer out there, you are buying less full games. And historically, the business was built on, you sold in a huge amounts of games, and then those sold out over a long period of time and you oftentimes had to support that with marketing or sales reserves. That business has changed dramatically. Retailers are either buying less or maybe not even in business. And that's because people are buying things digitally. But that flattens the sales curve in some way for some of these games. And I think you'll see that across the entire industry, not just with us.\nRyan Gee: Okay, great. And then just my second question is related to DICE and Battlefield. So they're not going to have a title next year, is it fair to assume that they will still have something for next year as you think about the Star Wars Battlefront franchise if that could be some project for next year? And why would any project that you do have next year, would you not want that to benefit from the new console launches, as you mentioned that, you know, Battlefield 6 or what you might call it will benefit from a larger install base? And why wouldn't you just hold titles out everything till fiscal '22?\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things going on there. One is we're not announcing anything else that DICE is doing in specifics for next year. But you should imagine with a number of live services and play that will continue to support those. And Blake talked about the ongoing strength of Battlefront II, and I reference the ongoing strength of Battlefield 5. As we think about balancing the portfolio around titles launch next year, and titles that will get the greatest boost of later on, what we have seen is a greater propensity for sports game players to play across both generations of title and we've seen that lift. And some of the things that we really want to do in the Battlefield franchise as it relates to the new fidelity that will really show up well inside of a Battlefield game. We'd like to have a deep install base for. So it really comes down to balancing a whole range of different things across our portfolio. But we feel very good about the opportunity to grow the business next year, and have a Battlefield tall in FY '22 that will grow there well and deliver on what our fan expectations will be for Battlefield game on next gen platforms.\nRyan Gee: Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng: Hi. Thank you very much for the question and for the color for fiscal '21 and '22. I just had two if I could. And the first is just on Madden. Could you just comment a little bit about how Madden compares to FIFA from engagement and content and monetization perspective? And whether you see the opportunity to close the gap there in the next few years? And second, with rises Skywalker being the last Star Wars movie until 2022, can you talk about how the timing of theatrical content affects your Star Wars strategy going forward, if at all? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: So the Madden metrics are actually very similar to the FIFA metrics with one exception that the Madden metrics monetize better than FIFA because it's primarily a U.S. based sport and FIFA is very global. And so you obviously have economic differences. So the ARPU effectively is higher in the U.S. But the number of people who play Ultimate Team are very similar. The number of people who spend in Ultimate Team are very similar. And the timing of how people play relative to the sports season is similar. The other thing that FIFA has demand \u2013 FIFA is a longer season, right, you get a full nine plus months where you're not getting that long of a season in Madden. But we've done a good job of extending the events, post the Super Bowl to try to keep people engaged around the combine and draft and all those things that transpire. And we're stretching that engagement out. And so \u2013 but you know, even with hockey, we see similar patterns across the Ultimate Team. It's really at the end of the day, the revenue is driven by one the size of the game. Obviously, FIFA larger because it's a global game and two by the local economics around how much people are willing to spend relative to their overall spend patterns. The second question?\nAndrew Wilson: On the Star Wars piece, so well the rise of Skywalker is the last in this particular film set. You know, Disney had talked about having extraordinarily robust plans around that franchise over time. What we talked about was, you know, The Mandalorian coming with Disney plus the new movie And Galaxy's Edge in theme parks. And so our expectation is that in partnership with Disney, we will get the benefit of the ongoing plans around the continued development and provision of great content experiences for Star Wars fans for many years to come.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we have time for one final question. Your question comes from the line as Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.\nMike Hickey: Hi Andrew. Great quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think last question like you gave a little bit more granularity on active players, it's 8 to 10 million weekly after season. You could update, that sounds like high, just want to confirm that? And then on your 300 million to 400 million for the year, that you reiterated. Can you give us some perspective where you are trending within that range as we sort of set the stage for growth for fiscal '21? Then I have a quick follow-up.\nBlake Jorgensen: I can't give you any more than the range. But I just remind people that 300 million to 400 million is a small portion of 5.125 billion, so don't over index on it. Because if it was three and a quarter versus 3.75 versus 400, I don't think that's going to make a break the year. In terms of the user profile, I think Andrew mentioned that was very similar weekly average users still in that 8 to 10 million range. We're very happy with that. That's extremely robust. And you know one of the largest games that we've ever seen inside our portfolio and that continues on. It's very engaged and community. And, you know, you'll continue to see us add things that drive engagement like esports and obviously more content. And we feel like it's tracking as we would have thought.\nMike Hickey: Good. I guess the second question from me is, as you sort of gave us a perspective of '21, '22 fiscal, did see anything BioWare, or from BioWare, or Star Wars, Star Wars related IP games and development for console PC over the next couple of years, or if you think that or we should just assume that likely is going to expire? And then on BioWare I think Dragon Age is going to go up, any thoughts on that studio post Anthem looking at future releases? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, I mean, you should assume that there's, you know, Dragon Age out there, and we talked about it publicly that it's in the works and probably comes after fiscal '22. But, you know, we typically don't give multiyear guidance this early in the year or multiyear guidance period. So I don't want to start giving '23 guidance now that I've started a hint on '22. But you should assume it's out there and plans are underway for that product, as well as some other products. There's some other Disney stuff that might drop into \u2013 Star Wars stuff that might drop into '22 or maybe even earlier, but with more to come on that. We're still highly engaged around the Disney license. Believe it or not, we are close to a $1 million on Star Wars: The Old Republic, revenue from the start of its history. So you know, it's a business that just keeps on going. And we like those types of businesses and we're going to continue to layer those in and clearly Star Wars is part of that process.\nMike Hickey: Thanks a lot.\nBlake Jorgensen: All right. Thank you everyone. We'll talk to everybody, either between now and the end of next quarter or the end of next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. The strong results this quarter illustrate the power of our focus on live services and on our core franchises. Games are evolving, and the way people play them is changing. We had great launches for FIFA and Madden, and the quarter's story is dominated by live services that engage players over extended periods of time. Live services strength in Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Apex Legends and FIFA Online drove performance significantly above last year. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.348 billion, above our guidance by $33 million. Operating expenses were $675 million, $4 million lower than our guidance. GAAP operating income was $268 million, compared to an operating income of $258 million a year ago, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.89, $0.29 better than our guidance. As a reminder, $2.11 of our earnings was driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. Underlying profit was much stronger than we had expected, driven by increased sales, lower operating expenses and a richer digital mix. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $37 million, up $163 million from last year. The increase was driven primarily by higher profit and faster collections. Operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months was $1.748 billion, $290 million above last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $27 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $10 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.3 million shares at a cost of $306 million, leaving $674 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.9 billion. Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.277 billion, up $55 million on the prior year, and $47 million above our guidance. Performance over guidance was driven by broad strength across our portfolio with notable growth in live services. Digital net bookings were $790 million, up 24% on the year-ago period, and a new record for the second quarter, driven by growth across our numerous live services offerings as well as an increase in full-game digital downloads. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing twelve-month basis, compared to 69% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn, Live services net bookings were up 50% year-on-year, to $493 million, another new Q2 record. The increase was driven by Apex Legends, Ultimate Team, in Madden, FIFA and NHL, The Sims 4, and FIFA Online, partially offset by the tail of Battlefield 1 DLC. EA Access is off to a great start on PlayStation. Ultimate Team net bookings grew strongly year-on-year for both Madden and FIFA. Even adjusting for the fact that Madden had an extra week in the quarter, and both Madden and FIFA benefitted from early access sales on PlayStation through EA Access, both were up double-digit percentages over last year. Notably, given that we launched VOLTA Football in FIFA 20 and it immediately became the number 2 mode in the game, behind only Ultimate Team, weekly average users for FIFA Ultimate Team still grew 15% year-on-year. Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 20% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. The segment outperformed our expectations, driven by new content in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. FIFA Mobile China, FIFA Online 4 Mobile, Madden Mobile and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes all grew this quarter, and, subsequent to quarter end, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes had its second-biggest day ever. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $175 million, 11% higher than last year, another Q2 record. The digital portion of Madden sales increased 9 percentage points year-on-year, to 51%. FIFA launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first 3 weeks of sales, it was about 34% digital, up from 29% in the comparable period for FIFA 19. Overall, 50% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the 12 months to September 30. This compares to just 42% a year ago. Turning to guidance. Our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is $5.410 billion, and earnings per share of $9.57. As a reminder, $5.74 of this is driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.625 billion, $50 million above our prior expectations. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.50 billion. With regards to business drivers, we have raised our net bookings outlook for the year to $5.125 billion. Live services remain strong, and we continue to expect Apex Legends and The Sims to both deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We're not passing through the full beat, primarily as the FX headwind has increased significantly and we have pushed NBA Live 20 and Respawn's VR Medal of Honor title out of the year. Together, these headwinds amount to approximately $100 million against our original expectations for net bookings. For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.51 billion, cost of revenue to be $482 million, and operating expenses of $733 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, driven by the negative adjustment to variable compensation a year ago. This results in earnings per share of $0.92 for the third quarter using the diluted share count of 295 million. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.94 billion. This is up 21% year-on-year, driven by live services, particularly Apex Legends and Ultimate Team, and because we have two launches in the quarter this year, versus one last year. We released the launch trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order this morning, and early reaction appears extremely positive. We're excited to bring this action title to Star Wars fans on November 15, and continue to model sales in the range of 6 to 8 million units. We are modelling Need For Speed Heat to perform similarly to previous titles in that franchise, with unit sales of 3 to 4 million units. Looking further ahead, I'd like to expand on the view Andrew gave you into our fiscal 2021 slate. We're doubling down on live services combined with our core franchises. We're investing in Apex Legends as our shooter in fiscal 2021. We expect to drive growth in all of our major live services next year, including Ultimate Team, Apex Legends, FIFA Online and The Sims. We will continue to grow our subscription business. We believe Apex growth will be driven in part by the continued expansion of content and by the launch of the service on new platforms, geographies and on mobile. As Andrew noted, the Sims is now a $5 billion franchise for us, and it continues to grow, driven by new content and new platforms. Mobile growth will be driven by the ramp of our new Plants vs. Zombies title, sports on mobile, including FIFA Mobile in Asia, and Apex Legends, offset by aging titles elsewhere in our portfolio. With regards to product launches in fiscal 2021, we will add at least one more sports title to our annual slate. We will launch Medal of Honor VR. We'll deliver some exciting remasters of fan favorites, including the Command & Conquer game we've already disclosed. And we have two new unannounced EA Partners titles coming from third-party developers. In addition, we have other unannounced titles in the FY21 slate, we will give specifics nearer the time. Overall, we expect to drive growth in net bookings and underlying profits for fiscal 2021. We will provide formal guidance on our Q4 call as usual. Growth in fiscal 2022 will be led by a new and very exciting Battlefield title. I introduced the quarter by discussing how player preferences have changed the way we build and deliver games. We're investing in games that people play for longer and engage with much more deeply. For example, the number of matches played in FIFA per player has grown nearly 10% year-on-year, and we expect VOLTA to grow that still further. Similarly, the time spent playing matches in Madden NFL 20 is up by about one third. We expect this strategy and focus will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company through the remainder of this year and beyond. With that I'll turn the call back to Andrew. So let me take live server one first, Eric. You know, we have invested heavily in live services over the past 10 years. Obviously, we're seeing the benefits of that today with titles like Ultimate Team across all our sports and The Sims, obviously Apex is a new live service which we will invest heavily in to try to continue to grow that business. We view that as an annual shooter franchise effectively. And we're trying to build that as a 10 year business not one year or two year business. And we're very excited about the roadmap that the response team has put in place. Beyond that, obviously FIFA Online in Asia is critical. We're announcing as we move from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4 in Korea rapid growth. We're still operating both platforms online 3, and online 4 in China and over time, we'll move to a single platform there. But we feel like we're out of the woods on the bad comp from last year and so we're starting to see good growth there. And we're looking at how do we extend live services across every single one of our titles that can be as successful or more successful than what we see on our sports titles and The Sims and Apex. That includes titles like Battlefield titles, the action game like Anthem and you'll continue to see improvements across that and we're excited about where that can go. It is how people want to play games. It is where we think we have a skillset that is different than many of the other game companies and we think we can continue to be very successful there. Yeah, no, we were implying growth for Sims as well. We've continued to grow that title every year for that since it was shipped what seven years ago and we feel that continues on. They've got a really robust plan for continued growth. And there may be some other re-masters that we do along the Command & Conquer line that we just haven't announced yet. But that \u2013 we believe all that yield is pretty exciting fiscal 2021. And effectively, what we're doing is giving you some guidance on fiscal 2022, knowing that the Battlefield is coming then. And remember, the goal of Battlefield for 2022 is to really take advantage of a larger installed base of the new console. Bringing out Battlefield next year, where the new console base is fairly small, doesn't really give justice to the potential of the title. And so that's part of our driver and moving the title into fiscal 2022. So, think about it as multiyear growth model that we just tried to lay out for people, and we're pretty excited about it. Yeah, it's hard to predict when you get approval in China, so we don't know. So, I would assume that an Apex China console PC game is probably the tail end of the year, if not even the following year. We think, we've got a faster pace on mobile globally ex-China. So, we would hope to see that in the year as well, sometime during the year, really depends on how long we keep it in soft launch. But we're obviously including those as we think about growth but the bulk of that growth is probably \u201822 verses \u201821 where we really start to gain traction there. Yeah, I mean, subscriptions, I mean, live services so large, subscription is still a relatively small portion of that. We are around 5 million subscribers now and have grown much faster on the Sony platform than we did in the early days of the Microsoft platform. Obviously, there are more consoles out there now, so that helps it. But the Sony platform has grown well beyond our expectations, and we're very excited and they've been a great partner for us. As Andrew mentioned, we're continuing to drive subscriptions across as many platforms as we can. We want to go where the gamers play. And clearly that was the driver of Valve Steam approach. What we found is that subscribers engage more and spend more money at the end of the day. That's why it's such a great business model. They're very sticky. They tend to stay in the subscriptions longer and they're looking for great content and they find games they've never played before then start to monetize in those games. And that's the reason we're so optimistic about it. But it's still a relatively smaller portion of the overall business because, obviously, in the quarter, almost $500 million of revenue, the big dominators there are Apex and Ultimate Team and followed by The Sims and FIFA Online in Asia, but it continues to be an important part of the overall life services business. It certainly could be a separate title in the future where we really want to keep the team hyper focused on Apex because we see there's so much opportunity there. But \u2013 so I can't give you a sense of if and when it will come, but it's still a great brand and we certainly won't forget about it down the road. And part of it is changing the talent mix. We're bringing in more people that have live service expertise. I think there's probably no one in the world that has better live service expertise than we do in sports. But you need to make sure you're bringing in talent that can support a team like Apex, support the Battlefield teams so forth. And that's important because the talent mix is very different and we've been successful in recruiting some fabulous people into those teams and will continue to focus on that. Other things, Stephen is a lot of investors, I don't think fully appreciate the depth of our catalog business. As Andrew mentioned, Battlefield V, we want to continue to have that as a critical part of our catalog. You all might be surprised, but we have sold over 33 million copies of Star Wars Battlefront I and Battlefront II combined. That's a huge tale for our business going forward. And so we're very conscious as to how we think about staging when our games come out. And I think people get used to the annual cadence of sports, which works really well in sports, but we want to be careful on some of these other franchises that we give them the long life that they deserve inside our business and can generate great returns for us over a long period of time. Sure. So, I'll start on the first one and then Andrew can talk about Google. So, I think the key is you're thinking, we're seeing positive monetization trends. We're excited about where it's going and that's why we reiterated where our original guidance was. The key with Apex as any live service is, test and learn, test and learn. So, as Andrew described, we are continuing to add new events in each season to try to understand the spending patterns and what people like to spend money on and how much they'll spend, and will then tune those events overtime. So, there's going to be holiday themes events like the Halloween event that's going on now. There are going to be competitive style events. There are going to be gameplay style events, and then events associated with new characters or as you saw in this season or new map. All of that is along the lines of continuing to try to grow and build the number of players, the weekly average users, the frequency of play and the monetization that falls out of all those combined together. And that is a process that we've done over the last 11 years on Ultimate Team. And I think we've gotten pretty good at we're pretty excited about how we're doing that with Apex. So, more to come, but I think we're heading in a very positive path there. On the Stadia, update? And just a couple of clarifications on your second question. So, we said double digits growth in the quarter for FIFA not for next year. I don't know what we're doing for next year. We're very excited that we can continue to grow. That's what we said. But we didn't give any sort of sizing on any of the products for next year. I will say that the double digit growth is healthy double digit growth. So I'm not talking about 11% here. We're 10%, we're talking about healthy double digit growth across both FIFA and Madden. And we're very excited about the continuation of that. And we're just reporting on that in the in the quarter. And in terms of the other two titles, those are third party console PC titles we were speaking of, not mobile titles. But you should assume that obviously for Apex mobile in China, we would use a third party. And I think as we've said, we're considering using a third party for Apex mobile globally, because obviously there could be some ability to have some economies of scale there by using one partner maybe. Yeah, so yeah, so full game download is actually up year-over-year 11%. So 275 million from 157 a year ago. The strength in that was driven by Madden and FIFA. Remember there's only a few days in FIFA. And remember as well FIFA, we did not ship gen 3 FIFA this year, it's the first year we've stopped selling gen 3 FIFA. So you can imagine there was some downward pressure on gen three. We also added PS4 into the subscription. And so you can imagine there was also some people playing FIFA through the subscription. And so we still see growth with those factors is pretty impressive. We are seeing you know, obviously, some of the older titles probably are dropping off even though they tend to sell well as full game downloads, but they're always an age, you know, on those so something like, you know, a FIFA 18 that someone might still buy as a full game download because they wanted the World Cup mode. You're seeing less of that. But overall, we saw growth across all the core franchises led by FIFA and madden. Yeah, I think the other thing to remember is, we're now over 50% of full games being sold digitally. You have to imagine that if you're a retailer out there, you are buying less full games. And historically, the business was built on, you sold in a huge amounts of games, and then those sold out over a long period of time and you oftentimes had to support that with marketing or sales reserves. That business has changed dramatically. Retailers are either buying less or maybe not even in business. And that's because people are buying things digitally. But that flattens the sales curve in some way for some of these games. And I think you'll see that across the entire industry, not just with us. So the Madden metrics are actually very similar to the FIFA metrics with one exception that the Madden metrics monetize better than FIFA because it's primarily a U.S. based sport and FIFA is very global. And so you obviously have economic differences. So the ARPU effectively is higher in the U.S. But the number of people who play Ultimate Team are very similar. The number of people who spend in Ultimate Team are very similar. And the timing of how people play relative to the sports season is similar. The other thing that FIFA has demand \u2013 FIFA is a longer season, right, you get a full nine plus months where you're not getting that long of a season in Madden. But we've done a good job of extending the events, post the Super Bowl to try to keep people engaged around the combine and draft and all those things that transpire. And we're stretching that engagement out. And so \u2013 but you know, even with hockey, we see similar patterns across the Ultimate Team. It's really at the end of the day, the revenue is driven by one the size of the game. Obviously, FIFA larger because it's a global game and two by the local economics around how much people are willing to spend relative to their overall spend patterns. The second question? I can't give you any more than the range. But I just remind people that 300 million to 400 million is a small portion of 5.125 billion, so don't over index on it. Because if it was three and a quarter versus 3.75 versus 400, I don't think that's going to make a break the year. In terms of the user profile, I think Andrew mentioned that was very similar weekly average users still in that 8 to 10 million range. We're very happy with that. That's extremely robust. And you know one of the largest games that we've ever seen inside our portfolio and that continues on. It's very engaged and community. And, you know, you'll continue to see us add things that drive engagement like esports and obviously more content. And we feel like it's tracking as we would have thought. Yeah, I mean, you should assume that there's, you know, Dragon Age out there, and we talked about it publicly that it's in the works and probably comes after fiscal '22. But, you know, we typically don't give multiyear guidance this early in the year or multiyear guidance period. So I don't want to start giving '23 guidance now that I've started a hint on '22. But you should assume it's out there and plans are underway for that product, as well as some other products. There's some other Disney stuff that might drop into \u2013 Star Wars stuff that might drop into '22 or maybe even earlier, but with more to come on that. We're still highly engaged around the Disney license. Believe it or not, we are close to a $1 million on Star Wars: The Old Republic, revenue from the start of its history. So you know, it's a business that just keeps on going. And we like those types of businesses and we're going to continue to layer those in and clearly Star Wars is part of that process. All right. Thank you everyone. We'll talk to everybody, either between now and the end of next quarter or the end of next quarter."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. We continued a strong FY '20 with an excellent second quarter. Our latest EA SPORTS titles are captivating a growing global player base, and deep engagement in these titles and our ongoing live services fueled our continued momentum through Q2. As a result, our revenue and earnings per share exceeded our expectations for Q2, and we are raising our full year guidance today. At Electronic Arts, we are focused on creating amazing new games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and reaching more players when and where they want to play. I'll share a few highlights here of how we delivered against these focus areas during Q2. First, let's cover our new games. EA SPORTS is innovating for a growing audience of fans. Madden NFL 20 is off to an outstanding start, growing year-over-year in player engagement, units sold and Ultimate Team. The excellent core gameplay and fresh new experiences in franchise mode are delivering for our loyal fans, while Superstar X-Factors and the all-new Superstar KO mode are resonating with a broader football community. With a launch that began earlier in the preseason and a second major beat at the NFL Kickoff weekend that brought more players into the game, we've delivered growth across the board in Madden. Unique players were up 12% year-over-year in Q2, games played in franchise mode more than doubled to over 100 million in the same period, and Madden Ultimate Team unique players are up nearly 20% year over-year. Our Madden competitive gaming season has kicked off as well. Our major tournaments are aligned to key moments in the NFL season, we have a groundbreaking virtual stadium rights partner, and other major brands are partnering with us throughout the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. The innovation in FIFA 20 is also deeply engaging fans and bringing new players into the franchise. Total players in FIFA were up nearly 15% year-over-year in Q2, and with the addition of the VOLTA Football street soccer experience, new-to-franchise players have grown 7% year over-year. Enhancements to the core gameplay and Ultimate Team are also re-engaging more franchise veterans, with unique players in FIFA Ultimate Team growing 22% over last year. People are playing more FIFA than ever before, with total in-game matches up more than 30% year-over-year. And as players continue to engage in the FIFA 20 experience and Ultimate Team, our FIFA 20 Global Series is kicking off in November, with millions set to compete in our unparalleled nine-month worldwide esports competition. Last season, more than 800 million minutes of FIFA esports content were watched, and with sponsors like Adidas and others breaking new ground with us this year, we're excited to reach an expanding audience with more great content. We also saw growth across our broader EA SPORTS portfolio. With innovations in NHL 20 delivering for hockey fans, Hockey Ultimate Team grew year-over-year in Q2. FIFA Online in Korea had some of our strongest-ever months on PC, and we're also seeing growth in China. FIFA Mobile has now been downloaded more than 250 million times life to date, following the launch of our latest season that includes 650 new in-game events. It was a very strong Q2 for EA SPORTS, and we're excited to build on that momentum throughout FY20. Q2 also showed the strength of our ongoing live services. In Apex Legends, we continue to deepen our long-term investment in the game and its community. With each successive season of new content, we are building, adding to the experience, and learning. For the first season in March, we launched the Battle Pass, and began the regular introduction of new legends. In the second season in July, we brought more content, a map update, ranked leagues and larger events. The third season, which launched in October, is our biggest yet with an entirely new map, amazing events like the Halloween-themed content in the game now, and much more to come. Weekly average player peaks in Season Three are significantly above our Season Two peaks, and we're continuing to bring more new players into the game. Apex Legends is a major long term franchise for us. Since launch, we've significantly expanded the team working on the game, and it continues to grow. Our pipeline of future content is packed with really fun experiences that will be delivered through upcoming seasons and a regular cadence of updates for the community. With the Apex Legends community now growing past 70 million players, we're focused on expanding to mobile, new platforms and new geographies, as well as launching an Apex competitive gaming program that we'll share details on soon. The Sims 4 also continues to be an incredible long-term live service with a growing audience. Monthly average players are up more than 40% year-over-year in The Sims 4, and engagement across the franchise has led The Sims to surpass $5 billion in lifetime sales. The Sims continues to be one of the great franchises in gaming, and we have plans to bring new experiences to its amazing players for a long time to come. We are also reaching new milestones as we seek to bring great games and services to more players on more platforms. The launch of EA Access on PlayStation 4 significantly grew our subscriber base through the course of Q2. We also announced this morning our plans to bring EA Access to Steam on PC, adding a fourth platform where players will be able to connect and get the benefits and value of our subscription service. This is a unique and exciting partnership with Valve that will enable us to bring PC players in the Steam and Origin communities together. Helping more players connect to our games whenever and wherever they want to play will be a continuing focus for us. We look forward to sharing more announcements about other platforms in the coming months. For our holiday quarter of FY '20, we're delivering great new games and content across our portfolio. First, the irreverent new Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville launched two weeks ago to praise from fans and critics, and we're looking forward to the holidays for this family-friendly game. In early November, Need for Speed Heat arrives for racing fans, blending street racing by day and underground racing by night, all with the deep customization that fans expect. Players have been getting primed through the Need for Speed Heat Studio mobile app launched this summer, where they have already customized more than 7 million cars, which can be loaded straight into the game at launch. Then, on November 15, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order arrives worldwide. This game is coming to market at such an amazing time. From the launch of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disney theme parks; to the upcoming Disney+ series The Mandalorian; to ongoing games like Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront II, and The Old Republic; to the culmination of the Skywalker saga in the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, this is a year unlike any other for hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans out there. The one fantasy that many of those fans have been telling us they want is to experience the journey of becoming a Jedi and we're set to deliver that with Jedi: Fallen Order. The Respawn team have been pouring their passion into creating this new game in partnership with Lucasfilm, with characters old and new, and a story that is now an authentic part of the Star Wars universe. It's going to be a thrilling adventure to play, and with more than 140 million views to date of trailers and videos for the game, the community is eager to jump into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in just a few more weeks. The holidays will also be a busy season for players in our live services. Our Battlefield V players will be able to jump into the expansive new Pacific theater, a major addition to the game that includes new factions, maps, weapons and vehicles, starting two days from now. And in Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS franchises, The Sims 4, Anthem and Star Wars Battlefront II, our communities will all have new content and new experiences to dive into during the holiday quarter. Looking farther ahead, I want to share a few thoughts on FY \u201821 and our plans for the continued growth of Electronic Arts. We reach a massive global audience of players with our games today, and we have a core business fueled by live services that continues to grow. Next year, we will build on that with a full slate of new EA SPORTS experiences, including new titles that we are adding to our sports portfolio. New consoles are always an opportunity to drive more innovation in our EA SPORTS games, as our fans are eager to begin experiencing a new generation of play. That will include our plans for NBA LIVE. With great support from the NBA and NBA Players Association, we had been working on an innovative new direction for our game timed with the All-Star weekend, an experience designed around new ways for players to engage, connect and create through basketball. Now, with greater understanding of the new platforms and what they can power, bringing social connection, accessibility, and player creativity to the forefront, we feel we can go so much further with the new design. So we've decided not to ship an NBA LIVE game in FY '20. Instead, we're expanding our vision for NBA LIVE, and continuing to work closely with our NBA and NB Players Association partners on this new project that we'll share more details on next year. Our live services will continue to grow and enhance the experience in our major franchises. We're expanding our Apex Legends team to deliver our content plans for FY '21, and we will reach new audiences through mobile and across Asia. We have ongoing growth expectations for The Sims 4, with new expansions and all-new ways to engage and grow the community. Our Battlefield franchise and its community are also a major focus for us, and we'll add new content and new ways to play Battlefield V in FY '21. Targeting new innovation that will be enabled by next-gen platforms and a growing install base on the new consoles, our next Battlefield game is set for FY '22. We also have plans for new experiences that we've not yet announced for next year, new titles and new IP for multiple platforms. Introducing new games will always be at our core, and we look forward to exciting players with unexpected new titles in FY21. We will also be driving new opportunities to connect with more players through expansion our subscription services, new platforms, cloud gaming, and more. We're confident in the continued growth of our business at Electronic Arts through FY '20, FY '21 and beyond. We have a big holiday quarter ahead of us, and we're excited to continue a strong year. Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake. Thanks Blake. It is a great time to be part of the interactive entertainment industry. The excitement throughout the community for new experiences and innovation shows how games more than any other form of entertainment can bring people together. Billions of people, from every corner of the world, bring their passion to play, connect, compete, and share through games. Making that possible is what drives every single one of us at Electronic Arts. Amazing games are the very core of our business growth. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio of games across genres, fulfilling a breadth of motivations for our players. From escape in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, to competition though EA SPORTS, to social connection in Battlefield V, and more. Creativity fuels our future, and our studios have many more new experiences in development. New IP at Motive, new projects at DICE, Bioware, Maxis and Criterion, new mobile titles, new titles for EA SPORTS, new indie and third-party developer titles, all that will continue to excite and grow our global audience. Live services extend and enhance the experience of those games. Apex Legends, FIFA, The Sims 4, Galaxy of Heroes and more of our top franchises have thriving global communities spanning hundreds of millions of players. We've been pioneers in this space, building on years of expertise and success to deliver continuously evolving experiences fueled by new content, in game events, and fan-requested updates. Competitive gaming adds another dimension to the experience to play and watch, and we're building on our strength here with more of our franchises set to enter esports in the coming months. As players around the world play their favorite games for longer periods of time, robust live services will continue to be vital to the experience, and a growth driver for our business. Reaching more players on more platforms is also a key driver for us. New consoles, cloud gaming, and more platform choices will continue to expand the addressable audience. We're thrilled to be bringing the EA and Steam communities together through the EA Access subscription, and we're working to reach more platforms in the near future. As cloud gaming continues to develop, through Project Atlas we are testing games streamed on public cloud infrastructure to ensure we are at the forefront of this developing space. We're also very excited to continue working with our first-party partners on their new platforms, where we'll be well positioned to deliver some outstanding new experiences beginning next year. With some of the most talented, creative and passionate teams in the industry, we are building momentum. Our focus on making great games and live services for more players around the world has never been stronger. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. On the EA's SPORTS point, there are a number of EA SPORTS games that we've worked on or developed or published over the years. Some of those sports, we're seeing strong resurgence and strong growth, and we're investing back in. It's an area of key strength for us as a business, and EA SPORTS teams have demonstrated an ability to truly engage a global population of sports fans. With respect to NCAA Sports in general, yes, we have been in that business before as well. We saw the news today as did you, we had fed into the NCAA Working Group. That news today was new to us. We're still digesting it. We would anticipate that there is still a number of things that would have to happen over the coming years before we will be able to get back into that business, but certainly we're watching closely. Yeah, I think there's really three, four changes. One is, we're seeing players want to apply and engage more. Again, over the last 24 to 36 months or even a little longer than that, you've seen us focused deeply on live service and drive engagement into our games. And you saw that through last year, and we're seeing that pay off this year. And so, as we look forward, we're seeing players' events even greater intention to spend more time into those games. So, this really \u2013 there is two other broad changes. One is just how we developed the cold features inside that game and we're doubling down on those types of features that allow players to fulfil those cool motivations that drive alive service, social interaction, competition, self-improvement, creation, those things that really drive our live service business. And then we're doubling down on the teams both in terms of development and marketing in terms of how we bring those things to market. And what you've seen this year is a willingness for us to do things slightly differently. If you take what we did with Madden this year, we launched the game earlier and we held another whole set of content for a different audience and marketed that differently, entitled that differently and released at around kickoff, and we're seeing tremendous success as a result of that. And so not only will we build a double down on the actual development of the feature set, we're also going to be speaking and communicating and marketing the content differently to gamers across the board. Good question. So, still that resource constraints, I'll say that up front, but it was a very thought through decision for us and there was a few factors that came into play. And the first is that we still see a burgeoning opportunity with Battlefield V. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we're about to launch a whole new theater of wall with the Pacific theater and the team is still really thinking about, how they can continue to drive that service on a going forward basis. So, we think there's opportunity still inside the Battlefield V experience, as it was built as a bite large service from the beginning. The second is we now effectively have an annualized shooter Apex Legends and we see tremendous growth opportunity that can continue to engage, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, now over 70 million players. And as Blake talked about, we have opportunity to take that into other regions and to other platforms. And we think is a tremendous growth opportunity on that and want to make sure that we give that the time that it deserves. And then third, as we thought about building for the next Battlefield. Battlefield has always been cutting edge, leading edge, both in terms of visual fidelity, and in gameplay and in multiplayer play. And as a team really began working against that. It became a parent to us that, launching into the next gen platforms was going to offer tremendous opportunity for innovation. But we really wanted to give the install base some opportunity to grow. And believe that in combination with the first three things I talked about launching battlefield in FY \u201822 is a really strong move for us and presents us with an opportunity for strong two years of growth. In terms of the overall franchise direction, I don't think you should read into this a dramatic change in franchise direction other than it will be driven around live service as the nature of our industry now. It will be cutting edge. It will be high fidelity. It will be doing things in the context of multi-play and social play and competition that Battlefields to this point have not done. And we do believe it will be a really, really exciting title in FY \u201822. There was a lot in there I will do my best. First, we're very happy with VOLTA. Again and what we've talked about over the years is our objective around our FIFA franchise more broadly as we think about FIFA is our platform. And how can we build features that attract new audiences to the game? We did that with the journey with story mode for a number of years. We did that with the World Cup content last year and we're doing that with VOLTA this year with the express purpose of bringing new fans into the game and reigniting the passions of laps fans, who may be not applied FIFA for some time. As a result of that, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, VOLTA is the second most played mode in the game. And games across the board engagement across the board is up in FIFA. So we're very, very happy about that. In terms of what impact that has on Ultimate Team. What we do continually discover is that Ultimate Team as a mode with these core motivations of collection and competition and social interaction at the very core, often our players ultimately find their spending most of the time. And so, even as we brought players into the game around the journey, even as we brought players into the game around the World Cup content last year, and even as we bring plays into the game around VOLTA this year, we do see a positive impact that has on Ultimate Team over time as players come together with their friends and engage in what is, one of the most fun parts of the FIFA experience. And so our expectation is that we will continue to drive that growth. That Ultimate Team, all the work done in Ultimate Team in of itself drove growth, but the combination of that in bringing new fans through VOLTA effectively drove our Ultimate Team performance. And you should expect it will continue think about our FIFA franchise and our Madden franchise in this way around building new modes to bring people in, and then helping them find their friends in the modes they love the most. Yeah. On Stadia, no updates right now on Stadia. We've got some old things coming, both in terms of our own tests, we're running as part of project Atlas and on the public infrastructure that we're being very happy about, and with some other cloud partners, who are launching some things in the future. So, on VOLTA, yes, we're seeing strong engagement in the visual content and the aesthetic content. We don't have a focus on the monetization of that content this year. As we have done over the years, the first objective is to attract new players. I think we've done that very well so far. The second objective is to drive deep engagement of that player base overtime. And then typically, once you put those two things together, it ultimately drives monetization, but that's not our focus this year. Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things going on there. One is we're not announcing anything else that DICE is doing in specifics for next year. But you should imagine with a number of live services and play that will continue to support those. And Blake talked about the ongoing strength of Battlefront II, and I reference the ongoing strength of Battlefield 5. As we think about balancing the portfolio around titles launch next year, and titles that will get the greatest boost of later on, what we have seen is a greater propensity for sports game players to play across both generations of title and we've seen that lift. And some of the things that we really want to do in the Battlefield franchise as it relates to the new fidelity that will really show up well inside of a Battlefield game. We'd like to have a deep install base for. So it really comes down to balancing a whole range of different things across our portfolio. But we feel very good about the opportunity to grow the business next year, and have a Battlefield tall in FY '22 that will grow there well and deliver on what our fan expectations will be for Battlefield game on next gen platforms. On the Star Wars piece, so well the rise of Skywalker is the last in this particular film set. You know, Disney had talked about having extraordinarily robust plans around that franchise over time. What we talked about was, you know, The Mandalorian coming with Disney plus the new movie And Galaxy's Edge in theme parks. And so our expectation is that in partnership with Disney, we will get the benefit of the ongoing plans around the continued development and provision of great content experiences for Star Wars fans for many years to come."

We delivered a strong start to FY '20. Players were deeply engaged in our top franchises with growing communities reaching new peaks of engagement fueled by content and in-game events in our live services. As a result, our operating results significantly exceeded our expectations for the first quarter. We're thrilled by the great experiences that players are having in our games, and we're looking forward to delivering a lot more throughout the fiscal year. Interactive entertainment continues to grow and expanding global player base [indiscernible] and tailwinds for the industry. With this backdrop, the core drivers of growth for EA are the depth and breadth of our portfolio and IP, our expertise in live services, our leadership in subscriptions and competitive gaming that expands our reach and drives deeper engagement. We're also continually strengthening our foundation of great talent and technology. I'll touch on some of these drivers with a few highlights here. Let's start with Apex Legends. We have a massive global audience continuing to engage in this high-quality free-to-play experience. Apex has tremendous gameplay at its core and we've built it to have longevity as a live service that will continue to drive engagement over time. In our live service, we're delivering seasons of new content, a collection of new content and updates that begin to roll out at the start of each season and continue throughout the course of several weeks and months. We launched Season 2 in early July, including a robust Battle Pass offering, a new character and additions to the environment. And to date, it had outperformed our expectations with significant growth in daily and weekly active players. In each season, there are in-game events that are additional drivers of engagement such as the event coming in the next few weeks that will bring new content and deliver one of the most fan-requested features since the launch of Apex. There will be more updates and in-game experiences in the weeks to come for Season 2 and Season 3 is shaping up to be even bigger. All of these elements, the fantastic core gameplay, seasons of new content and additional in-game events are designed to continually excite and engage the Apex community over the long term. We're also expanding into additional growth opportunities for Apex Legends. Esports will bring new drivers of social interaction and competition to the Apex ecosystem. Interest from teams, broadcast partners and sponsors is strong and we've had great success with our first exhibition event, including a competition at the ESPYS that was broadcast on ESPN and ABC. We'll have around 8 teams from around the world participating in our first official competition in September. Our plan is to bring Apex Legends to China and a worldwide mobile launch are also on course, and we will share more on our plans in the future. In our EA SPORTS portfolio, our franchises like Madden NFL and FIFA are delivering for core fans, innovating to reach new players and leading our growth in esports. Looking first at Madden NFL. We continue to see deep year-round engagement in the franchise. Live service events and tie-in content with the NFL Draft drove growth in new players joining Madden NFL 19 in Q1 and also deepened engagement in Madden Ultimate Team. We're now just days away from launching Madden NFL 20. The innovation in this year's game like the new Superstar X-Factor abilities, new personalized career campaign and the more fluid core gameplay are all designed to appeal to new and existing football fans. Madden NFL esports also continue to drive growing viewership. Players in our Madden NFL competitive ecosystem engaged 4x more than noncompetitors last season and our events drove record broadcast and digital viewership. We're now looking to build on that success with the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. We have partnered with all 32 NFL teams, our competitions are aligned with key big NFL season and we're welcoming major sponsors, including Pizza Hut, SNICKERS and Starbucks. Finally, the latest season of our fan favorite Madden NFL Mobile game launches tomorrow. And this year, the game is bringing back some of the classic modes that fans love as well as new innovation in social call play and customization. Through great experiences on console and PC, the ever-popular Madden NFL Mobile game and our leading esports programming, Madden NFL continues to reach and engage a wide audience of fans. Our FIFA franchise had a strong -- had a very strong Q1 with players deeply engaged in our Ultimate Team live service. Our biggest in-game event, Team of the Season, had more than 3 million players logging into FUT daily to play, the highest daily levels we've ever seen for this event. Esports of FIFA is exploding as well with our competitive modes growing faster than any other mode in FUT. Momentum is strong across our entire FIFA esports ecosystem and next week's FIFA eWorld Cup finals will be the culmination of a season that has engaged 17 official lead partners, players from 20 different nations, more than 30 live events and more than 60 million total views to date.  Looking ahead to September, FIFA 20 is set to expand our FIFA platform with a brand-new dimension of the game for players who want more personalization, customization and community. VOLTA FOOTBALL brings a street style of experience to the franchise where players can build their own characters, express themselves and play different forms of the sport in different environments around the world. That's in addition to major advancements in the core experience designed to deliver the most authentic football gameplay we've ever produced. FIFA 20 will have an unmatched breadth of top leagues, teams and players included in the game, a continuing differentiator of the authenticity in our FIFA franchise. Our licensing program is built on the strength of multiyear relationships and careful consideration of the most important players, teams and leagues that our fans love to see in the game. From console to PC, to our FIFA Mobile games in the West and China, to our FIFA Online offerings in Asia, FIFA continues to be the way that hundreds of millions of players around the world come together in their shared passion for soccer. Our Sims 4 live service also continues to be a rich and rewarding experience for our players and a strong platform for growth. The Sims 4 continues to be one of the great owned IP success stories of our portfolio and we are planning for FY '20 to be our biggest year yet of new content. Knowing that, we gave more fans a chance to get into the game through a one week promotion in May to download the base game for free. Almost 7 million players downloaded the game during that time. In addition to the base game promotion, total expansion and game pack downloads also increased 55% year-over-year in Q1. We launched our seventh expansion pack, Island Living, in late June and has already become one of the best selling packs for The Sims 4. We are fortunate to have an incredibly vibrant and creative Sims community on console, PC and mobile, and we are continuing to double down on this amazing franchise to reach new players and open up exciting new dimensions of The Sims this year. Subscription services are expanding across the industry as well. We're a pioneer and a leader in this space, having just launched our subscription on a third major platform with EA Access on the Sony PlayStation 4. We believe subscriptions can be transformative to the player experience and the gaming industry over the long term as they offer tremendous value and choice to players and greater flexibility in the games we bring to market. Our PC subscription already includes more than 220 games, 140 of which are from third-party developers. We are continually adding to this with new games from EA, from indie developers seeking to expand their reach through our EA Originals program and from our third-party partners ready to reach more players through our services. We're also working to expand our subscriptions to even more platforms. Mobile continues to be a growth opportunity for us. Live services are a key aspect of our mobile business with franchises like Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile and The Sims continuing to drive strong ongoing engagement. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes has grown to nearly 80 million players launch-to-date. Galaxy of Heroes has the most deeply engaged community of all of our mobile games and we plan to continue delivering great new content and in-game events to grow the audience this year. We've also just started pre-alpha testing for Plants vs. Zombies 3. In a market where discovering an acquisition can be challenging, Plants vs. Zombies is one of the most beloved brand in gaming. To date, we've had more than 1 billion downloads worldwide of PvZ games in mobile and we're looking forward to bringing something new to fans around the world. We're continuing to prototype and develop more bespoke mobile projects as well as new concept for cross-platform play. The mobile space is complex and competitive and our focus is on bringing more innovation and unique new experiences to mobile players. In addition to the franchises and live services that I've already mentioned, we'll be delivering many other new experiences to players throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. NHL 20 is launching in Q2 with hundreds of gameplay advancements as well as new competitive and multiplayer modes. We'll take the wraps off our new Need for Speed game heading into Gamescom in a few weeks. We have a Plants vs. Zombies shooter title coming to console and PC later this year. And the excitement and anticipation for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has been strong coming out of EA PLAY in E3 where the game received 45 award nominations and great vibes from the player community. Respawn's track record speaks for the high-quality games they develop and they have created a brand-new Star Wars story that will be a lot of fun to play when it launches this holiday. From the core game to live services that extend and enhance experience, to new ways to engage through subscriptions and competitive gaming, our focus continues to be on strong execution and delivering innovation, quality and fun for players at every turn. We're fortunate to have some of the greatest and most creative talent in the industry driving our effort to continually learn and improve. With robust, best-in-class technology powering our efforts, we're also in a position to scale and evolve with the changing needs of our players. Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We delivered operating results significantly above our expectations this quarter. And at high level, those results were driven by broad strength across our core franchises. Apex Legends continues to delight players and we are pleased with the impact of Season 2 since its launch on July 2. This quarter's result demonstrates how the power of our portfolio strategy, combined with extra content, deliver strong results even in relatively quiet quarters. I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.21 billion compared to $1.14 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $79 million. Operating expenses were $607 million compared to $622 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower sales and marketing, partially offset by continued investment in new IP. This was significantly below our forecast, driven by timing of advertising spend. Operating income was $415 million compared to $300 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $4.75, up over 400% year-on-year. Underlying EPS was well above our expectations, driven by net bookings, gross profit and operating expenses. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $158 million, up $38 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $113 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.59 billion. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $305 million, leaving $979 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.19 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $743 million, approximately flat year-on-year. It was $53 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. Digital net bookings were $701 million, up $8 million on a year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis, digital net bookings now represent 76% of our business compared to 69% a year ago. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital bookings in turn. First, live service net bookings were up 12% year-on-year to $504 million, led by Apex Legends and The Sims 4. FIFA Ultimate Team was up 11% year-on-year at a constant currency or 5% at actual exchange rates. Diving into the detail, Season 2 launched for Apex Legends at the beginning of Q2 and we're pleased with its performance with regard to both sales and engagement. We will continue to add content during the quarter with a major event in mid-August, and Season 3 will begin next quarter. We are also increasing investments in content development and marketing to continue to drive growth in Apex Legends. FIFA Online outperformed our expectation. FIFA Online 4 performed well in Korea and Southeast Asia where we have fully transitioned from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4. Meanwhile, FIFA Online 3 outperformed our expectations in China, and we are positioned well for switching over to FIFA Online 4. Finally, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 base game promotion delivered nearly 7 million new installs, and we remain on track to have the fifth consecutive year of growth in The Sims 4 following its launch in 2014. Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 17% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. Although down year-on-year, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes outperformed our expectation and maintains a highly engaged user base, leading us to be optimistic about performance and a huge year for the Star Wars franchise with new TV shows, movie and theme park launches. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $75 million, down 22% year-on-year due to last year's launch of A Way Out and FIFA 18 World Cup promotions in the quarter. 47% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Although this is up 7 percentage points year-on-year, we continue to model an annual shift of 5 percentage points, given how strongly digital Anthem -- strongly the digital side of Anthem was during the launch last quarter. Before discussing guidance, I'd like to highlight that there were three income tax events in the quarter that impacted our GAAP Q1 results and our full year GAAP guidance. Please refer to our press release for those -- for details on those tax events. As a result, we expect to recognize a $1.7 billion benefit in the fiscal year, which is $200 million better than we included in our guidance last quarter, although the phasing of the benefits between Q1 and Q2 has changed since we gave that guidance. $1.08 billion of this amount was recognized in the first quarter and the remaining $620 million will be recognized when the Swiss tax rates change, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. We do not expect the above events to impact our FY '20 operating cash flow or our management tax rate for fiscal 2020. Now turning to guidance. Except for the increase of our tax benefit of $200 million or $0.66 a share on GAAP EPS, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect The Sims 4 and Apex Legends to each deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We are holding our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.575 billion, with CapEx still expected to be $125 million and free cash flow of around $1.45 billion. For the second quarter, we continue to expect net revenue of $1.315 billion, cost of revenue to be $407 million and operating expenses of $679 million. This results in earnings per share of $2.60 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.23 billion. We're very excited about the Madden NFL launch and the upcoming Apex Legends event and the launch of FIFA 20 with VOLTA FOOTBALL at the end of the quarter. We over-delivered this quarter as a result of the performance of our core franchises. These evergreen live services provide a tremendously solid base for our business and enable us to invest in new opportunities to innovate and to take risks. We are unique among our peers in this and it is no consequence that we are a leader in cloud gaming, subscriptions and in the strength of our player networks. People will only engage with our games if they have fun playing them, and we continue to invest in keeping them fun, whether it's in major innovations such as VOLTA FOOTBALL in FIFA or new modes, events and legends in Apex Legends or even adding laundry to The Sims 4. We aim to give players content they want to play. If we're successful in that, we're successful as a business. The combination of core plus innovation plus fun will drive our success through the year. Coming up in August, we have more live services for our newest franchise, Apex Legends, and the latest installment in one of our most storied Madden NFL. FIFA 20 launches right at the end of the quarter. The following quarter, we have a new IP, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Simultaneously, we continue to invest in more new IP and new technologies and new business models. We believe we have the right ingredients in place to deliver fun for our players and success for our business. And I look forward to reporting on our progress to you next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. The world loves to play games. As the global gaming audience continues to grow and spend more time with the games they love, interactive entertainment is an increasingly important part of our daily life. At the heart of this is social connection, the unique ability that games have to connect and inspire players to be part of a shared experience. New platforms, new technologies and new ways to engage will continue to fuel growth for the industry. And through these opportunities, we are positioning EA to lead. It begins with great games that can fulfill the motivations of a diverse global player base. We continue to invest across our portfolio to deliver the depth, breadth and quality of experiences that players seek. Our top titles across sports, simulation, shooters and racing connect hundreds of millions of players on console, PC and mobile. We create experiences in some of the most popular owned IP in the industry, including The Sims, Battlefield, Need for Speed and Plants vs. Zombies. We've introduced powerful new IP like Apex Legends and we are building new licensed experiences like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Our pipeline is full of innovative new projects for our current franchises, new IP and plans to revisit some of our fan favorite brands as we continually work to bring more high-quality games to our players across a growing number of platforms and devices. Live services enable us to build powerful communities where players come together and continue to share in the experiences they love. We've had great success building deeply engaged long-term communities in Ultimate Team, The Sims, Battlefield, Star Wars and more. And now, we're adding that with our massive player base in Apex Legends. Each live service is different, designed uniquely for the community it serves. They also enable us to continually learn from our players, their feedback and their motivations so we can drive more innovation and creative exploration in the future. Interactive entertainment today transcends the act of playing a game. New ways to engage like esports are becoming just as important. With FIFA and Madden, we have the largest esports ecosystem in sports games, and Apex Legends is going to be a major new addition to the global competitive gaming scene this year. We believe that our games can make competition accessible to everyone with the opportunities to bring competitive play to more of our franchises. And we look forward to delivering for more players, viewers, sponsors and broadcasters around the world. With games becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, subscriptions offer compelling new value proposition for players. Other industries have demonstrated how subscriptions fundamentally shift consumer behavior. We consume more television content in different ways because of video subscriptions. We consume more music in different ways because of music subscription services. We believe the same is happening with games where subscriptions can offer access to great content at great value with tremendously low friction. When combined with cloud streaming, the barriers are lowered even further, making it even more compelling to jump into new games and connect with new communities.  The subscription opportunity is powerful for both players and game creators, and we're continuing to invest in our leading services on console and PC. In addition to more great games, passionate global communities and new ways to engage, there will be more transformative shifts on the horizon. The content push of progress and innovation is what sets this industry apart from every other form of entertainment. With our teams of incredibly talented developers, artists and engineers, we are working to drive creativity, quality and fun through every aspect of the player experience now and in the future. We look forward to sharing more updates in the months to come. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Andrew, Blake, it seems like FIFA Online is on a recovery path right now, but this game is still distributed only in Korea, China and Southeast Asia. And I think we have talked about this many times before, the opportunity should be global. So can you tell us where you stand between either FIFA Mobile or other things you may be doing in the background? Because it seems like the demand for this game should be multiples of the audience that you are reaching right now.\nAndrew Wilson: So again, I think we think about FIFA as a platform that brings together soccer fans or football fans depending on which country you're from together to share in their passion for the game. In any given market, that might mean going to them in different ways with different games on different platforms or different business models. Right now, we entertain probably a couple hundred million people. We see an opportunity for growth there certainly, but when you think about the offering that we have across console, PC and mobile through premium, through live services like Ultimate Team, through access to the game in subscription and free-to-play on mobile and PC in Asia, we feel like that we -- we feel like we have really strong offerings for a global player base. You should imagine that we're always thinking about how we can attract more users to the platform. That's why we are working on VOLTA for this year. We think that that's going to bring in a whole new range of players who love the game but want a different type of play than the traditional 11-on-11. And as we think about more focus going to mobile over time, we also expect that we'll continue to grow that business.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng: I'd like to better understand how you're tracking against your $300 million to $400 million bookings guidance for Apex Legends and The Sims. How much did you realize in the quarter? Are you about 25% of the way there? And how should we think about the phasing throughout the rest of the year?\nBlake Jorgensen: Well, I think as we said last quarter, you should expect that the first quarter was smaller [Technical Difficulty] remaining three quarters, Q2 through Q4, because we were still, one, experimenting; and two, we didn't have as much content. Clearly, quarter two has more content in it. We talked today about a major event that's coming in a few weeks in August that will clearly continue to drive the engagement and content, which tends to drive monetization. And you should assume -- Andrew mentioned that Q3 will have even more than Q2, so we're going to continue to build that. I would assume that the back three quarters of the year are probably all about the same size based on what we know today and larger than the first quarter. That's all I can really tell you because it's just early days and we're only one month into -- or less than 1 month into Season 2 right now. But everything's tracking to plan or better for us, and so we're very confident on the $300 million to $400 million on Apex. Obviously, Sims, we've called out that it's in the same range of $300 million to $400 million. We didn't do that before, but we wanted to remind people that our business is not based on Apex Legends alone. It's very important to us, but it's still a relatively small part of our overall business. And franchises like The Sims have been continually producing that range of revenues because we run them as a live service. And we want to make sure people understand, we have confidence in building a live service around Apex and that will continue to grow over time and we'll continue to update you as we learn more. But we know we've got amazing engagement. We have 8 million to 10 million people on a weekly basis playing the game. That's huge for us on almost any game that we see. And we'll continue to take advantage of that, keep them engaged and playing everyday.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: For me as well. First, on Apex, I was wondering more specifically what you see in reengagement with some of the early players in terms of what has drawn them back into the game? And then secondly, Sony made some comments today on third-party software sales, reducing their outlook a little bit. Was just hoping for any color from your end in terms of the preorder environment for some of the titles or the retail environment overall.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I'll hit the second piece. Andrew wants to talk about the Apex engagement, if you want.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I would just come back to the comments that Blake just shared. And we have between 8 million to 10 million people engaging in this game on a week-by-week basis. That is large by any measure. It makes it one of the -- probably the most engaging games. We have continued to see great fan sentiment inside that game. And we expect to continue to grow that audience over time. Again, when we think about Apex Legends, we set out to build something with longevity. And at the very core is a great gameplay experience. And we know that long-term engagement involves the ongoing release of new content and the ongoing running of events, both of which the team at Respawn are doing with great success, but the very core of that is a great gameplay experience. And we're building this in a way that we expect to continue to grow and continue to be a meaningful part of our business for a long time to come. And the sign of engagement that we see today lead us to believe that's possible.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. We think about this as almost like an annual title. We will continue to innovate that game and evolve that game over time and hope to believe -- I believe that we have a 10 year run ahead of us or if not more. There's so much potential and ways to change that game over time and add to that game. We think that there's just huge potential in that and that's how we're managing it. In terms of the news around Sony, I have not seen the Sony news so I don't know exactly what they said. We're not seeing any softness in our demand metrics around our titles. And thus, the reason that we reconfirmed our guidance for the full year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton from SunTrust.\nMatthew Thornton: Blake, maybe one for you and then one for Andrew, if I could quickly. Blake, just in terms of the other guidepost for the year, you talked about Apex, you talked about Sims. I think last quarter you gave us a couple more guidepost around mobile down 10% to 15%, some of the frontline unit assumptions as well. Just curious if there's any changes in those kind of assumptions versus three months ago. And then, Andrew, maybe if you could just talk just really quickly about the VOLTA mode within FIFA and how you're thinking about that impacting engagement? But also monetization, how we should kind of think through that? Any color there would be helpful.\nBlake Jorgensen: So no changes on guidance. We're pretty consistent with all of the numbers that we provided at the start of the year. And all the metrics that we've seen are leading towards that and we're feeling confident about it.\nAndrew Wilson: And on VOLTA, again, I go back to some earlier comments, is we do see FIFA like a platform and we do see our opportunity to bring together hundreds of millions of football fans around the world to experience football in a way that is meaningful to them. We do that across platforms. We do that through business models. We do that through different access models and different play models. And what we recognized with the platform at this juncture was that there was a lot of really hard-core football in there. And we expect that, that will continue to be the most meaningful part for much of the FIFA playing community. But there was also a whole group of football fans that wanted a more casual style of play. And we built that model to attract new fans. And what we have seen over time, as we have put new modes in the game, and I will use The Journey, our story-based mode that we did a few years ago now, when we started that mode, is that it brings in a whole new set of players that come in to fulfill different motivations in the game. And ultimately, they become part of the community and the richness of that community and typically move into the more competitive modes in the game like FIFA Ultimate Team and the competitive esports modes inside of Ultimate Team. And so we think about VOLTA that way. So our expectation is not that there will be an impact on monetization over the long term, but rather we are growing the aggregate size of the FIFA community. And that typically, what happens as we grow that community is those players become part of it, become enriched by it and then move more deeper into other modes in the game like Ultimate Team and our competitive esports modes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark.\nMichael Hickey: I guess on Apex, I've got a ton of questions. I'll try to limit it to a couple. But I was hopeful -- I mean, given the sort of profile of the game, the competitive aspects of it, esports is sort of a no-brainer. It's great to see you guys start to move forward to your first, I guess, state of mind in September, but maybe some more color in terms of how big esports could be in terms of driving engagement, monetization and maybe overall player feel for Apex. And then, I guess, just another add-on, mobile in China, is this still a possibility in '20? Or is this more of a fiscal '21 event now in terms of expanding insulated opportunities [indiscernible]?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. Let me hit the mobile one real quick and I'll let talk Andrew talk about esports. We did not put anything in our annual guidance for either mobile globally for Apex in China and that's because we are still obviously working with a partner but we don't have timing set up, but I would assume it's a '21 event in both cases. We'll give you more knowledge or more input as the quarters go on this year as to how that timing will evolve, but right now, I would assume nothing in '20.\nAndrew Wilson: On esports, again, what we see around the esports community more broadly is the most successful titles are those that have very, very large global player bases where social interaction and competition are at the very core of the experience. And again, I go back to Apex Legends is built as a really, really unbelievable phenomenal game in the first-person shooter category, which has, as its core motivation, both competition and social interaction. And of course, it has a million-strong global audience. So we feel very good about its appeal and its application to an esport. We've also had a series of events and our -- and we'll have our first competition featuring 80 teams later in the year. And as we think about engagement, again, as we've talked about with FIFA and Madden, engagement of competitive gaming players is typically 4x to 7x higher than noncompetitive players. So our expectation is that not only will the esports component help fuel the existing community and drive higher engagement there, but it will ultimately attract new players and new viewers and new spectators and drive higher engagement there as well. So we feel like it's going to be a very important part of the global community over the long term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital.\nGerrick Johnson: I guess the obvious question no one's asked yet, bookings should be by $50 million, EPS by $0.30, gross margin by 240 basis points, so why no increase in full year guidance?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I mean it's a good question. I think we've only raised guidance coming out of the first quarter probably once in my tenure here. And it's rare because it's such a small part of the overall year. I would -- if you look at the phasing that we do in our guidance, we basically just dumped it into the fourth quarter, not for any real reason other than that's supportive. It's no -- it's almost all catalog and we just don't know, but it's still small enough that we wanted to at least remain conservative in how we forecast. And based on what transpires in Q2, we'll then decide if we should change guidance or not, but that -- it wasn't much more complicated than that.\nGerrick Johnson: Okay. Can I just dig into the gross margin for a second? That outperformed by 240 basis points, so what drove that?\nBlake Jorgensen: So we have done a faster and better job than we expected on controlling the online cost of revenue, particularly with Apex, but continue across all of our platforms. When we first started Apex, remember that you have millions of people playing, so they can be expensive games to operate, and we called that out in our Q4 earnings conference call. The team led by our CTO, Ken Moss, has worked hard to try to continue to bring down those costs through either different partners or simply how we're operating the game, and I think we've done better than we thought. And we had a bigger digital quarter than we actually expected. We tend to play in around 5% growth of full game downloads, for example, and it was higher this year -- or this quarter. And our digital business was stronger than we had expected, so that really drove it across the board.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel from Consumer Edge Research.\nRaymond Stochel: Not just about Apex, but across all of your content that you're building, how are you thinking about the cadence of updates? Do you think players these days have expectations for a faster content drop cadence than prior? And do you think those expectations are too high now? And what changes do you need to make to hit or come close to those elevated expectations?\nAndrew Wilson: I think it's a really good question, certainly one that we see and hear a lot. The reality is we build games for a lot of different communities, and every single community is different. Some communities, of course, like a FIFA community, have a natural cadence of events that occur in the real world that we tie things to, and that makes sense for that community. A community like The Sims has a longer cadence flow. Again, we're set to have the biggest year in terms of content release this year, and we've continued to grow that franchise since launch, but it is not typically a weekly cadence of content because it doesn't make sense for that community. If we think of a game like Apex, again, it is, at its core, a great game, and so a lot of the ongoing engagement exist because it's built as a great competitive game. And so when we think about that, we think about seasons not as a onetime event, but seasons as kind of a kick-off -- as a series of events that happen kind of over weeks and months of time. We feel really good about where we're at with Season 2 on Apex. We think that we're learning as we go. Again, this is -- remember, FIFA Ultimate Team, we started this what is now over 10 years ago. It started very small. We've got much better at engaging with the community over that period of time. And now, Ultimate Team is this tremendous business for us. The same is true for The Sims, which launched in 2014. We get smarter and better in terms of understanding how to fulfill the motivations and the desires of our players. And we expect that we'll continue to learn and get better with Apex as well. One thing that we do try and avoid is that we end up purely as a content furnace with our games. We try and make games that have great gameplay that engage at their very core, and then we're able to build on engagement and fulfill motivations with additional content and additional events. But we try and avoid wherever possible finding ourselves in a position where content is the only means of driving engagement because we just feel it's harder to build longevity with that type of model over time. And we've learned that through over 10 to 15 years of live service experience.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Cohen from Stephens.\nJeffrey Cohen: Thanks for the incremental color on The Sims. It feels like that franchise would be one that would do really well on the Nintendo Switch. So I'm curious how you guys determine which platforms you'd bring the game to or games to? And is there any reason why you wouldn't want to bring that one on there?\nAndrew Wilson: Any time we're evaluating platform conversations, we are really looking at a couple of things. One, does the game really fit the profile of that platform in terms of the control or the community ecosystem? Two, do we think the community playing on that platform would appreciate the game to go there? Or would they prefer to play it somewhere else? We have a lot of data that would suggest a great many Switch owners also own a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One or a PC and very often choose to play the games that we make on those platforms even though they have a Switch and they enjoy a lot of great content on the Switch. And so there's always an evaluation process that goes on a case-by-case basis. And I wouldn't say that The Sims would never go to the Switch, but I think we're doing really, really well attracting Sims players. As we said, we did the promotion in the last couple of months and brought in 7 million new Sims players that we expect will engage in that community on a platform that is really tailored to user-generated content, creativity and customization.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger: Can I visit just a little bit at Respawn, just the resource question? It's something we get from investors a fair amount. And so obviously that studio is being taxed with some really important stuff. So I guess would love to hear your thoughts on how resourced the Apex Legends effort is, either in terms of bodies or dollars or whatever you can say? And where did that come from? And did any of that get pulled from the Star Wars effort? And just to reassure us that you've got enough on all of that. And why don't I leave at that? It's a pretty broad question.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Good question. I would offer a few pieces of feedback that I think will make you feel better about life. The first is that there are multiple teams at Respawn, very different teams as well. Again, Apex Legends is a fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter and has a bespoke team specific to that type of game. This is the team that had worked on Call of Duty many years ago, had launched Titanfall, and now Apex Legends. So this is very much their particular skill set. The Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order team is a completely different type of team led by Stig, who had been a game director on God of War, and it's all about the single player journey fantasy of being a Jedi. And so they have two discrete teams. And there's actually a third team at Respawn as well working on some new things. In addition to that, this is where scale matters in this industry. In Electronic Arts, we have a very large central group that can provide art, engineering and design help if needed across the company, and we have a number of live services teams also across the company that are well-suited for the creation of new content. And so the combination of individual teams inside Respawn that are individually staffed with their specific games in mind and the global scale of EA and the central resources that we have to help across art and engineering, we feel very, very good about our ability to sustain the needs of our global player base.\nBlake Jorgensen: We've also pulled teams from outside of Respawn to provide them resources on development if they wish to do so -- as Respawn wishes to do so. We have a large DICE team in LA, for example. We have a large live services team in Vancouver. And what we've tried to do is perfect our organization to be able to work long distance as well as in the middle of a studio. And so we've given them the opportunity to pull on any resources they want. And they're very, very conscious about how to make sure they've built the best game and they use the resources very effectively to do that, but they -- there's no shortage of resources relative to what they need.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe another big picture question. As you think medium to long term on the shift you're trying to execute on towards more subscription services and cloud-based distribution models, how do you also think about allocating resources against that longer-term goal versus maybe the shorter to medium-term transition where the industry could go through another console cycle next year and how you think about aligning resources and assets inside the company against both those transitions?\nAndrew Wilson: Another good question. And so I would start with it doesn't matter what the platform or the distribution model or the business model. What matters is that we build great games. And we are doubling down and working with great diligence across our studio organization to ensure our teams have everything they need to build great games. And that will continue to be our focus near-term, medium-term and long-term. In addition to that, again, given the scale of this company and the leadership of our CTO, Ken Moss, and what we've talked about with Project Atlas some months ago, is we're also investing for the future to ensure we don't find ourselves out of position. As a company, we started to invest in our digital platform over five years ago. I think we're still the only developer publisher with a unique ID system that carries with our players regardless of game or platform they play on. We have a single data scheme and data platform across the company and single infrastructure in security and transaction engine and these types of things. So we've been working on this model for some number of years to ensure that we are ready for the future. Now, as we think about cloud and subscription, again, we went out -- we bought a small company out of Israel that really gave us a head start in how we think about cloud fabric. We've been working on learning an organizational structure around subscription. And so we feel really good about our future there. But at the end of the day, we continue to be focused on making great games. We have seen the value of great games in games like FIFA and Madden and The Sims and Apex Legends, and we expect that we will continue deliver great games and -- but ensure that we have the technology backbone there to when the industry is ready.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I think we've obviously been doing tests and learning along the way. So we started with our subscription on EA Access on Microsoft. We've learned a lot from that. Obviously, rolled out on Origin. And then, as Andrew mentioned earlier, we just rolled out on Sony. And each of those rollouts have gotten easier and easier because we understand the technology better, but more importantly, what the consumer wants. And so it becomes more of the muscle memory of the company versus having to start a new initiative from scratch. We're working hard on moving -- building games for next year on Gen 5. I think it's obvious. I think everybody in the industry is doing that. As has happened in the past, not all games come out on Gen 5 immediately. And obviously, with games like Madden, you'd probably bring the Gen 5 game out when the Gen 5 console ships, not when Madden itself ships, but we'll be ready on Gen 5. We're very excited about it and we've been working on it for some time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies.\nAlexander Giaimo: I was just curious if we can get your updated thoughts on the overall mobile strategy. It looks like mobile bookings were down another 17% year-over-year. I know a lot of that is due to the aging of some legacy titles. So maybe just provide some color on what you're seeing there. And then with all of the smaller mobile developers out there, is this a sector where M&A might make sense?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. A good question and either -- we've not had a material shift from our stated strategy over the last couple of quarters. I think we continue to see the mobile industry grow. It's a very meaningful part of the revenue profile, of the contribution, but it's also extraordinarily competitive and it's very tough and we've seen a lot of large-scale mobile games and mobile companies in pretty serious decline over the last 6 to 12 months. We have a mobile business that still has an operating contribution of 40%. So it's very, very profitable as a mobile business. And we've held on to that and we feel very good about that. But if we think about our strategy, I would talk about it in three core categories. One is that we have some tremendous games in live service mode, and what we're seeing is the average age of the top titles on mobile is actually getting older as those games scale and it's harder and harder to break in. So when you look at games that we have like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes or Madden Mobile or FIFA globally, we feel very good about our ability to grow those live services over time and really work hard to ensure that we're filling -- fulfilling the community. The second element of that is, is that we are in a world where acquisition of new players is really, really tough and it's really hard to break into the mobile charts. We're really focusing on our IP that we believe has real resonance inside the community, and again, like Plants vs. Zombies, which has been downloaded over 1 billion times, is absolutely a candidate there. And you should expect that we will focus on our IP that we think can break out in what is otherwise a very costly acquisition market. And then third, I think you are right. There are a number of smaller mobile companies out there who have the capacity to build some great games but maybe don't have the marketing firepower to actually break into the market or the network of players that we have that they could access. And I think there will be an opportunity for some M&A over time. I don't think that's an easy path, but we're certainly out there and talking to a number of different players about how we might accelerate their otherwise senior objectives.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. If you had to think about it on priorities, I mean clearly, as we mentioned, we'll have a new Plants vs. Zombies game, a high priority for us; Apex going mobile, and that's globally a high priority for us. And FIFA and Madden remain super high priorities because they're two of our largest games. And as we talked about earlier, the global opportunity for FIFA, including China, is very large. And so we're spending a lot of time there and we'll continue to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin from Deutsche Bank.\nClayton Griffin: Blake, I just want to follow-up on what you talked about in terms of learnings coming out of -- on Microsoft EA Access and just if we can get an update on what you're seeing in terms of user behavior. I know it's early days with Sony, but what you're seeing there, relative willingness to engage with live services on those platforms. Any color there would be helpful.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I mean what we first saw and has pretty much stayed true across almost all of the platforms is that people ended up playing twice as many games as they did before they joined the service, which is kind of a no-brainer because that's what you would typically see, say, on a Netflix or a Spotify or others because you've reduced some of the friction of trial essentially. But we also find that people played their games a lot longer, meaning they found a game that they really enjoy playing that they didn't know about. And so it's the discovery aspects of where a service goes which helps a lot. And then if it has a live service on it like in Ultimate Team, they start to spend more money than they did before they went into the service. And part of that might be subscription behavior where oftentimes people think they're getting things for free and are willing to spend on them, and sometimes they just -- they found something they didn't know that they wanted to play and they get deeply engaged in it. And so we're trying to reduce the friction of trial to see new games and to learn about things that they didn't know or didn't want to spend money on getting in by giving them an amazing economic value to start a subscription, and that's stayed true across all of the platforms. And the one other piece is that you were going to wrestle within any subscription is how do you manage the churn over time and you've got to curate dropping content into the subscriptions at a fairly predictable rate so people will stay in. And we've been trying to do that by bringing third-party content in to help fill in the places where we don't have content because we don't necessarily have content every quarter. And we're thinking about how games might even change in terms of how they're developed over time to better match subscriptions. So you have more to come, but we're in a really good position. We have more subscribers than any other service in the industry by a long shot and I think a lot better experience base because of that.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one is you talked a little bit about resource allocation, kind of going back to a couple of the earlier questions, the one from Eric. Can you talk to us a little bit about what percentage of the overall R&D budget or headcount is sort of being attributed toward new potential franchises and new IP just so that investors would kind of get an idea for what could be in the pipeline as we head into 2021 and beyond? And then the second one, on NBA Live, just philosophical thoughts about potentially going free-to-play on that.\nBlake Jorgensen: Why don't I start with the first one? I'll let Andrew take the NBA question. We would say, as a rough allocation, it's probably 20% of our R&D budget. That's always hard because do you call VOLTA new IP? We certainly do internally, but it was part of this -- the FIFA team that have developed and evolved that product versus a brand-new IP from scratch that we may be working on, like an Anthem, for example. We try to do both where we're evolving games with new IP and new gameplay modes, but we also try to make sure when we're thinking about games for 2000 -- our fiscal '25 and '26 and '27, way out, where there may be a small group of people starting to ideate and generate the concepts, but you don't scale it up for a couple of years until you really get it to a status or a place where you think you are ready to build the game. But we've always kind of mixed it that way. And it's a balance between inside game teams, as I mentioned, as well as stand-alone teams that we're developing that didn't exist before. But we're comfortable with that mix.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. On NBA, we've seen some speculation but -- around free-to-play, but we don't have anything to share at this time. Our game team has been working hard. As a company and as an EA SPORTS brand, we remain committed to basketball and our partners, the NBA and the NBA Players Association. And our game keeps getting better and better every year, and we'll be excited to bring NBA Live 20 to market soon.\nBlake Jorgensen: All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We'll talk to everyone either during the quarter as we see you around the country. Appreciate all your interest. And we'll also talk to you next quarter at the earnings call. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We delivered operating results significantly above our expectations this quarter. And at high level, those results were driven by broad strength across our core franchises. Apex Legends continues to delight players and we are pleased with the impact of Season 2 since its launch on July 2. This quarter's result demonstrates how the power of our portfolio strategy, combined with extra content, deliver strong results even in relatively quiet quarters. I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.21 billion compared to $1.14 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $79 million. Operating expenses were $607 million compared to $622 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower sales and marketing, partially offset by continued investment in new IP. This was significantly below our forecast, driven by timing of advertising spend. Operating income was $415 million compared to $300 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $4.75, up over 400% year-on-year. Underlying EPS was well above our expectations, driven by net bookings, gross profit and operating expenses. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $158 million, up $38 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $113 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.59 billion. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $305 million, leaving $979 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.19 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $743 million, approximately flat year-on-year. It was $53 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. Digital net bookings were $701 million, up $8 million on a year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis, digital net bookings now represent 76% of our business compared to 69% a year ago. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital bookings in turn. First, live service net bookings were up 12% year-on-year to $504 million, led by Apex Legends and The Sims 4. FIFA Ultimate Team was up 11% year-on-year at a constant currency or 5% at actual exchange rates. Diving into the detail, Season 2 launched for Apex Legends at the beginning of Q2 and we're pleased with its performance with regard to both sales and engagement. We will continue to add content during the quarter with a major event in mid-August, and Season 3 will begin next quarter. We are also increasing investments in content development and marketing to continue to drive growth in Apex Legends. FIFA Online outperformed our expectation. FIFA Online 4 performed well in Korea and Southeast Asia where we have fully transitioned from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4. Meanwhile, FIFA Online 3 outperformed our expectations in China, and we are positioned well for switching over to FIFA Online 4. Finally, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 base game promotion delivered nearly 7 million new installs, and we remain on track to have the fifth consecutive year of growth in The Sims 4 following its launch in 2014. Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 17% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. Although down year-on-year, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes outperformed our expectation and maintains a highly engaged user base, leading us to be optimistic about performance and a huge year for the Star Wars franchise with new TV shows, movie and theme park launches. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $75 million, down 22% year-on-year due to last year's launch of A Way Out and FIFA 18 World Cup promotions in the quarter. 47% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Although this is up 7 percentage points year-on-year, we continue to model an annual shift of 5 percentage points, given how strongly digital Anthem -- strongly the digital side of Anthem was during the launch last quarter. Before discussing guidance, I'd like to highlight that there were three income tax events in the quarter that impacted our GAAP Q1 results and our full year GAAP guidance. Please refer to our press release for those -- for details on those tax events. As a result, we expect to recognize a $1.7 billion benefit in the fiscal year, which is $200 million better than we included in our guidance last quarter, although the phasing of the benefits between Q1 and Q2 has changed since we gave that guidance. $1.08 billion of this amount was recognized in the first quarter and the remaining $620 million will be recognized when the Swiss tax rates change, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. We do not expect the above events to impact our FY '20 operating cash flow or our management tax rate for fiscal 2020. Now turning to guidance. Except for the increase of our tax benefit of $200 million or $0.66 a share on GAAP EPS, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect The Sims 4 and Apex Legends to each deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We are holding our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.575 billion, with CapEx still expected to be $125 million and free cash flow of around $1.45 billion. For the second quarter, we continue to expect net revenue of $1.315 billion, cost of revenue to be $407 million and operating expenses of $679 million. This results in earnings per share of $2.60 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.23 billion. We're very excited about the Madden NFL launch and the upcoming Apex Legends event and the launch of FIFA 20 with VOLTA FOOTBALL at the end of the quarter. We over-delivered this quarter as a result of the performance of our core franchises. These evergreen live services provide a tremendously solid base for our business and enable us to invest in new opportunities to innovate and to take risks. We are unique among our peers in this and it is no consequence that we are a leader in cloud gaming, subscriptions and in the strength of our player networks. People will only engage with our games if they have fun playing them, and we continue to invest in keeping them fun, whether it's in major innovations such as VOLTA FOOTBALL in FIFA or new modes, events and legends in Apex Legends or even adding laundry to The Sims 4. We aim to give players content they want to play. If we're successful in that, we're successful as a business. The combination of core plus innovation plus fun will drive our success through the year. Coming up in August, we have more live services for our newest franchise, Apex Legends, and the latest installment in one of our most storied Madden NFL. FIFA 20 launches right at the end of the quarter. The following quarter, we have a new IP, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Simultaneously, we continue to invest in more new IP and new technologies and new business models. We believe we have the right ingredients in place to deliver fun for our players and success for our business. And I look forward to reporting on our progress to you next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Well, I think as we said last quarter, you should expect that the first quarter was smaller [Technical Difficulty] remaining three quarters, Q2 through Q4, because we were still, one, experimenting; and two, we didn't have as much content. Clearly, quarter two has more content in it. We talked today about a major event that's coming in a few weeks in August that will clearly continue to drive the engagement and content, which tends to drive monetization. And you should assume -- Andrew mentioned that Q3 will have even more than Q2, so we're going to continue to build that. I would assume that the back three quarters of the year are probably all about the same size based on what we know today and larger than the first quarter. That's all I can really tell you because it's just early days and we're only one month into -- or less than 1 month into Season 2 right now. But everything's tracking to plan or better for us, and so we're very confident on the $300 million to $400 million on Apex. Obviously, Sims, we've called out that it's in the same range of $300 million to $400 million. We didn't do that before, but we wanted to remind people that our business is not based on Apex Legends alone. It's very important to us, but it's still a relatively small part of our overall business. And franchises like The Sims have been continually producing that range of revenues because we run them as a live service. And we want to make sure people understand, we have confidence in building a live service around Apex and that will continue to grow over time and we'll continue to update you as we learn more. But we know we've got amazing engagement. We have 8 million to 10 million people on a weekly basis playing the game. That's huge for us on almost any game that we see. And we'll continue to take advantage of that, keep them engaged and playing everyday. Yes. I'll hit the second piece. Andrew wants to talk about the Apex engagement, if you want. Yes. We think about this as almost like an annual title. We will continue to innovate that game and evolve that game over time and hope to believe -- I believe that we have a 10 year run ahead of us or if not more. There's so much potential and ways to change that game over time and add to that game. We think that there's just huge potential in that and that's how we're managing it. In terms of the news around Sony, I have not seen the Sony news so I don't know exactly what they said. We're not seeing any softness in our demand metrics around our titles. And thus, the reason that we reconfirmed our guidance for the full year. So no changes on guidance. We're pretty consistent with all of the numbers that we provided at the start of the year. And all the metrics that we've seen are leading towards that and we're feeling confident about it. Yes. Let me hit the mobile one real quick and I'll let talk Andrew talk about esports. We did not put anything in our annual guidance for either mobile globally for Apex in China and that's because we are still obviously working with a partner but we don't have timing set up, but I would assume it's a '21 event in both cases. We'll give you more knowledge or more input as the quarters go on this year as to how that timing will evolve, but right now, I would assume nothing in '20. Yes. I mean it's a good question. I think we've only raised guidance coming out of the first quarter probably once in my tenure here. And it's rare because it's such a small part of the overall year. I would -- if you look at the phasing that we do in our guidance, we basically just dumped it into the fourth quarter, not for any real reason other than that's supportive. It's no -- it's almost all catalog and we just don't know, but it's still small enough that we wanted to at least remain conservative in how we forecast. And based on what transpires in Q2, we'll then decide if we should change guidance or not, but that -- it wasn't much more complicated than that. So we have done a faster and better job than we expected on controlling the online cost of revenue, particularly with Apex, but continue across all of our platforms. When we first started Apex, remember that you have millions of people playing, so they can be expensive games to operate, and we called that out in our Q4 earnings conference call. The team led by our CTO, Ken Moss, has worked hard to try to continue to bring down those costs through either different partners or simply how we're operating the game, and I think we've done better than we thought. And we had a bigger digital quarter than we actually expected. We tend to play in around 5% growth of full game downloads, for example, and it was higher this year -- or this quarter. And our digital business was stronger than we had expected, so that really drove it across the board. We've also pulled teams from outside of Respawn to provide them resources on development if they wish to do so -- as Respawn wishes to do so. We have a large DICE team in LA, for example. We have a large live services team in Vancouver. And what we've tried to do is perfect our organization to be able to work long distance as well as in the middle of a studio. And so we've given them the opportunity to pull on any resources they want. And they're very, very conscious about how to make sure they've built the best game and they use the resources very effectively to do that, but they -- there's no shortage of resources relative to what they need. Yes. I think we've obviously been doing tests and learning along the way. So we started with our subscription on EA Access on Microsoft. We've learned a lot from that. Obviously, rolled out on Origin. And then, as Andrew mentioned earlier, we just rolled out on Sony. And each of those rollouts have gotten easier and easier because we understand the technology better, but more importantly, what the consumer wants. And so it becomes more of the muscle memory of the company versus having to start a new initiative from scratch. We're working hard on moving -- building games for next year on Gen 5. I think it's obvious. I think everybody in the industry is doing that. As has happened in the past, not all games come out on Gen 5 immediately. And obviously, with games like Madden, you'd probably bring the Gen 5 game out when the Gen 5 console ships, not when Madden itself ships, but we'll be ready on Gen 5. We're very excited about it and we've been working on it for some time. Yes. If you had to think about it on priorities, I mean clearly, as we mentioned, we'll have a new Plants vs. Zombies game, a high priority for us; Apex going mobile, and that's globally a high priority for us. And FIFA and Madden remain super high priorities because they're two of our largest games. And as we talked about earlier, the global opportunity for FIFA, including China, is very large. And so we're spending a lot of time there and we'll continue to do that. Yes. I mean what we first saw and has pretty much stayed true across almost all of the platforms is that people ended up playing twice as many games as they did before they joined the service, which is kind of a no-brainer because that's what you would typically see, say, on a Netflix or a Spotify or others because you've reduced some of the friction of trial essentially. But we also find that people played their games a lot longer, meaning they found a game that they really enjoy playing that they didn't know about. And so it's the discovery aspects of where a service goes which helps a lot. And then if it has a live service on it like in Ultimate Team, they start to spend more money than they did before they went into the service. And part of that might be subscription behavior where oftentimes people think they're getting things for free and are willing to spend on them, and sometimes they just -- they found something they didn't know that they wanted to play and they get deeply engaged in it. And so we're trying to reduce the friction of trial to see new games and to learn about things that they didn't know or didn't want to spend money on getting in by giving them an amazing economic value to start a subscription, and that's stayed true across all of the platforms. And the one other piece is that you were going to wrestle within any subscription is how do you manage the churn over time and you've got to curate dropping content into the subscriptions at a fairly predictable rate so people will stay in. And we've been trying to do that by bringing third-party content in to help fill in the places where we don't have content because we don't necessarily have content every quarter. And we're thinking about how games might even change in terms of how they're developed over time to better match subscriptions. So you have more to come, but we're in a really good position. We have more subscribers than any other service in the industry by a long shot and I think a lot better experience base because of that. Why don't I start with the first one? I'll let Andrew take the NBA question. We would say, as a rough allocation, it's probably 20% of our R&D budget. That's always hard because do you call VOLTA new IP? We certainly do internally, but it was part of this -- the FIFA team that have developed and evolved that product versus a brand-new IP from scratch that we may be working on, like an Anthem, for example. We try to do both where we're evolving games with new IP and new gameplay modes, but we also try to make sure when we're thinking about games for 2000 -- our fiscal '25 and '26 and '27, way out, where there may be a small group of people starting to ideate and generate the concepts, but you don't scale it up for a couple of years until you really get it to a status or a place where you think you are ready to build the game. But we've always kind of mixed it that way. And it's a balance between inside game teams, as I mentioned, as well as stand-alone teams that we're developing that didn't exist before. But we're comfortable with that mix. All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We'll talk to everyone either during the quarter as we see you around the country. Appreciate all your interest. And we'll also talk to you next quarter at the earnings call. Thanks."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. We delivered a strong start to FY '20. Players were deeply engaged in our top franchises with growing communities reaching new peaks of engagement fueled by content and in-game events in our live services. As a result, our operating results significantly exceeded our expectations for the first quarter. We're thrilled by the great experiences that players are having in our games, and we're looking forward to delivering a lot more throughout the fiscal year. Interactive entertainment continues to grow and expanding global player base [indiscernible] and tailwinds for the industry. With this backdrop, the core drivers of growth for EA are the depth and breadth of our portfolio and IP, our expertise in live services, our leadership in subscriptions and competitive gaming that expands our reach and drives deeper engagement. We're also continually strengthening our foundation of great talent and technology. I'll touch on some of these drivers with a few highlights here. Let's start with Apex Legends. We have a massive global audience continuing to engage in this high-quality free-to-play experience. Apex has tremendous gameplay at its core and we've built it to have longevity as a live service that will continue to drive engagement over time. In our live service, we're delivering seasons of new content, a collection of new content and updates that begin to roll out at the start of each season and continue throughout the course of several weeks and months. We launched Season 2 in early July, including a robust Battle Pass offering, a new character and additions to the environment. And to date, it had outperformed our expectations with significant growth in daily and weekly active players. In each season, there are in-game events that are additional drivers of engagement such as the event coming in the next few weeks that will bring new content and deliver one of the most fan-requested features since the launch of Apex. There will be more updates and in-game experiences in the weeks to come for Season 2 and Season 3 is shaping up to be even bigger. All of these elements, the fantastic core gameplay, seasons of new content and additional in-game events are designed to continually excite and engage the Apex community over the long term. We're also expanding into additional growth opportunities for Apex Legends. Esports will bring new drivers of social interaction and competition to the Apex ecosystem. Interest from teams, broadcast partners and sponsors is strong and we've had great success with our first exhibition event, including a competition at the ESPYS that was broadcast on ESPN and ABC. We'll have around 8 teams from around the world participating in our first official competition in September. Our plan is to bring Apex Legends to China and a worldwide mobile launch are also on course, and we will share more on our plans in the future. In our EA SPORTS portfolio, our franchises like Madden NFL and FIFA are delivering for core fans, innovating to reach new players and leading our growth in esports. Looking first at Madden NFL. We continue to see deep year-round engagement in the franchise. Live service events and tie-in content with the NFL Draft drove growth in new players joining Madden NFL 19 in Q1 and also deepened engagement in Madden Ultimate Team. We're now just days away from launching Madden NFL 20. The innovation in this year's game like the new Superstar X-Factor abilities, new personalized career campaign and the more fluid core gameplay are all designed to appeal to new and existing football fans. Madden NFL esports also continue to drive growing viewership. Players in our Madden NFL competitive ecosystem engaged 4x more than noncompetitors last season and our events drove record broadcast and digital viewership. We're now looking to build on that success with the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. We have partnered with all 32 NFL teams, our competitions are aligned with key big NFL season and we're welcoming major sponsors, including Pizza Hut, SNICKERS and Starbucks. Finally, the latest season of our fan favorite Madden NFL Mobile game launches tomorrow. And this year, the game is bringing back some of the classic modes that fans love as well as new innovation in social call play and customization. Through great experiences on console and PC, the ever-popular Madden NFL Mobile game and our leading esports programming, Madden NFL continues to reach and engage a wide audience of fans. Our FIFA franchise had a strong -- had a very strong Q1 with players deeply engaged in our Ultimate Team live service. Our biggest in-game event, Team of the Season, had more than 3 million players logging into FUT daily to play, the highest daily levels we've ever seen for this event. Esports of FIFA is exploding as well with our competitive modes growing faster than any other mode in FUT. Momentum is strong across our entire FIFA esports ecosystem and next week's FIFA eWorld Cup finals will be the culmination of a season that has engaged 17 official lead partners, players from 20 different nations, more than 30 live events and more than 60 million total views to date.  Looking ahead to September, FIFA 20 is set to expand our FIFA platform with a brand-new dimension of the game for players who want more personalization, customization and community. VOLTA FOOTBALL brings a street style of experience to the franchise where players can build their own characters, express themselves and play different forms of the sport in different environments around the world. That's in addition to major advancements in the core experience designed to deliver the most authentic football gameplay we've ever produced. FIFA 20 will have an unmatched breadth of top leagues, teams and players included in the game, a continuing differentiator of the authenticity in our FIFA franchise. Our licensing program is built on the strength of multiyear relationships and careful consideration of the most important players, teams and leagues that our fans love to see in the game. From console to PC, to our FIFA Mobile games in the West and China, to our FIFA Online offerings in Asia, FIFA continues to be the way that hundreds of millions of players around the world come together in their shared passion for soccer. Our Sims 4 live service also continues to be a rich and rewarding experience for our players and a strong platform for growth. The Sims 4 continues to be one of the great owned IP success stories of our portfolio and we are planning for FY '20 to be our biggest year yet of new content. Knowing that, we gave more fans a chance to get into the game through a one week promotion in May to download the base game for free. Almost 7 million players downloaded the game during that time. In addition to the base game promotion, total expansion and game pack downloads also increased 55% year-over-year in Q1. We launched our seventh expansion pack, Island Living, in late June and has already become one of the best selling packs for The Sims 4. We are fortunate to have an incredibly vibrant and creative Sims community on console, PC and mobile, and we are continuing to double down on this amazing franchise to reach new players and open up exciting new dimensions of The Sims this year. Subscription services are expanding across the industry as well. We're a pioneer and a leader in this space, having just launched our subscription on a third major platform with EA Access on the Sony PlayStation 4. We believe subscriptions can be transformative to the player experience and the gaming industry over the long term as they offer tremendous value and choice to players and greater flexibility in the games we bring to market. Our PC subscription already includes more than 220 games, 140 of which are from third-party developers. We are continually adding to this with new games from EA, from indie developers seeking to expand their reach through our EA Originals program and from our third-party partners ready to reach more players through our services. We're also working to expand our subscriptions to even more platforms. Mobile continues to be a growth opportunity for us. Live services are a key aspect of our mobile business with franchises like Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile and The Sims continuing to drive strong ongoing engagement. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes has grown to nearly 80 million players launch-to-date. Galaxy of Heroes has the most deeply engaged community of all of our mobile games and we plan to continue delivering great new content and in-game events to grow the audience this year. We've also just started pre-alpha testing for Plants vs. Zombies 3. In a market where discovering an acquisition can be challenging, Plants vs. Zombies is one of the most beloved brand in gaming. To date, we've had more than 1 billion downloads worldwide of PvZ games in mobile and we're looking forward to bringing something new to fans around the world. We're continuing to prototype and develop more bespoke mobile projects as well as new concept for cross-platform play. The mobile space is complex and competitive and our focus is on bringing more innovation and unique new experiences to mobile players. In addition to the franchises and live services that I've already mentioned, we'll be delivering many other new experiences to players throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. NHL 20 is launching in Q2 with hundreds of gameplay advancements as well as new competitive and multiplayer modes. We'll take the wraps off our new Need for Speed game heading into Gamescom in a few weeks. We have a Plants vs. Zombies shooter title coming to console and PC later this year. And the excitement and anticipation for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has been strong coming out of EA PLAY in E3 where the game received 45 award nominations and great vibes from the player community. Respawn's track record speaks for the high-quality games they develop and they have created a brand-new Star Wars story that will be a lot of fun to play when it launches this holiday. From the core game to live services that extend and enhance experience, to new ways to engage through subscriptions and competitive gaming, our focus continues to be on strong execution and delivering innovation, quality and fun for players at every turn. We're fortunate to have some of the greatest and most creative talent in the industry driving our effort to continually learn and improve. With robust, best-in-class technology powering our efforts, we're also in a position to scale and evolve with the changing needs of our players. Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake. Thanks, Blake. The world loves to play games. As the global gaming audience continues to grow and spend more time with the games they love, interactive entertainment is an increasingly important part of our daily life. At the heart of this is social connection, the unique ability that games have to connect and inspire players to be part of a shared experience. New platforms, new technologies and new ways to engage will continue to fuel growth for the industry. And through these opportunities, we are positioning EA to lead. It begins with great games that can fulfill the motivations of a diverse global player base. We continue to invest across our portfolio to deliver the depth, breadth and quality of experiences that players seek. Our top titles across sports, simulation, shooters and racing connect hundreds of millions of players on console, PC and mobile. We create experiences in some of the most popular owned IP in the industry, including The Sims, Battlefield, Need for Speed and Plants vs. Zombies. We've introduced powerful new IP like Apex Legends and we are building new licensed experiences like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Our pipeline is full of innovative new projects for our current franchises, new IP and plans to revisit some of our fan favorite brands as we continually work to bring more high-quality games to our players across a growing number of platforms and devices. Live services enable us to build powerful communities where players come together and continue to share in the experiences they love. We've had great success building deeply engaged long-term communities in Ultimate Team, The Sims, Battlefield, Star Wars and more. And now, we're adding that with our massive player base in Apex Legends. Each live service is different, designed uniquely for the community it serves. They also enable us to continually learn from our players, their feedback and their motivations so we can drive more innovation and creative exploration in the future. Interactive entertainment today transcends the act of playing a game. New ways to engage like esports are becoming just as important. With FIFA and Madden, we have the largest esports ecosystem in sports games, and Apex Legends is going to be a major new addition to the global competitive gaming scene this year. We believe that our games can make competition accessible to everyone with the opportunities to bring competitive play to more of our franchises. And we look forward to delivering for more players, viewers, sponsors and broadcasters around the world. With games becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, subscriptions offer compelling new value proposition for players. Other industries have demonstrated how subscriptions fundamentally shift consumer behavior. We consume more television content in different ways because of video subscriptions. We consume more music in different ways because of music subscription services. We believe the same is happening with games where subscriptions can offer access to great content at great value with tremendously low friction. When combined with cloud streaming, the barriers are lowered even further, making it even more compelling to jump into new games and connect with new communities.  The subscription opportunity is powerful for both players and game creators, and we're continuing to invest in our leading services on console and PC. In addition to more great games, passionate global communities and new ways to engage, there will be more transformative shifts on the horizon. The content push of progress and innovation is what sets this industry apart from every other form of entertainment. With our teams of incredibly talented developers, artists and engineers, we are working to drive creativity, quality and fun through every aspect of the player experience now and in the future. We look forward to sharing more updates in the months to come. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. So again, I think we think about FIFA as a platform that brings together soccer fans or football fans depending on which country you're from together to share in their passion for the game. In any given market, that might mean going to them in different ways with different games on different platforms or different business models. Right now, we entertain probably a couple hundred million people. We see an opportunity for growth there certainly, but when you think about the offering that we have across console, PC and mobile through premium, through live services like Ultimate Team, through access to the game in subscription and free-to-play on mobile and PC in Asia, we feel like that we -- we feel like we have really strong offerings for a global player base. You should imagine that we're always thinking about how we can attract more users to the platform. That's why we are working on VOLTA for this year. We think that that's going to bring in a whole new range of players who love the game but want a different type of play than the traditional 11-on-11. And as we think about more focus going to mobile over time, we also expect that we'll continue to grow that business. Yes. I would just come back to the comments that Blake just shared. And we have between 8 million to 10 million people engaging in this game on a week-by-week basis. That is large by any measure. It makes it one of the -- probably the most engaging games. We have continued to see great fan sentiment inside that game. And we expect to continue to grow that audience over time. Again, when we think about Apex Legends, we set out to build something with longevity. And at the very core is a great gameplay experience. And we know that long-term engagement involves the ongoing release of new content and the ongoing running of events, both of which the team at Respawn are doing with great success, but the very core of that is a great gameplay experience. And we're building this in a way that we expect to continue to grow and continue to be a meaningful part of our business for a long time to come. And the sign of engagement that we see today lead us to believe that's possible. And on VOLTA, again, I go back to some earlier comments, is we do see FIFA like a platform and we do see our opportunity to bring together hundreds of millions of football fans around the world to experience football in a way that is meaningful to them. We do that across platforms. We do that through business models. We do that through different access models and different play models. And what we recognized with the platform at this juncture was that there was a lot of really hard-core football in there. And we expect that, that will continue to be the most meaningful part for much of the FIFA playing community. But there was also a whole group of football fans that wanted a more casual style of play. And we built that model to attract new fans. And what we have seen over time, as we have put new modes in the game, and I will use The Journey, our story-based mode that we did a few years ago now, when we started that mode, is that it brings in a whole new set of players that come in to fulfill different motivations in the game. And ultimately, they become part of the community and the richness of that community and typically move into the more competitive modes in the game like FIFA Ultimate Team and the competitive esports modes inside of Ultimate Team. And so we think about VOLTA that way. So our expectation is not that there will be an impact on monetization over the long term, but rather we are growing the aggregate size of the FIFA community. And that typically, what happens as we grow that community is those players become part of it, become enriched by it and then move more deeper into other modes in the game like Ultimate Team and our competitive esports modes. On esports, again, what we see around the esports community more broadly is the most successful titles are those that have very, very large global player bases where social interaction and competition are at the very core of the experience. And again, I go back to Apex Legends is built as a really, really unbelievable phenomenal game in the first-person shooter category, which has, as its core motivation, both competition and social interaction. And of course, it has a million-strong global audience. So we feel very good about its appeal and its application to an esport. We've also had a series of events and our -- and we'll have our first competition featuring 80 teams later in the year. And as we think about engagement, again, as we've talked about with FIFA and Madden, engagement of competitive gaming players is typically 4x to 7x higher than noncompetitive players. So our expectation is that not only will the esports component help fuel the existing community and drive higher engagement there, but it will ultimately attract new players and new viewers and new spectators and drive higher engagement there as well. So we feel like it's going to be a very important part of the global community over the long term. I think it's a really good question, certainly one that we see and hear a lot. The reality is we build games for a lot of different communities, and every single community is different. Some communities, of course, like a FIFA community, have a natural cadence of events that occur in the real world that we tie things to, and that makes sense for that community. A community like The Sims has a longer cadence flow. Again, we're set to have the biggest year in terms of content release this year, and we've continued to grow that franchise since launch, but it is not typically a weekly cadence of content because it doesn't make sense for that community. If we think of a game like Apex, again, it is, at its core, a great game, and so a lot of the ongoing engagement exist because it's built as a great competitive game. And so when we think about that, we think about seasons not as a onetime event, but seasons as kind of a kick-off -- as a series of events that happen kind of over weeks and months of time. We feel really good about where we're at with Season 2 on Apex. We think that we're learning as we go. Again, this is -- remember, FIFA Ultimate Team, we started this what is now over 10 years ago. It started very small. We've got much better at engaging with the community over that period of time. And now, Ultimate Team is this tremendous business for us. The same is true for The Sims, which launched in 2014. We get smarter and better in terms of understanding how to fulfill the motivations and the desires of our players. And we expect that we'll continue to learn and get better with Apex as well. One thing that we do try and avoid is that we end up purely as a content furnace with our games. We try and make games that have great gameplay that engage at their very core, and then we're able to build on engagement and fulfill motivations with additional content and additional events. But we try and avoid wherever possible finding ourselves in a position where content is the only means of driving engagement because we just feel it's harder to build longevity with that type of model over time. And we've learned that through over 10 to 15 years of live service experience. Any time we're evaluating platform conversations, we are really looking at a couple of things. One, does the game really fit the profile of that platform in terms of the control or the community ecosystem? Two, do we think the community playing on that platform would appreciate the game to go there? Or would they prefer to play it somewhere else? We have a lot of data that would suggest a great many Switch owners also own a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One or a PC and very often choose to play the games that we make on those platforms even though they have a Switch and they enjoy a lot of great content on the Switch. And so there's always an evaluation process that goes on a case-by-case basis. And I wouldn't say that The Sims would never go to the Switch, but I think we're doing really, really well attracting Sims players. As we said, we did the promotion in the last couple of months and brought in 7 million new Sims players that we expect will engage in that community on a platform that is really tailored to user-generated content, creativity and customization. Okay. Good question. I would offer a few pieces of feedback that I think will make you feel better about life. The first is that there are multiple teams at Respawn, very different teams as well. Again, Apex Legends is a fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter and has a bespoke team specific to that type of game. This is the team that had worked on Call of Duty many years ago, had launched Titanfall, and now Apex Legends. So this is very much their particular skill set. The Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order team is a completely different type of team led by Stig, who had been a game director on God of War, and it's all about the single player journey fantasy of being a Jedi. And so they have two discrete teams. And there's actually a third team at Respawn as well working on some new things. In addition to that, this is where scale matters in this industry. In Electronic Arts, we have a very large central group that can provide art, engineering and design help if needed across the company, and we have a number of live services teams also across the company that are well-suited for the creation of new content. And so the combination of individual teams inside Respawn that are individually staffed with their specific games in mind and the global scale of EA and the central resources that we have to help across art and engineering, we feel very, very good about our ability to sustain the needs of our global player base. Another good question. And so I would start with it doesn't matter what the platform or the distribution model or the business model. What matters is that we build great games. And we are doubling down and working with great diligence across our studio organization to ensure our teams have everything they need to build great games. And that will continue to be our focus near-term, medium-term and long-term. In addition to that, again, given the scale of this company and the leadership of our CTO, Ken Moss, and what we've talked about with Project Atlas some months ago, is we're also investing for the future to ensure we don't find ourselves out of position. As a company, we started to invest in our digital platform over five years ago. I think we're still the only developer publisher with a unique ID system that carries with our players regardless of game or platform they play on. We have a single data scheme and data platform across the company and single infrastructure in security and transaction engine and these types of things. So we've been working on this model for some number of years to ensure that we are ready for the future. Now, as we think about cloud and subscription, again, we went out -- we bought a small company out of Israel that really gave us a head start in how we think about cloud fabric. We've been working on learning an organizational structure around subscription. And so we feel really good about our future there. But at the end of the day, we continue to be focused on making great games. We have seen the value of great games in games like FIFA and Madden and The Sims and Apex Legends, and we expect that we will continue deliver great games and -- but ensure that we have the technology backbone there to when the industry is ready. Yes. A good question and either -- we've not had a material shift from our stated strategy over the last couple of quarters. I think we continue to see the mobile industry grow. It's a very meaningful part of the revenue profile, of the contribution, but it's also extraordinarily competitive and it's very tough and we've seen a lot of large-scale mobile games and mobile companies in pretty serious decline over the last 6 to 12 months. We have a mobile business that still has an operating contribution of 40%. So it's very, very profitable as a mobile business. And we've held on to that and we feel very good about that. But if we think about our strategy, I would talk about it in three core categories. One is that we have some tremendous games in live service mode, and what we're seeing is the average age of the top titles on mobile is actually getting older as those games scale and it's harder and harder to break in. So when you look at games that we have like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes or Madden Mobile or FIFA globally, we feel very good about our ability to grow those live services over time and really work hard to ensure that we're filling -- fulfilling the community. The second element of that is, is that we are in a world where acquisition of new players is really, really tough and it's really hard to break into the mobile charts. We're really focusing on our IP that we believe has real resonance inside the community, and again, like Plants vs. Zombies, which has been downloaded over 1 billion times, is absolutely a candidate there. And you should expect that we will focus on our IP that we think can break out in what is otherwise a very costly acquisition market. And then third, I think you are right. There are a number of smaller mobile companies out there who have the capacity to build some great games but maybe don't have the marketing firepower to actually break into the market or the network of players that we have that they could access. And I think there will be an opportunity for some M&A over time. I don't think that's an easy path, but we're certainly out there and talking to a number of different players about how we might accelerate their otherwise senior objectives. Yes. On NBA, we've seen some speculation but -- around free-to-play, but we don't have anything to share at this time. Our game team has been working hard. As a company and as an EA SPORTS brand, we remain committed to basketball and our partners, the NBA and the NBA Players Association. And our game keeps getting better and better every year, and we'll be excited to bring NBA Live 20 to market soon. Thank you."

I hope this finds all of you staying healthy and well. I want to start today by saying welcome to our newest teammates from Codemasters, Glu Mobile, and Metalhead Software. We\u2019re very excited to have added these incredibly talented teams to the EA family, and we\u2019re looking forward to creating some amazing new experiences together. FY2021 was a record year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our games continues to expand worldwide, leading industry transformation and fueling demand from a new generation of players that will continue for years to come. We delivered 13 new games in FY 2021, and welcomed more than 42 million new players to our network of more than 500 million unique accounts. The tremendous engagement across our leading live services is a powerful demonstration of how players are coming together and forming social networks through our experiences. We drove net bookings growth of more than $600 million above our original guidance for the fiscal year, and achieved bottom line results significantly ahead of our expectations. Our teams continue to deliver for our players despite the challenges of the pandemic, and our execution of long-term strategies to create exceptional, high-quality experiences, drive growth through our leading live services, and expand our reach to more players, are continuing to build strength in our business. As we look forward into FY2022, we are accelerating, powered by organic growth in our existing business, development of new businesses, and layering in growth from recent acquisitions. We\u2019re forecasting strong growth in FY2022. Our net bookings guidance reflects 18% year-over-year growth to $7.3 billion. This includes organic growth in our core business and the addition of the Glu, Codemasters and Metalhead acquisitions. From this position of strength, we are also investing in the future of our business, and we expect to continue to grow underlying profitability. I want to spend time today on three primary growth drivers for us in FY2022: expanding the EA SPORTS business, growing our Apex Legends and Battlefield franchises, and our mobile growth strategy. We have a foundational strategy for growing these blockbuster brands that we are applying here: best-in-class premium experiences, deeply engaging live services that create social networks in our games, and expansion to more platforms, new business models, and new geographies. This model is how we\u2019ve built FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL and The Sims into some of the most successful, global live service businesses in the industry, and we are applying it as a blueprint across our franchises. As the undisputed leader in sports games, EA SPORTS is moving from strength to strength as we grow our current business and include more sports and reach new audiences. In FY2021, our EA SPORTS games brought players together at record levels. Our EA SPORTS FIFA experiences continue to engage more than 100 million players worldwide. More than 20 million players played FIFA Ultimate Team in the last year, and FIFA Ultimate Team matches were up an incredible 180%. Madden NFL had its biggest year ever, and games across our EA SPORTS portfolio continue to acquire more players than ever before. We\u2019ll now build on that strength with a massive year of innovation and expansion. All of our new EA SPORTS games in FY2022 are designed for next-gen console platforms, including FIFA, Madden, NHL and EA SPORTS PGA Tour, our return to golf that is set for Q4 of this year. We\u2019re very excited by the opportunity to deliver for baseball fans around the world with the addition of Super Mega Baseball from Metalhead Software, and MLB TapSports Baseball on mobile from the Glu team. EA SPORTS is also publishing the highest-rated sports franchise in the world with F1 2021, our first title from our recently-completed Codemasters acquisition. And with the combined expertise of the Glu and EA teams focused on engaging more sports fans, we plan to grow our sports mobile business by over 50% this year. We continue to see the consumption of sports move from linear to interactive, representing a major growth opportunity for us spanning more sports and more platforms, especially mobile. From premium experiences to live services to mobile, EA SPORTS is in an unparalleled position to reach more players with new ways to play, watch and connect. With Apex Legends and Battlefield, we have two leading franchises in their category. We are positioned for continued growth in FY2022 through new launches, expansion to mobile, and preparing for the addition of new business models that will expand our total addressable audience. Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year and we are forecasting continued growth. Season 8 saw well over 12 million weekly active users, the highest levels we\u2019ve seen since season 1 in 2019. We\u2019re also seeing explosive growth for Apex in Asia, especially in Japan where it has grown significantly in the last three quarters. As Respawn continues to deliver more new content and evolve the main game this year, we are also beginning regional beta testing of Apex Legends Mobile. This is a new experience designed specifically for touchscreens, which we expect to launch worldwide later this fiscal year. Apex Legends continues to have tremendous momentum and is growing in every dimension. We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY2022, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game. We are realizing the next phase of growth in our vision for Battlefield with two new experiences launching in FY2022. Three world-class studios, DICE Stockholm, Criterion and DICE LA, and our technology team in Gothenburg now form our largest-ever Battlefield development team. They are working in lock-step to deliver the definitive next-gen experience for Battlefield fans. The game has everything fans love about Battlefield, epic scale, all-out warfare, unexpected moments and game-changing destruction, and takes it all to the next level through the power of next-gen consoles and PCs. We\u2019re excited to reveal the game to fans next month and share a lot more about the game throughout the summer. We also have a Battlefield game for mobile platforms in development at Industrial Toys, in close partnership with DICE. Built from the ground up for mobile, the game is going into early testing now, and we\u2019re looking forward to players around the world getting their hands on this innovative Battlefield experience later in FY2022. As I mentioned before, our strategy is to grow Battlefield as we have with our other blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Apex, best-in-class gameplay, deeply-engaging live service, a new mobile experience, and more ways to play that we will introduce to reach more players all over the world. Throughout FY2022, we will continue transforming mobile into a growth center for our business. With the recent re-organization and hiring of new leadership and talent into our EA mobile teams, we are in position to maximize our leading mobile live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, The Sims and Real Racing, by growing player acquisition, deepening engagement and player investment, and driving new opportunities in non-western markets. We will grow in sports mobile with innovation in our leading franchises including FIFA, Madden, and UFC, as well as the addition of MLB TapSports Baseball to our mobile sports portfolio. We expect our two biggest shooter franchises to launch on mobile for the first time in FY2022, which is another demonstration of our multi-platform strategy for leading global franchises. With the addition of Glu layered onto our EA mobile growth plans, we expect to more than double our mobile business to $2 billion in annual net bookings within the next three years. We have a year of strong growth ahead in FY2022, and we see many more opportunities as we continue to lead in the expansion and transformation of the industry. We have a very clear long-term growth strategy for our biggest blockbuster franchises. This is the foundation of our business, and you\u2019re seeing us grow all major platforms and business models. We\u2019re thrilled to have the teams from Codemasters, Glu and Metalhead join our Electronic Arts family, and together we expect to develop many games and experiences that will delight our growing player base and be catalysts for growth in the years to come. We have a deep pipeline of new content, including new franchises and new IP, deeper focus on mobile games, and experiences that will lean into user-generated content. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in opportunities where we have differentiated ability to reach and engage more players including our growing subscription service, and our esports content and competitions that will expand in scope this year. The three growth drivers that I\u2019ve focused on today, expanding our EA SPORTS portfolio, growing our blockbuster shooter franchises, and the transformation of our mobile business, provide clear growth and significant upside for Electronic Arts in FY2022 and beyond. We\u2019re excited to bring some amazing new games and content to our players and viewers around the world this year. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake.\nA - Blake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, driven by live services, primarily, an extraordinary performance by Apex Legends. GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Apex\u2019s phenomenal engagement stats. As a result of that engagement, Apex delivered its largest net bookings quarter on record. It also delivered the best day, the best 24-hour period, the best week, the best month and best in-game event. We suggested it would deliver over $1 billion in life-to-date net bookings by the end of the quarter; it actually passed that milestone with half of the quarter to go. Apex Legends delivered over $600 million for the year, well above our original expectation of $300 million to $400 million. Importantly, Apex Legends steadily grew through the last year. While Apex surely benefited from a stay-at-home tailwind, the upwards trajectory is driven by the game teams and the content they are delivering. That is, this strength is structural. To this point, Season 8 was the first season built by a new content team we\u2019ve put together in Vancouver, proving our ability to scale resources on our fastest-growing franchise. Our two major shooter franchises, Apex Legends and Battlefield, and our ongoing strength in Ultimate Team, provides a tremendous foundation for growth in FY2022. The addition of Glu and Codemasters accelerates this to 18% revenue growth year-on-year. I\u2019ll go through the details of our guidance in a moment. First, though, I\u2019ll start with a quick look at what we achieved in fiscal 2021. We closed out the year with $5.63 billion in net revenue. We delivered net bookings of $6.19 billion, the highest in our history, and about $640 million above our original expectations. Underlying profit was also an all-time record, as was full year operating cash flow of $1.93 billion. Of that $6.19 billion in net bookings, $4.6 billion was live services. There couldn\u2019t be a more dramatic illustration of the way the business has evolved, with our focus on engagement and ongoing entertainment now generating three-quarters of our net bookings. To give some perspective, that $4.6 billion is equivalent to the sale of around 130 million copies of console games. Digital represented 62% of our full game units sold in fiscal 2021 for consoles, up 13 percentage points from last year. Turning to Q4 specifically, the beat was driven by live services, primarily Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. Mobile also beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and SimCity BuildIt. Operating expenses came in very slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by acquisition-related expenses. Now turning now to guidance. We expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.8 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.828 billion, and earnings per share of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our two-year, $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We expect operating cash flows of $1.750 billion and capital expenditures to be around $250 million, which would deliver free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. Cash flow is down year-on-year, primarily due to tax integration costs associated with the acquisitions. The level of these costs reflect the strength of the IP Glu and Codemasters have developed and bring to EA. CapEx is up temporarily, with office build outs in Bucharest, Los Angeles, Orlando and the United Kingdom. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. We expect fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $7.3 billion, up about 18% over fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to drive strong organic growth in Apex Legends in fiscal 2022, and expand the franchise to new platforms with the launch of Apex Mobile in the back half of the year. In sports, we expect FIFA and Madden to be strong and we\u2019re launching a new PGA Tour golf game. F1 2021, developed by Codemasters and which now sits under the EA Sports banner, will launch on July 16. And, of course, rounding out the year for our shooter franchises is the launch of Battlefield in the holiday season. Because this is the first time we\u2019re forecasting Glu and Codemasters, we took a very conservative posture on net bookings from those businesses. In addition, we\u2019re not yet modeling any synergies from the two acquisitions. For fiscal 2022, we\u2019ve assumed simple addition of their existing businesses in the EA. Revenue and synergies will come further out, as we combine our IP with Glu\u2019s mobile expertise to build a suite of new casual mobile games, leverage our sports know-how with Codemasters' F1 franchise, and implement a holistic strategy for racing games. Meanwhile, OpEx this year will be impacted by some one-time costs associated with the acquisitions. We're also leaning heavily into our biggest franchises, with increased R&D investments, and marketing ahead of the key launches of Battlefield and Apex Mobile. We expect these near-term investments to pay off in years to come. For the first quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.475 billion, cost of revenue to be $287 million, and operating expenses of $955 million. This results in an earnings per share of $0.24 for the first quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.25 billion. We expect Apex Legends momentum will carry through to fiscal 2022. Given what we\u2019ve seen of the game already, we believe our financial model of Battlefield may be conservative, and we\u2019re looking forward to player reaction when we reveal this game next month. In addition, we\u2019re very excited for the franchise as a whole, as we add new platforms and business models. We expect strong organic growth this year, growth that is further accelerated by the addition of the talented teams at Codemasters and Glu and Metalhead. It is an exciting time for Electronic Arts. Now I\u2019ll hand back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up our remarks here, I want to share a heartfelt congratulations to Respawn Entertainment. The team achieved another amazing milestone last month, when they received the gaming industry's first Academy Award for co-producing the documentary short subject Colette, which was released within the Medal of Honor: Above & Beyond VR experience. Congratulations to Vince, Dusty, Peter and the entire team, it is a truly outstanding achievement, and such an incredible recognition of the creativity and passion for groundbreaking work that all of our teams put into our games. Games are bringing joy to more players around the world than ever before, and our experiences are bringing hundreds of millions of players together. Our business has never been stronger, we have clear growth drivers accelerating our trajectory in FY2022, and our acquisitions are new catalysts for growth. As we continue building blockbuster franchises with best-in-class live services that reach and connect players on more platforms and in more geographies around the world, we see significant upside for Electronic Arts this year and in the years to come. Thank you to our teams for their incredible work delivering for our players every day. Now Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. First off, Blake, it looks like services on console and PC increased almost 40% in fiscal Q4 if I have the apples to apples numbers there, right. So curious how you expect that portion of the business to track in Q1 and in the next fiscal year? And then, secondly, Andrew within core EA, it sounds like you have a pretty ambitious roadmap for new releases in live ops So I'm curious if you have the studio structure and the development team and resources in place now where you're comfortable with in order to execute in that pipeline? Or are there still some gaps that need to be filled in? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Colin. It's Blake. We've seen across the board live services increases. Clearly, Apex has driven a huge change in that business. It's up dramatically year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone year-over-year, it's up 145%. And the way we've done that as you know is continue to add amazing content, amazing characters, amazing things for people to play, and it's engaging more and more people all the time. While COVID as horrible as it has been brought a lot of people into gaming and what we've done is try to do our best to bring more and more people into social networks around the games they love, be it sports, be it shooter game, be it The Sims and that's what we've been able to leverage over time and those people stay in those social networks because they enjoy the game and enjoy the people they're playing with. And so, we see across all of our live services, Ultimate Team, Apex, The Sims, all of our mobile games that have helped us get the confidence that we could give the guidance that we just provided for next year. And I think you're going to continue to see that as a huge part of our business. It's going to be a huge part of the industry business as we've already seen, but it will continue on for us and we'll continue to add to that with new content, new ways to play, new opportunities for people to deeply get connected with other people that like what they like to do.\nAndrew Wilson: And on the same question, great question, we feel really good about our studio organization, as you heard in the prepared remarks and you've heard me talk about before over the last year we really reorganized our mobile group. We brought in new leadership, both at the very top of the organization and throughout the organization, who really bring great global expertise and experience and knowledge and know-how, and of course, bringing in Codemasters \u2013 bringing in Glu Mobile to that group puts us in a really, really strong position for an increased focus on mobile, where we see tremendous growth opportunity. Across the rest of our studio structure, I also feel really, really good about our leadership and all of our creative talent there. Again, we've brought in Codemasters, which are some of the leading racing developers in the world. You'll see more from us around our holistic racing strategy, but F1 is already looking really, really strong for this year. And we've been recruiting over the last 12 to 18 months, some amazing industry-leading talent, some of those have been announced, some announced yet, but we have a very ambitious growth plan ahead and we feel really good about the structure we have in place. Of course we'll always be tuning and balancing that all the time, but I feel blessed and lucky to have the creative leadership and the creative talent that we do to achieve the things that we have planned.\nColin Sebastian: All right. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay, thank you. So, Andrew, Blake I think investors have been waiting for the audience unlock from mobile for some time now, particularly as it comes to your larger franchises. So, can you talk about the initial integration plans with the good folks at Glu and you know what that might look like from a franchise by franchise standpoint? So, what are the opportunities to get you to one plus one to be more than two so that, Blake, your forecasting guidance parameters that's going to be greater than just a straight forward addition of these on to EA's existing results. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: I would say from a philosophical standpoint, our orientation around Glu is to protect and amplify ensure that we protect the creative integrity, the cultural integrity of that organization. They have been very, very successful in developing great games like Design Home and Tap Sports Baseball and many others. But we also want to give them access to our IP, to our technology, to our market, our global marketing reach and the network of 500 million unique accounts that we have and we feel that the combination of those two things represents an extraordinary opportunity. But at the same time also been working on our organic \u2013 on the EA model team around organic growth and you\u2019ve heard me talk about significant increase in the S&R [indiscernible] franchise, a relaunch of Madden and UFC, aggressive plans around The Sims and a number of other properties including Battlefield and Apex Legends. And so our sense is we expect with the reorganization and focus on mobile, bringing in Glu to the organization with kind of protect and amplify orientation and the collective growth plans that we have an investment that we\u2019re making, we have tremendous upside opportunity at a time where brands are breaking through more stronger than most anything else in the mobile market.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, maybe but follow-on to Stephen\u2019s question. And that\u2019s around with all the M&A activity you\u2019ve seen on the mobile side, AppLovin and Machine Zone, and then they also just bought Adjust and then you guys the Glu and Zynga with Chartboost. Is the mobile piece, the advertising piece of that and the cross platform piece is that an initiative that\u2019s going to kind of catalyze a more vertically integrated approach to the business, a more holistic and robust approach to consumer engagement and how you monetize those guys lifetime value yield perspective. Are you missing anything on the ad tech side, do you think for premier kind of holistic mobile approach?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, I would say it\u2019s too early to say on ad tech. We know there is a lot of changes going on in the market as you guys know and we\u2019ll watch closely as to how those changes may impact advertising inside of the mobile games. We also know that most mobile gaming advertising is for other mobile games and we\u2019ve always wanted to try to keep people in our own network, right or wrong, but that\u2019s been our focus. I think the near-term opportunity is really the talent that these teams have that could impact our own franchises in the IP that we have in those franchises. So building more casual games for example, building new sports games. I think that\u2019s where we were most excited about Glu and the reason we bought them. And I think longer-term, over the next couple of years as we see how the ad business changes, we might be more aggressive there, but really this is about building new franchises with great talent.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Got it. Thanks Blake, appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Hi, thank you. Can you elaborate on the success, the tremendous success you\u2019ve seen in Apex Legends? I mean is it a core group of players playing the game more and more season after season? Or have you notably expanded the player bases well? And any update on timeline of Apex for China?\nAndrew Wilson: I would say as we look at the data on Apex Legends, we have seen from season to season, what the Apex Legends team have been able to do is grow pretty much every meaningful metric around the business. The amount of players, the amount of time players spend, the amount of connections players have in the game, the amount of touch point the players have and of course revenue generation from that growing player base. I think as we project forward, what they have done from the very beginning is ensure that they always protect the gaming community, but they\u2019re very close and listen to the gaming community offering what that community wants, the day to day retention is off the charts for free to play game and that\u2019s why we are confident in projecting future growth around both the existing base and then of course Apex Mobile. And what we talked about is releasing or soft launching Apex Mobile later this year as is the nature of mobile games, we have a series of closed beta tests, open beta tests and then soft launches to ensure we are appropriately treating the metrics. We\u2019ve not gotten big numbers in our plan this year forward, Blake can comment more on that. But what we\u2019ve really done is apply the same orientation the team has had around the core franchise, which is let\u2019s make sure we get the game play right, let\u2019s make sure we get the event strategy around the game play right and let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re looking at players and delivering on what players want out of that experience. That is growing every meaningful metric of Apex Legends every single season since launch and our expectation is that we\u2019ll also be able to grow that in the same way in mobile.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, and we\u2019ve put really \u2013 as I think Andrew mentioned in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve put relatively little revenue in for Apex Mobile in this coming year because you don\u2019t know exactly when you will release the mobile game. You want to make sure you test it, tune it and then release it at the right time and that\u2019s globally, including China. We believe there are some huge markets for Apex mobile, as Andrew also mentioned, Japan is one of our largest markets for the console and PC game and the switch game. And so, we believe it will be a huge market for mobile, so we will prioritize some of those markets, but we also know people love the game all around the world, so more to come on that. I would just trust that we have not put a large number in our forecast for Apex mobile yet, because of some of those unknowns.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng: Hi, thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the comment about how the new EA SPORTS or design for next-gen, what does that enable from a pricing perspective. And then separately, I think, you made similar comments around Battlefield as well. For Battlefield, specifically, will that be available for both current gen and next-gen? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: So yes, Battlefield will be available for both current gen and next-gen as well as sports titles. The reference specifically from our prepared remarks is around the nature of game play, what we can do with fidelity of the game, what we can do with physics, artificial intelligence and the immersive nature of the game. And in the case of Battlefield, what we can do with respect to the amount of plays that we can have in the game and the nature of destruction of those only in Battlefield moments that are truly next-gen opportunities that we\u2019re able to do in the context of our next-gen franchises, because of the increased processing power in memory and output of the new consoles. We\u2019re really excited about that what that means for our products. If you go back to the history of our industry, every time we were able to deliver high fidelity, more meaningfully immersive products as a result of increased processing powered platform transitions, we\u2019ve been able to grow the market dramatically. And sports and games like Battlefield have been leaders on that every platform generation shift. And we\u2019re excited by the fact our entire EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield will be developed specifically around features for next-gen players.\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you very much. And just a follow-up if I may. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Ultimate Team live services content in the quarter and if you have any outlook for the year. Are there any notable events that you\u2019ll be rolling out? And sorry if I missed it, but did you talk about Ultimate Team growth in the quarter? Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, we didn\u2019t call out Ultimate Team growth in the coming quarter, which we don\u2019t typically do. We just talked about Ultimate Team growth in last quarter, which year-over-year it was up 30%. The team has done an amazing job across all sports to find ways to continue to innovate and add new events. And that\u2019s what\u2019s always drives, brings people in to Ultimate Team and drives people to play Ultimate Team and we\u2019ve gotten better and better that over the life of the product and we\u2019ll continue to do that and we have optimism for the coming year and many years to come around all the sports Ultimate Teams because we will continue to innovate on those and look for new ways for people to play them.\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Blake. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mario Lu from Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I have one on Apex and one on Battlefield. So, the first one on Apex. I know it\u2019s only been a week since the launch, but can you comment on how the second permanent mode arena is performing versus your expectations. And do you expect this mode to kind of bring in more new players or just increasing the engagement of existing?\nAndrew Wilson: It\u2019s still too early to tell in terms of macro numbers, other than the demand was pretty incredible. First, we can add to the point where we had a few stability issues in the community, we're able to resolve those very quickly just the nature of demand was so extraordinary. In terms of do we expect that just to engage more existing players are bringing new players? I think, we believe both of those things will happen. What you have seen from the Apex team each and every season whether it\u2019s launching new maps, new characters or new modalities of play, every season has grown both players and the engagement of the existing player base and the player investment that comes from those two things. And so, it\u2019s still early to tell. I\u2019m going to say Season 8 is the biggest since Season 1 in 2019 and Season 9 as of right now looks like it will be bigger than Season 8 meaningfully so. And we\u2019re very excited about what these new modes will do. And you should expect many more new modes from Apex over the coming years.\nMario Lu: Okay, thanks. And then the one on Battlefield, the new mobile title that\u2019s coming in late fiscal 2022, I believe it\u2019s developed by Industrial Toys. So can you provide some background on how you decided to choose that studio versus partnering with one of the Chinese companies like Tencent or NetEase. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. Industrial Toys, we acquired some number of years ago now. It\u2019s led by the original team who helped to create Halo as a franchise and then it'd gone on to work in a number kind of mobile companies. And we're really committed to building a truly innovative experience around first-person shooter mechanics. When we met the team, we just feel that an incredible team. They had really unbelievable design ideas. And when we talked with them about the opportunity to work on Battlefield, they were as excited as we were. And so, we brought that team and the company a while ago now. They\u2019ve been working a number of the \u2013 a number of years through a number of cycles. And we got to a place where we\u2019re really very excited about the mechanics. It\u2019s a different kind of shooting mechanic to our Apex Legends. We believe they will speak with two very different markets both which have tremendous upside and tremendous opportunity for us and both games are coming from really talented studios.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Hickey from Benchmark Company.\nMike Hickey: Hi, Andrew, Blake. Congrats on the quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious, again on Battlefield here, if you're seeing opportunity to annualize the premium experience, obviously, you've done well with that in sports. And prior Battlefield, I think, you had some experience with the Battle Royale. I am curious if that\u2019s still a consideration for the year and for the franchise moving forward.\nAndrew Wilson: Nothing to announce at the moment on either an annualized Battlefield and/or the nature of the modes in the upcoming Battlefield game, we\u2019re going to talk about a lot around that in the months to come starting next month with our reveal trailer, which I have a chance of seeing the work in progress last week and it is incredible. What the team has been able to do in the context of next-generation consoles and epic scale battles, unbelievable player accounts, destruction in terms of those which is really incredible, and it\u2019s a very innovative and creative mode for the future of the franchise. The other thing that you should know and I talked about in the prepared remarks is we do have a blueprint, which is how do we start with our AAA premium experience that is truly innovative in its category, how do we build out live service for long-term engagement and then how do we think about modalities at play and business models to further extend our reach and penetration of that game on a global basis across platforms, across geographies, across business models. And so you\u2019ll hear a lot more from us in the months ahead, but I would just \u2013 I would finish by saying we're really excited about Battlefield, everything I\u2019ve seen in the game is spectacular. And I think it\u2019s going to be an amazing relaunch of that franchise this year and will lead us into an incredible live service for the future.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, Mike you know that we do believe that won't give the Battlefield fans many ways to play and let them play for a long time. And I think you\u2019ll see that and what we\u2019ll talk about in the future, it is an opportunity to extend the Battlefield experience for people because it is such an engaged community. I\u2019d love to tell you what I said when I saw the trailer last week, but I would \u2013 I can\u2019t because it would get censored, but it\u2019s just to emphasize Andrew\u2019s point, I think people are going to be really blown away. And I\u2019ll tell you on gen-five, it is even more spectacular, but it will be great on either console, but it\u2019s going to be very exciting, I think.\nMike Hickey: Nice, excited to play in. Last question for me, I think last call you noted that development of Battlefield is ahead of expectations, obviously you\u2019ve seen it exciting, maybe buzz building, but at the same time it looks like we view Criterion that studio to do additional work with the base. And I am just curious on the decision to do that and what your plans are for Need for Speed in the future? Thanks guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, there are two things at play here. One is we have incredible ambition around Battlefield. We\u2019ve got DICE Stockholm, DICE LA, at Criterion our technology team in Gothenburg. And our entire Frostbite team, quite honestly, focused on making this the best possible Battlefield it can be. We've made tremendous progress. The teams have unbelievable ambition to be truly creative and innovative experience. And having Criterion who have delivered some of the most amazing experiences in our history and have worked really closely with DICE in the past come together to help realize the fullness of that ambition, which is the no brainer for us this year. What has also happened, of course, as we had acquired Codemasters and a number of new racing games, including the F1 franchise, which is shaping up to be really strong this year. And it was an opportunity for us to really think more broadly about our holistic racing strategy. Need for Speed will absolutely be a meaningful part of our future. We actually think there is with the combination of EA and Codemasters, we can actually expand and extend and enhance an interesting franchise, but those two things together meant that having Criterion work on Battlefield this year was absolutely the right choice for us.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, Mike, you know that Criterion actually delivered much \u2013 associated with \u2013 or flying associated with Battlefront I and Battlefront II. They\u2019ve worked very closely with DICE for a long time. And they are experts in driving, flying the things that are really hard to do. And so, it\u2019s not the first time that we pulled them into projects and they love it. They love to be able and we\u2019ve tried to create a culture where people want to work together. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here versus some other idea that well something must be wrong. No, no. This is an opportunity to put talent in at the right time and we always are measuring how that might impact future schedules. But as Andrew said, with the addition of Codemasters, we have a plethora of driving game opportunities right now that we can go after. And Criterion will continue to work on those going forward.\nMike Hickey: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be willing to discuss the pipeline for Glu and what\u2019s contemplated in fiscal 2022 net bookings guidance. They've previously planned to release a new Deer Hunter game and Table & Taste? And then separately, Blake, I think you mentioned some one-time expenses related to the Codemasters and Glu acquisitions. Are those cash or non-cash? And is it embedded in the 17% [ph] non-GAAP EPS growth that you\u2019re forecasting? And if not, what\u2019s the disconnect between that and the 18% net bookings growth that you\u2019re forecasting? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. We basically took their forecast that we used when we did the acquisition, which were fairly consistent with what they had done in the past. We didn\u2019t want to \u2013 we wanted to make sure we didn\u2019t over inflate those. We wanted to make sure we were pretty consistent with how they have talked about there for past. So you should assume they\u2019re pretty similar to what you\u2019ve seen historically. In terms of the one-time costs, they are cash costs. They are \u2013 in most cases, there might be some tax or R&D capitalization that occurs that will go into our P&L. But at the end of the day, the core cost in OpEx or things like deal fees, legal fees, closing fees, integration fees and those impact mainly the first quarter and not the full year. But there will be longer term on our GAAP EPS. There will be some accounting for acquisitions that are collection of buying in of IP, which is a positive right because they have great IP. So the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition and some one-time cash tax charges that may impact cash taxes and the cash flow. The other two that I mentioned was most likely will not impact cash flow. So but we wanted to make sure we were transparent about that. I would not worry about it because I think we will be able to continue to grow these businesses and generate higher returns off for businesses than they have in the past. And as I said, we did not put into our forecast any of the synergies associated with those acquisitions yet. More to come on that in the couple of \u2013 next couple of quarters. Just we literally just closed Glu what a few weeks ago and Codemasters a month ago. So we\u2019re just getting to a point where we truly understand what the integrations are going to look like, what cash and non-cash charges will look like, we will keep everyone informed. I would say it is not a big swing in the year on a non-GAAP side. It\u2019s only a swing on a GAAP EPS side, just because the way the accounting works for acquisition.\nDrew Crum: Okay. Thanks, Blake.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Hi, thanks gentlemen, just two quick ones. The first one, how should we read into EA Play moving into July from June? Lots of reasons why that could be move back, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that in the future of marketing for your titles. And then secondly, it sounds like Battlefield and your future for sports franchises are really trying to take advantage of next-gen consoles. How should we think about obviously some games that have tried doing that struggled on previous consoles were being too ambitious. How should we think about those titles relative to the two different generation of consoles? Thanks guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, on EA Play, I think that typically E3 govern the key promotional timeframe across most of the industry happened in June given COVID and virtual marketing and the nature of these things. I think we\u2019ve been able to kind of thinking about what\u2019s the most appropriate time line for us and given the launch schedules at our guidance we feel like July is the right time frame from that, but what I\u2019d also say is as we talked about. You\u2019ll hear a lot from us \u2013 in June and we'll kind of ramp up after that July. So it\u2019s not like you won\u2019t hear anything inform us until July. The July timeframe just optimally time for our title launches better suits us. We\u2019ve showed up in June in the past because the whole industry has at that time, while with the world that we live in now we have greater flexibility to do what\u2019s more relevant for our business. With respect to the current generation versus next generation titles or maybe we should say current generation versus past generation platform titles, I mean this is we have done exceptionally well for decades. I had a great fortunate growing up in this company and building games on multiple generations. And I think when you think about our infrastructure around our Frostbite team, our digital services teams and our game teams who have unbelievable experience getting the very best out of the past generation consoles to ensure that even as we move to the next generation, we\u2019re getting more and more out of the old generation platforms. And so those games are going to look great. When we think about new platform generations, again with the advances that we\u2019re making in Frostbite with the advances that we\u2019re making in our digital ecosystem and with the advances that we\u2019re making at a future design level with the new unlocks that come from power, the gains on next generation consoles are going to be extraordinary. And then we\u2019ve already launched FIFA and Madden on those platforms. And so, we\u2019re going into year two of those and we gain a lot of learning with our other franchises as we move into the second year of the platform.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Awesome, thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, the only other thing I would add to that is remember if our business is approaching 70% plus live services what is critical is getting people into a franchise because once they are in a franchise or in a social network with other people that love the same thing they do and that means they will engage in the live service, which means they\u2019re going to stay longer, they may spend, but most importantly it becomes something that they do for a long time, because it is that network that holds them together. If you love football, you want to engage in football with all the people that love the same thing you do, the same team, the same league, whatever it might be. So a part of the logic around building out the subscription platform on multiple vehicles is making sure we\u2019re continuing to bring people to live services, which we know people will love over time to play.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Hi, Andrew. Hi, Blake. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of quick ones from me. First on Apex, you talked about, obviously, layering in mobile growth. I guess if we think about just the base game this year, do you expect growth in the base game maybe just driven by the full year of the launch on Apex, any color there. Secondly, as it relates to Battlefield, I don\u2019t know if you can maybe give us any context as to how you\u2019re thinking about that in the fiscal 2022 guidance, maybe relative to prior precedent for the game, again any color there. And then just lastly, I\u2019m not sure if you'd be willing to buy it, but on any developments or progress you\u2019d be willing to talk about as it relates to maybe the out-year pipeline in several of the titles that you\u2019ve disclosed and discussed in the past. Thanks guys.\nBlake Jorgensen: Well, I\u2019ll start. What I would say is in our guidance we're traditionally conservative. So in our guidance for Battlefield, we have a lot of expectations, a lot of excitement, but I would tell you, we don\u2019t have a number that is unachievable there. I think we clearly can achieve it and we hope to exceed it because we know that the Battlefield title is going to be very strong. Apex we\u2019ve seen growth year or quarter-over-quarter basically since it started and we have high confidence that the team can continue to do that even before the mobile product comes out and mobile obviously will accelerate that. And I think, as we said earlier, we don\u2019t have a giant number in there for mobile this year because we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s hard to predict exactly when it goes live and monetizes. So, I think, we \u2013 if you look at our forecast, it\u2019s a large forecast, probably the biggest than we\u2019ve ever done, but I would say there is still conservatism in that forecast around both mobile, Battlefield and other titles where we are all focused on trying to grow. I can\u2019t remember what's your third question was, so apologize.\nMatthew Thornton: It was around out year content and what do we buy from that?\nAndrew Wilson: So what I would offer is I think that what we talked about earlier was we have been recruiting amazing talent into the organization from across the industry and we feel really, really good about our better strength both in the context of mobile and the context of our HD organization and you\u2019ve also seen us growing in really good ways in Asia. We\u2019ve talked about a college football game, we\u2019ve talked about a skate game, we\u2019ve talked about a new game from Motive, we talked about new game \u2013 Apex. We\u2019ve talked about a number of new FIFA titles from our mobile group and new mobile titles in Asia. I would tell you that we still feel really good and really strong about all of those that are tracking as we believe they had including a new title coming out of BioWare. So nothing new to give you beyond that other than we still feel very confident in our outgoing or out-year portfolio. And we also have some other things that we are kind of incubating that we think will further add to them in the year to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Appreciate you squeezing me here at the end, which is perfect for this question, I think, I guess I\u2019m struck having been sitting here listening that the issue how consumers will behave as we move through this next year and beyond has barely been discussed, especially given the fact that you\u2019re in a position on the calendar where you\u2019re giving us thank you for \u2013 for a year forward. So I guess I just wanted to visit that briefly in just given everything you\u2019ve observed and learned during this \u2013 have you \u2013 do you wanted to share with us what your underlying assumptions are in your guidance for however consumers are going to change their lives as we move through this? And have you basically concluded that it doesn\u2019t matter that much to your own success? Or how should we be thinking about that? I appreciate it.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, we \u2013 go ahead, sorry Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Sorry. I\u2019ll let Blake kind of get some sort of things around these, but I would say pre-pandemic, we had seen two fundamental secular trends, social interaction was moving from digital to digital and the consumption of sport and entertainment was moving from linear to interactive. So that was already happening. What happened through COVID was those two secular trends were accelerated exponentially and we sold almost all interaction happen digitally and almost all consumption of sport and much of entertainment was done to [indiscernible]. As we project forward, we don\u2019t see that going backwards in any meaningful way. In fact, we think it will continue to grow stronger as we\u2019ve really established social networks inside out of our games and inside of our network. And we're really offering players I mean in a more way to connect with the sports and leads and teams and entertainment content may love. So we think that the growth of our business, we think that \u2013 we don\u2019t think anything ever goes back to where it was before. We think this growth continues. There will, of course, be some changes as various parts of the world moves through, the post-pandemic stages, but there is notion of social interaction moves from digital to digital and the consumption of sport and entertainment moving from linear to interactive. We don\u2019t think that goes back. And we think that underpinned and it\u2019s foundational to the ongoing strength of our business going forward.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes, I just add to that. We obviously know that our Q1 last year was extremely strong, because that was when everyone essentially went home and many people even didn\u2019t work, right. So clearly, we benefited from that, but if you look at Q2 through Q4 of last year, what you saw is still strength not strength of Q1 but still strength every quarter, beating guidance every quarter, unbelievable strength across Ultimate Team, Apex and others. And to Andrew\u2019s point we were able to steer people into games and social networks that were very \u2013 for them, and they stayed around. And we\u2019re seeing that trend going forward. And even if we all go back because maybe someday normal life, which we all hope, we believe we brought a lot of new people into games and into social networks that they want to be in and they enjoy being in and we\u2019ll continue to plan. So we \u2013 no one quite knows how to predict COVID going forward, but we\u2019re very confident that we have done something that we never anticipated at the start of last year, but it is work to our advantage to bring people into games that they love and networks that they love. And we think that will help us long-term.\nBlake Jorgensen: So with that, I think that was our last question. We appreciate everybody\u2019s constant attention and help and look forward to seeing people hopefully in-person one day, but if not, by Zoom. So, thank you for everybody taking your time today.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "A - Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, driven by live services, primarily, an extraordinary performance by Apex Legends. GAAP net revenue was $1.35 billion and net bookings of $1.49 billion which were new records for Q4. Andrew gave you Apex's phenomenal engagement stats. As a result of that engagement, Apex delivered its largest net bookings quarter on record. It also delivered the best day, the best 24-hour period, the best week, the best month and best in-game event. We suggested it would deliver over $1 billion in life-to-date net bookings by the end of the quarter; it actually passed that milestone with half of the quarter to go. Apex Legends delivered over $600 million for the year, well above our original expectation of $300 million to $400 million. Importantly, Apex Legends steadily grew through the last year. While Apex surely benefited from a stay-at-home tailwind, the upwards trajectory is driven by the game teams and the content they are delivering. That is, this strength is structural. To this point, Season 8 was the first season built by a new content team we've put together in Vancouver, proving our ability to scale resources on our fastest-growing franchise. Our two major shooter franchises, Apex Legends and Battlefield, and our ongoing strength in Ultimate Team, provides a tremendous foundation for growth in FY2022. The addition of Glu and Codemasters accelerates this to 18% revenue growth year-on-year. I'll go through the details of our guidance in a moment. First, though, I'll start with a quick look at what we achieved in fiscal 2021. We closed out the year with $5.63 billion in net revenue. We delivered net bookings of $6.19 billion, the highest in our history, and about $640 million above our original expectations. Underlying profit was also an all-time record, as was full year operating cash flow of $1.93 billion. Of that $6.19 billion in net bookings, $4.6 billion was live services. There couldn't be a more dramatic illustration of the way the business has evolved, with our focus on engagement and ongoing entertainment now generating three-quarters of our net bookings. To give some perspective, that $4.6 billion is equivalent to the sale of around 130 million copies of console games. Digital represented 62% of our full game units sold in fiscal 2021 for consoles, up 13 percentage points from last year. Turning to Q4 specifically, the beat was driven by live services, primarily Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. Mobile also beat our expectations, driven by outperformance from Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and SimCity BuildIt. Operating expenses came in very slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by acquisition-related expenses. Now turning now to guidance. We expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.8 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.828 billion, and earnings per share of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our two-year, $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We expect operating cash flows of $1.750 billion and capital expenditures to be around $250 million, which would deliver free cash flow of around $1.5 billion. Cash flow is down year-on-year, primarily due to tax integration costs associated with the acquisitions. The level of these costs reflect the strength of the IP Glu and Codemasters have developed and bring to EA. CapEx is up temporarily, with office build outs in Bucharest, Los Angeles, Orlando and the United Kingdom. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. We expect fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $7.3 billion, up about 18% over fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to drive strong organic growth in Apex Legends in fiscal 2022, and expand the franchise to new platforms with the launch of Apex Mobile in the back half of the year. In sports, we expect FIFA and Madden to be strong and we're launching a new PGA Tour golf game. F1 2021, developed by Codemasters and which now sits under the EA Sports banner, will launch on July 16. And, of course, rounding out the year for our shooter franchises is the launch of Battlefield in the holiday season. Because this is the first time we're forecasting Glu and Codemasters, we took a very conservative posture on net bookings from those businesses. In addition, we're not yet modeling any synergies from the two acquisitions. For fiscal 2022, we've assumed simple addition of their existing businesses in the EA. Revenue and synergies will come further out, as we combine our IP with Glu's mobile expertise to build a suite of new casual mobile games, leverage our sports know-how with Codemasters' F1 franchise, and implement a holistic strategy for racing games. Meanwhile, OpEx this year will be impacted by some one-time costs associated with the acquisitions. We're also leaning heavily into our biggest franchises, with increased R&D investments, and marketing ahead of the key launches of Battlefield and Apex Mobile. We expect these near-term investments to pay off in years to come. For the first quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.475 billion, cost of revenue to be $287 million, and operating expenses of $955 million. This results in an earnings per share of $0.24 for the first quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.25 billion. We expect Apex Legends momentum will carry through to fiscal 2022. Given what we've seen of the game already, we believe our financial model of Battlefield may be conservative, and we're looking forward to player reaction when we reveal this game next month. In addition, we're very excited for the franchise as a whole, as we add new platforms and business models. We expect strong organic growth this year, growth that is further accelerated by the addition of the talented teams at Codemasters and Glu and Metalhead. It is an exciting time for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand back to Andrew."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I hope this finds all of you staying healthy and well. I want to start today by saying welcome to our newest teammates from Codemasters, Glu Mobile, and Metalhead Software. We're very excited to have added these incredibly talented teams to the EA family, and we're looking forward to creating some amazing new experiences together. FY2021 was a record year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our games continues to expand worldwide, leading industry transformation and fueling demand from a new generation of players that will continue for years to come. We delivered 13 new games in FY 2021, and welcomed more than 42 million new players to our network of more than 500 million unique accounts. The tremendous engagement across our leading live services is a powerful demonstration of how players are coming together and forming social networks through our experiences. We drove net bookings growth of more than $600 million above our original guidance for the fiscal year, and achieved bottom line results significantly ahead of our expectations. Our teams continue to deliver for our players despite the challenges of the pandemic, and our execution of long-term strategies to create exceptional, high-quality experiences, drive growth through our leading live services, and expand our reach to more players, are continuing to build strength in our business. As we look forward into FY2022, we are accelerating, powered by organic growth in our existing business, development of new businesses, and layering in growth from recent acquisitions. We're forecasting strong growth in FY2022. Our net bookings guidance reflects 18% year-over-year growth to $7.3 billion. This includes organic growth in our core business and the addition of the Glu, Codemasters and Metalhead acquisitions. From this position of strength, we are also investing in the future of our business, and we expect to continue to grow underlying profitability. I want to spend time today on three primary growth drivers for us in FY2022: expanding the EA SPORTS business, growing our Apex Legends and Battlefield franchises, and our mobile growth strategy. We have a foundational strategy for growing these blockbuster brands that we are applying here: best-in-class premium experiences, deeply engaging live services that create social networks in our games, and expansion to more platforms, new business models, and new geographies. This model is how we've built FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL and The Sims into some of the most successful, global live service businesses in the industry, and we are applying it as a blueprint across our franchises. As the undisputed leader in sports games, EA SPORTS is moving from strength to strength as we grow our current business and include more sports and reach new audiences. In FY2021, our EA SPORTS games brought players together at record levels. Our EA SPORTS FIFA experiences continue to engage more than 100 million players worldwide. More than 20 million players played FIFA Ultimate Team in the last year, and FIFA Ultimate Team matches were up an incredible 180%. Madden NFL had its biggest year ever, and games across our EA SPORTS portfolio continue to acquire more players than ever before. We'll now build on that strength with a massive year of innovation and expansion. All of our new EA SPORTS games in FY2022 are designed for next-gen console platforms, including FIFA, Madden, NHL and EA SPORTS PGA Tour, our return to golf that is set for Q4 of this year. We're very excited by the opportunity to deliver for baseball fans around the world with the addition of Super Mega Baseball from Metalhead Software, and MLB TapSports Baseball on mobile from the Glu team. EA SPORTS is also publishing the highest-rated sports franchise in the world with F1 2021, our first title from our recently-completed Codemasters acquisition. And with the combined expertise of the Glu and EA teams focused on engaging more sports fans, we plan to grow our sports mobile business by over 50% this year. We continue to see the consumption of sports move from linear to interactive, representing a major growth opportunity for us spanning more sports and more platforms, especially mobile. From premium experiences to live services to mobile, EA SPORTS is in an unparalleled position to reach more players with new ways to play, watch and connect. With Apex Legends and Battlefield, we have two leading franchises in their category. We are positioned for continued growth in FY2022 through new launches, expansion to mobile, and preparing for the addition of new business models that will expand our total addressable audience. Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year and we are forecasting continued growth. Season 8 saw well over 12 million weekly active users, the highest levels we've seen since season 1 in 2019. We're also seeing explosive growth for Apex in Asia, especially in Japan where it has grown significantly in the last three quarters. As Respawn continues to deliver more new content and evolve the main game this year, we are also beginning regional beta testing of Apex Legends Mobile. This is a new experience designed specifically for touchscreens, which we expect to launch worldwide later this fiscal year. Apex Legends continues to have tremendous momentum and is growing in every dimension. We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY2022, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game. We are realizing the next phase of growth in our vision for Battlefield with two new experiences launching in FY2022. Three world-class studios, DICE Stockholm, Criterion and DICE LA, and our technology team in Gothenburg now form our largest-ever Battlefield development team. They are working in lock-step to deliver the definitive next-gen experience for Battlefield fans. The game has everything fans love about Battlefield, epic scale, all-out warfare, unexpected moments and game-changing destruction, and takes it all to the next level through the power of next-gen consoles and PCs. We're excited to reveal the game to fans next month and share a lot more about the game throughout the summer. We also have a Battlefield game for mobile platforms in development at Industrial Toys, in close partnership with DICE. Built from the ground up for mobile, the game is going into early testing now, and we're looking forward to players around the world getting their hands on this innovative Battlefield experience later in FY2022. As I mentioned before, our strategy is to grow Battlefield as we have with our other blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Apex, best-in-class gameplay, deeply-engaging live service, a new mobile experience, and more ways to play that we will introduce to reach more players all over the world. Throughout FY2022, we will continue transforming mobile into a growth center for our business. With the recent re-organization and hiring of new leadership and talent into our EA mobile teams, we are in position to maximize our leading mobile live services, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, The Sims and Real Racing, by growing player acquisition, deepening engagement and player investment, and driving new opportunities in non-western markets. We will grow in sports mobile with innovation in our leading franchises including FIFA, Madden, and UFC, as well as the addition of MLB TapSports Baseball to our mobile sports portfolio. We expect our two biggest shooter franchises to launch on mobile for the first time in FY2022, which is another demonstration of our multi-platform strategy for leading global franchises. With the addition of Glu layered onto our EA mobile growth plans, we expect to more than double our mobile business to $2 billion in annual net bookings within the next three years. We have a year of strong growth ahead in FY2022, and we see many more opportunities as we continue to lead in the expansion and transformation of the industry. We have a very clear long-term growth strategy for our biggest blockbuster franchises. This is the foundation of our business, and you're seeing us grow all major platforms and business models. We're thrilled to have the teams from Codemasters, Glu and Metalhead join our Electronic Arts family, and together we expect to develop many games and experiences that will delight our growing player base and be catalysts for growth in the years to come. We have a deep pipeline of new content, including new franchises and new IP, deeper focus on mobile games, and experiences that will lean into user-generated content. We're also continuing to invest in opportunities where we have differentiated ability to reach and engage more players including our growing subscription service, and our esports content and competitions that will expand in scope this year. The three growth drivers that I've focused on today, expanding our EA SPORTS portfolio, growing our blockbuster shooter franchises, and the transformation of our mobile business, provide clear growth and significant upside for Electronic Arts in FY2022 and beyond. We're excited to bring some amazing new games and content to our players and viewers around the world this year. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Thanks, Blake. As we wrap up our remarks here, I want to share a heartfelt congratulations to Respawn Entertainment. The team achieved another amazing milestone last month, when they received the gaming industry's first Academy Award for co-producing the documentary short subject Colette, which was released within the Medal of Honor: Above & Beyond VR experience. Congratulations to Vince, Dusty, Peter and the entire team, it is a truly outstanding achievement, and such an incredible recognition of the creativity and passion for groundbreaking work that all of our teams put into our games. Games are bringing joy to more players around the world than ever before, and our experiences are bringing hundreds of millions of players together. Our business has never been stronger, we have clear growth drivers accelerating our trajectory in FY2022, and our acquisitions are new catalysts for growth. As we continue building blockbuster franchises with best-in-class live services that reach and connect players on more platforms and in more geographies around the world, we see significant upside for Electronic Arts this year and in the years to come. Thank you to our teams for their incredible work delivering for our players every day. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. And on the same question, great question, we feel really good about our studio organization, as you heard in the prepared remarks and you've heard me talk about before over the last year we really reorganized our mobile group. We brought in new leadership, both at the very top of the organization and throughout the organization, who really bring great global expertise and experience and knowledge and know-how, and of course, bringing in Codemasters \u2013 bringing in Glu Mobile to that group puts us in a really, really strong position for an increased focus on mobile, where we see tremendous growth opportunity. Across the rest of our studio structure, I also feel really, really good about our leadership and all of our creative talent there. Again, we've brought in Codemasters, which are some of the leading racing developers in the world. You'll see more from us around our holistic racing strategy, but F1 is already looking really, really strong for this year. And we've been recruiting over the last 12 to 18 months, some amazing industry-leading talent, some of those have been announced, some announced yet, but we have a very ambitious growth plan ahead and we feel really good about the structure we have in place. Of course we'll always be tuning and balancing that all the time, but I feel blessed and lucky to have the creative leadership and the creative talent that we do to achieve the things that we have planned. I would say from a philosophical standpoint, our orientation around Glu is to protect and amplify ensure that we protect the creative integrity, the cultural integrity of that organization. They have been very, very successful in developing great games like Design Home and Tap Sports Baseball and many others. But we also want to give them access to our IP, to our technology, to our market, our global marketing reach and the network of 500 million unique accounts that we have and we feel that the combination of those two things represents an extraordinary opportunity. But at the same time also been working on our organic \u2013 on the EA model team around organic growth and you've heard me talk about significant increase in the S&R [indiscernible] franchise, a relaunch of Madden and UFC, aggressive plans around The Sims and a number of other properties including Battlefield and Apex Legends. And so our sense is we expect with the reorganization and focus on mobile, bringing in Glu to the organization with kind of protect and amplify orientation and the collective growth plans that we have an investment that we're making, we have tremendous upside opportunity at a time where brands are breaking through more stronger than most anything else in the mobile market. I would say as we look at the data on Apex Legends, we have seen from season to season, what the Apex Legends team have been able to do is grow pretty much every meaningful metric around the business. The amount of players, the amount of time players spend, the amount of connections players have in the game, the amount of touch point the players have and of course revenue generation from that growing player base. I think as we project forward, what they have done from the very beginning is ensure that they always protect the gaming community, but they're very close and listen to the gaming community offering what that community wants, the day to day retention is off the charts for free to play game and that's why we are confident in projecting future growth around both the existing base and then of course Apex Mobile. And what we talked about is releasing or soft launching Apex Mobile later this year as is the nature of mobile games, we have a series of closed beta tests, open beta tests and then soft launches to ensure we are appropriately treating the metrics. We've not gotten big numbers in our plan this year forward, Blake can comment more on that. But what we've really done is apply the same orientation the team has had around the core franchise, which is let's make sure we get the game play right, let's make sure we get the event strategy around the game play right and let's make sure we're looking at players and delivering on what players want out of that experience. That is growing every meaningful metric of Apex Legends every single season since launch and our expectation is that we'll also be able to grow that in the same way in mobile. So yes, Battlefield will be available for both current gen and next-gen as well as sports titles. The reference specifically from our prepared remarks is around the nature of game play, what we can do with fidelity of the game, what we can do with physics, artificial intelligence and the immersive nature of the game. And in the case of Battlefield, what we can do with respect to the amount of plays that we can have in the game and the nature of destruction of those only in Battlefield moments that are truly next-gen opportunities that we're able to do in the context of our next-gen franchises, because of the increased processing power in memory and output of the new consoles. We're really excited about that what that means for our products. If you go back to the history of our industry, every time we were able to deliver high fidelity, more meaningfully immersive products as a result of increased processing powered platform transitions, we've been able to grow the market dramatically. And sports and games like Battlefield have been leaders on that every platform generation shift. And we're excited by the fact our entire EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield will be developed specifically around features for next-gen players. It's still too early to tell in terms of macro numbers, other than the demand was pretty incredible. First, we can add to the point where we had a few stability issues in the community, we're able to resolve those very quickly just the nature of demand was so extraordinary. In terms of do we expect that just to engage more existing players are bringing new players? I think, we believe both of those things will happen. What you have seen from the Apex team each and every season whether it's launching new maps, new characters or new modalities of play, every season has grown both players and the engagement of the existing player base and the player investment that comes from those two things. And so, it's still early to tell. I'm going to say Season 8 is the biggest since Season 1 in 2019 and Season 9 as of right now looks like it will be bigger than Season 8 meaningfully so. And we're very excited about what these new modes will do. And you should expect many more new modes from Apex over the coming years. Great question. Industrial Toys, we acquired some number of years ago now. It's led by the original team who helped to create Halo as a franchise and then it'd gone on to work in a number kind of mobile companies. And we're really committed to building a truly innovative experience around first-person shooter mechanics. When we met the team, we just feel that an incredible team. They had really unbelievable design ideas. And when we talked with them about the opportunity to work on Battlefield, they were as excited as we were. And so, we brought that team and the company a while ago now. They've been working a number of the \u2013 a number of years through a number of cycles. And we got to a place where we're really very excited about the mechanics. It's a different kind of shooting mechanic to our Apex Legends. We believe they will speak with two very different markets both which have tremendous upside and tremendous opportunity for us and both games are coming from really talented studios. Nothing to announce at the moment on either an annualized Battlefield and/or the nature of the modes in the upcoming Battlefield game, we're going to talk about a lot around that in the months to come starting next month with our reveal trailer, which I have a chance of seeing the work in progress last week and it is incredible. What the team has been able to do in the context of next-generation consoles and epic scale battles, unbelievable player accounts, destruction in terms of those which is really incredible, and it's a very innovative and creative mode for the future of the franchise. The other thing that you should know and I talked about in the prepared remarks is we do have a blueprint, which is how do we start with our AAA premium experience that is truly innovative in its category, how do we build out live service for long-term engagement and then how do we think about modalities at play and business models to further extend our reach and penetration of that game on a global basis across platforms, across geographies, across business models. And so you'll hear a lot more from us in the months ahead, but I would just \u2013 I would finish by saying we're really excited about Battlefield, everything I've seen in the game is spectacular. And I think it's going to be an amazing relaunch of that franchise this year and will lead us into an incredible live service for the future. Yes, there are two things at play here. One is we have incredible ambition around Battlefield. We've got DICE Stockholm, DICE LA, at Criterion our technology team in Gothenburg. And our entire Frostbite team, quite honestly, focused on making this the best possible Battlefield it can be. We've made tremendous progress. The teams have unbelievable ambition to be truly creative and innovative experience. And having Criterion who have delivered some of the most amazing experiences in our history and have worked really closely with DICE in the past come together to help realize the fullness of that ambition, which is the no brainer for us this year. What has also happened, of course, as we had acquired Codemasters and a number of new racing games, including the F1 franchise, which is shaping up to be really strong this year. And it was an opportunity for us to really think more broadly about our holistic racing strategy. Need for Speed will absolutely be a meaningful part of our future. We actually think there is with the combination of EA and Codemasters, we can actually expand and extend and enhance an interesting franchise, but those two things together meant that having Criterion work on Battlefield this year was absolutely the right choice for us. Yes, on EA Play, I think that typically E3 govern the key promotional timeframe across most of the industry happened in June given COVID and virtual marketing and the nature of these things. I think we've been able to kind of thinking about what's the most appropriate time line for us and given the launch schedules at our guidance we feel like July is the right time frame from that, but what I'd also say is as we talked about. You'll hear a lot from us \u2013 in June and we'll kind of ramp up after that July. So it's not like you won't hear anything inform us until July. The July timeframe just optimally time for our title launches better suits us. We've showed up in June in the past because the whole industry has at that time, while with the world that we live in now we have greater flexibility to do what's more relevant for our business. With respect to the current generation versus next generation titles or maybe we should say current generation versus past generation platform titles, I mean this is we have done exceptionally well for decades. I had a great fortunate growing up in this company and building games on multiple generations. And I think when you think about our infrastructure around our Frostbite team, our digital services teams and our game teams who have unbelievable experience getting the very best out of the past generation consoles to ensure that even as we move to the next generation, we're getting more and more out of the old generation platforms. And so those games are going to look great. When we think about new platform generations, again with the advances that we're making in Frostbite with the advances that we're making in our digital ecosystem and with the advances that we're making at a future design level with the new unlocks that come from power, the gains on next generation consoles are going to be extraordinary. And then we've already launched FIFA and Madden on those platforms. And so, we're going into year two of those and we gain a lot of learning with our other franchises as we move into the second year of the platform. So what I would offer is I think that what we talked about earlier was we have been recruiting amazing talent into the organization from across the industry and we feel really, really good about our better strength both in the context of mobile and the context of our HD organization and you've also seen us growing in really good ways in Asia. We've talked about a college football game, we've talked about a skate game, we've talked about a new game from Motive, we talked about new game \u2013 Apex. We've talked about a number of new FIFA titles from our mobile group and new mobile titles in Asia. I would tell you that we still feel really good and really strong about all of those that are tracking as we believe they had including a new title coming out of BioWare. So nothing new to give you beyond that other than we still feel very confident in our outgoing or out-year portfolio. And we also have some other things that we are kind of incubating that we think will further add to them in the year to come. Sorry. I'll let Blake kind of get some sort of things around these, but I would say pre-pandemic, we had seen two fundamental secular trends, social interaction was moving from digital to digital and the consumption of sport and entertainment was moving from linear to interactive. So that was already happening. What happened through COVID was those two secular trends were accelerated exponentially and we sold almost all interaction happen digitally and almost all consumption of sport and much of entertainment was done to [indiscernible]. As we project forward, we don't see that going backwards in any meaningful way. In fact, we think it will continue to grow stronger as we've really established social networks inside out of our games and inside of our network. And we're really offering players I mean in a more way to connect with the sports and leads and teams and entertainment content may love. So we think that the growth of our business, we think that \u2013 we don't think anything ever goes back to where it was before. We think this growth continues. There will, of course, be some changes as various parts of the world moves through, the post-pandemic stages, but there is notion of social interaction moves from digital to digital and the consumption of sport and entertainment moving from linear to interactive. We don't think that goes back. And we think that underpinned and it's foundational to the ongoing strength of our business going forward. Thank you all."

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Colin. It's Blake. We've seen across the board live services increases. Clearly, Apex has driven a huge change in that business. It's up dramatically year-over-year. In the fourth quarter alone year-over-year, it's up 145%. And the way we've done that as you know is continue to add amazing content, amazing characters, amazing things for people to play, and it's engaging more and more people all the time. While COVID as horrible as it has been brought a lot of people into gaming and what we've done is try to do our best to bring more and more people into social networks around the games they love, be it sports, be it shooter game, be it The Sims and that's what we've been able to leverage over time and those people stay in those social networks because they enjoy the game and enjoy the people they're playing with. And so, we see across all of our live services, Ultimate Team, Apex, The Sims, all of our mobile games that have helped us get the confidence that we could give the guidance that we just provided for next year. And I think you're going to continue to see that as a huge part of our business. It's going to be a huge part of the industry business as we've already seen, but it will continue on for us and we'll continue to add to that with new content, new ways to play, new opportunities for people to deeply get connected with other people that like what they like to do. Yes, I would say it's too early to say on ad tech. We know there is a lot of changes going on in the market as you guys know and we'll watch closely as to how those changes may impact advertising inside of the mobile games. We also know that most mobile gaming advertising is for other mobile games and we've always wanted to try to keep people in our own network, right or wrong, but that's been our focus. I think the near-term opportunity is really the talent that these teams have that could impact our own franchises in the IP that we have in those franchises. So building more casual games for example, building new sports games. I think that's where we were most excited about Glu and the reason we bought them. And I think longer-term, over the next couple of years as we see how the ad business changes, we might be more aggressive there, but really this is about building new franchises with great talent. Yes, and we've put really \u2013 as I think Andrew mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've put relatively little revenue in for Apex Mobile in this coming year because you don't know exactly when you will release the mobile game. You want to make sure you test it, tune it and then release it at the right time and that's globally, including China. We believe there are some huge markets for Apex mobile, as Andrew also mentioned, Japan is one of our largest markets for the console and PC game and the switch game. And so, we believe it will be a huge market for mobile, so we will prioritize some of those markets, but we also know people love the game all around the world, so more to come on that. I would just trust that we have not put a large number in our forecast for Apex mobile yet, because of some of those unknowns. Yes, we didn't call out Ultimate Team growth in the coming quarter, which we don't typically do. We just talked about Ultimate Team growth in last quarter, which year-over-year it was up 30%. The team has done an amazing job across all sports to find ways to continue to innovate and add new events. And that's what's always drives, brings people in to Ultimate Team and drives people to play Ultimate Team and we've gotten better and better that over the life of the product and we'll continue to do that and we have optimism for the coming year and many years to come around all the sports Ultimate Teams because we will continue to innovate on those and look for new ways for people to play them. Yes, Mike you know that we do believe that won't give the Battlefield fans many ways to play and let them play for a long time. And I think you'll see that and what we'll talk about in the future, it is an opportunity to extend the Battlefield experience for people because it is such an engaged community. I'd love to tell you what I said when I saw the trailer last week, but I would \u2013 I can't because it would get censored, but it's just to emphasize Andrew's point, I think people are going to be really blown away. And I'll tell you on gen-five, it is even more spectacular, but it will be great on either console, but it's going to be very exciting, I think. Yes, Mike, you know that Criterion actually delivered much \u2013 associated with \u2013 or flying associated with Battlefront I and Battlefront II. They've worked very closely with DICE for a long time. And they are experts in driving, flying the things that are really hard to do. And so, it's not the first time that we pulled them into projects and they love it. They love to be able and we've tried to create a culture where people want to work together. And I think that's what you're seeing here versus some other idea that well something must be wrong. No, no. This is an opportunity to put talent in at the right time and we always are measuring how that might impact future schedules. But as Andrew said, with the addition of Codemasters, we have a plethora of driving game opportunities right now that we can go after. And Criterion will continue to work on those going forward. Yes. We basically took their forecast that we used when we did the acquisition, which were fairly consistent with what they had done in the past. We didn't want to \u2013 we wanted to make sure we didn't over inflate those. We wanted to make sure we were pretty consistent with how they have talked about there for past. So you should assume they're pretty similar to what you've seen historically. In terms of the one-time costs, they are cash costs. They are \u2013 in most cases, there might be some tax or R&D capitalization that occurs that will go into our P&L. But at the end of the day, the core cost in OpEx or things like deal fees, legal fees, closing fees, integration fees and those impact mainly the first quarter and not the full year. But there will be longer term on our GAAP EPS. There will be some accounting for acquisitions that are collection of buying in of IP, which is a positive right because they have great IP. So the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition and some one-time cash tax charges that may impact cash taxes and the cash flow. The other two that I mentioned was most likely will not impact cash flow. So but we wanted to make sure we were transparent about that. I would not worry about it because I think we will be able to continue to grow these businesses and generate higher returns off for businesses than they have in the past. And as I said, we did not put into our forecast any of the synergies associated with those acquisitions yet. More to come on that in the couple of \u2013 next couple of quarters. Just we literally just closed Glu what a few weeks ago and Codemasters a month ago. So we're just getting to a point where we truly understand what the integrations are going to look like, what cash and non-cash charges will look like, we will keep everyone informed. I would say it is not a big swing in the year on a non-GAAP side. It's only a swing on a GAAP EPS side, just because the way the accounting works for acquisition. Yes, the only other thing I would add to that is remember if our business is approaching 70% plus live services what is critical is getting people into a franchise because once they are in a franchise or in a social network with other people that love the same thing they do and that means they will engage in the live service, which means they're going to stay longer, they may spend, but most importantly it becomes something that they do for a long time, because it is that network that holds them together. If you love football, you want to engage in football with all the people that love the same thing you do, the same team, the same league, whatever it might be. So a part of the logic around building out the subscription platform on multiple vehicles is making sure we're continuing to bring people to live services, which we know people will love over time to play. Well, I'll start. What I would say is in our guidance we're traditionally conservative. So in our guidance for Battlefield, we have a lot of expectations, a lot of excitement, but I would tell you, we don't have a number that is unachievable there. I think we clearly can achieve it and we hope to exceed it because we know that the Battlefield title is going to be very strong. Apex we've seen growth year or quarter-over-quarter basically since it started and we have high confidence that the team can continue to do that even before the mobile product comes out and mobile obviously will accelerate that. And I think, as we said earlier, we don't have a giant number in there for mobile this year because we don't \u2013 it's hard to predict exactly when it goes live and monetizes. So, I think, we \u2013 if you look at our forecast, it's a large forecast, probably the biggest than we've ever done, but I would say there is still conservatism in that forecast around both mobile, Battlefield and other titles where we are all focused on trying to grow. I can't remember what's your third question was, so apologize. Yes, we \u2013 go ahead, sorry Andrew. Yes, I just add to that. We obviously know that our Q1 last year was extremely strong, because that was when everyone essentially went home and many people even didn't work, right. So clearly, we benefited from that, but if you look at Q2 through Q4 of last year, what you saw is still strength not strength of Q1 but still strength every quarter, beating guidance every quarter, unbelievable strength across Ultimate Team, Apex and others. And to Andrew's point we were able to steer people into games and social networks that were very \u2013 for them, and they stayed around. And we're seeing that trend going forward. And even if we all go back because maybe someday normal life, which we all hope, we believe we brought a lot of new people into games and into social networks that they want to be in and they enjoy being in and we'll continue to plan. So we \u2013 no one quite knows how to predict COVID going forward, but we're very confident that we have done something that we never anticipated at the start of last year, but it is work to our advantage to bring people into games that they love and networks that they love. And we think that will help us long-term. So with that, I think that was our last question. We appreciate everybody's constant attention and help and look forward to seeing people hopefully in-person one day, but if not, by Zoom. So, thank you for everybody taking your time today."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 Fiscal 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations.

I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amid the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We\u2019ve delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter and we are raising guidance today for the remainder of FY \u201821. After starting this fiscal year with guidance for $5.55 billion in net bookings, we\u2019re now expecting to achieve nearly $6.1 billion in net bookings for the full year. And we are projecting growth in our business to continue next fiscal year. We\u2019re delivering exceptional high-quality experiences across the unmatched breadth and depth of our portfolio. We are driving growth through our live services and we are reaching new players by bringing our content and subscription to more platforms. Drilling down on these growth drivers. EA SPORTS is at the core of the sports experience for hundreds of millions of fans. More and more people, especially younger Gen Z players, are now defining their sports fandom through the games they play like FIFA, Madden, NHL and UFC. In the past fiscal year, we\u2019ve had more than 230 million people engaged with our EA SPORTS franchises and content. We delivered six new high-quality sports games in FY \u201821, including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21, on the new Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, ushering in a new generation of sports games. FIFA continues to grow on every platform. We set a new record of nearly six million daily active players in FIFA Ultimate Team in December and FUT matches have grown a staggering 177% year-over-year. FIFA Online 4 in Korea has had higher player acquisition in every quarter of this year compared to last year. And we now have nearly 21 million players in FIFA Mobile Asia. We are driving growth across our EA SPORTS portfolio. Madden NFL has more players engaged in the franchise than ever before. NHL engagement is up 13% year-over-year. And since launch, UFC 4 has consistently had 20% more daily players than our previous game. EA SPORTS is at the center of innovation, both in our games as well as how fans are connecting through our games to their friends and to the sports they love. For example, in a year where an in-person Pro Bowl event was not possible, we worked with our NFL partners to create the first-ever virtual Pro Bowl in Madden NFL 21. This was a groundbreaking experience for fans, where playing Madden actually helped to select two Pro Bowl players. The Pro Bowl itself then took place in Madden NFL 21 with Deshaun Watson and Kyler Murray leading teams of NFL stars in highly entertaining broadcast that aired on Twitch, the NFL Network and NFL social channels last Sunday. Now the Super Bowl is just a few days away and we\u2019re preparing new content in and outside non-NFL for the increasing number of players engaging with our franchise around the NFL\u2019s championship game. Events like this year\u2019s Pro Bowl demonstrate how real-world sports experiences are evolving to become interactive and you can expect to see us continue to lead here. Our fans are telling us that they want more of what EA SPORTS can deliver. They\u2019re playing more of our games than ever before. They\u2019re spending more time with our content. And they\u2019re connecting with each other, the players and teams and sports they love through our experiences. We are now set to build on our leadership position with an aggressive expansion planned for EA SPORTS. We have important announcements we are making today and more that we expect to make in the weeks ahead that will lead to more great games and content for fans and significant new growth to our company. We have a major global expansion of our soccer business under way. As the scale of our EA SPORTS FIFA player audience expands, including a growing Gen Z population, we will offer more great content on more platforms with our long-standing partners across all the top leagues and teams in the sport. We are bringing FIFA Online to new territories, including Russia, Poland and Turkey, with a combined audience of 80 million players. We are also accelerating our focus on mobile with six new soccer mobile experiences in development today for different regions and genres. EA SPORTS is the premier partner for football organizations, leagues and teams around the world. And today, we are announcing that EA SPORTS FIFA will continue to be the exclusive home of UEFA Champions League football. As part of our renewed partnership with UEFA, we\u2019ll also be launching new EA SPORTS competitions and we\u2019ll have even more news in this space in the months ahead. We\u2019re bringing new types of experiences to market that will expand the genre. In partnership with KLab, we are developing a groundbreaking new mobile experience inspired by the Japanese market, which we believe will have global appeal. We\u2019re thrilled to announce today that EA SPORTS is returning to college football. So many fans have been asking us to please bring back college football video games. Their passion for this top-selling sports franchise has never wavered. We love college football as well and today, we\u2019re very excited to say, yes, we are coming back. We have started work on an all-new next-gen experience, working closely with our exclusive licensing partners at CLC to include the universities, logos, venues and gameday traditions that fans know and love in college football. We will grow the EA SPORTS portfolio to include experiences in more sports for more fans around the world. In the weeks and months ahead, we\u2019ll make more announcements about our expansion in a different sport, including at least one new experience that will launch next fiscal year. We\u2019re also incredibly excited to build a racing powerhouse with our proposed acquisition of Codemasters. These are amazing teams that we know very well and we are adding significantly to our racing portfolio to drive growth. FORMULA ONE is one of the few truly global sports and is already seeing unprecedented growth in worldwide fandom, including in North America and Asia. We believe the combination of EA SPORTS and Codemasters can take the game franchise to an even greater level. We are awaiting the results of Codemasters shareholder vote on our offer, which we anticipate having tomorrow, February 3. With the strength of our EA SPORTS franchises and these announcements today, we are in a position to deliver the world\u2019s best sports games and content. We intend to leverage our capabilities in this space to grow to more sports and more experiences, reaching larger audiences in more markets all over the world. These announcements today are just the beginning. For 230 million EA SPORTS players and viewers, we are providing a social network that enables them to experience more of the sport they love with their friends. We believe we can grow to 500 million players and viewers in EA SPORTS experiences over the next five years. The future of entertainment is interactive and the future of sports will continue to blur the lines between live sports and immersive and engaging new experiences. EA SPORTS is at the center of this convergence. And in collaboration with our amazing league partners, we are prepared to accelerate the future of sports entertainment. In addition to EA SPORTS, we are driving growth through our portfolio of more than 20 top live services. I\u2019ll give two examples from our deep roster of wholly owned IP. We are at the two-year anniversary of the launch of Apex Legends. And with 30% growth in new players year-over-year, its success is accelerating. The unique seasons of live service content delivered by our talented Respawn team are expanding the Apex audience, bringing in more players with great storytelling and engaging in-game events. Competitive play in Apex Legends is also reaching and entertaining more viewers with recent events in November driving new viewership and watch time records. This is an outstanding live service business that continues to grow across multiple dimensions. Launching the game on Steam is bringing new PC players. We will launch on the Nintendo Switch on March 9 and we\u2019ll expand further with our Apex mobile game rolling out in FY \u201822. The Sims 4 has grown every year since launch. As we expand the experience, more new and relevant content, we engage a diverse and growing audience spanning players of all ages and demographics. Life to date, more than 33 million people have now played The Sims 4. And daily, weekly and monthly average players in the game all reached all-time highs for the third quarter in December. Our Maxis just delivered a tenth expansion pack for The Sims 4 and we see continued growth for our Sims business in FY \u201822. We have the ability to bring games to every platform and we are driving continuing expansion of our total addressable market. Mobile continues to be a key opportunity for us. Games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes continue to be deeply engaging for players and very successful businesses and we have plans to aggressively grow our mobile portfolio. We\u2019re also expanding our lead in subscriptions. The groundbreaking integration of our EA PLAY service with Microsoft Game Pass has accelerated our subscription business, with nearly 13 million players now active in our service across four platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, Steam and our EA client. With more players valuing the subscription model and with our scale across platforms and content, we are building a strong growing business with recurrent revenue. We also have new streaming players joining our network through Xbox cloud gaming, with Game Pass Ultimate and other partners. And we are committed to advancing cloud as a meaningful part of the future of the gaming ecosystem. FY \u201821 has been a year of outstanding growth while working through the challenges of the ongoing pandemic. Our execution continues to be strong even with our employees working from home and we expect that most will continue to do so through September. The creativity and innovation of our talented teams is enabling us to deliver more great experiences in our leading franchises and live services. We have a deep and robust pipeline of new content with more than 35 new games in various levels of incubation and development for the future. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing a lot more about our FY \u201822 plans in the months ahead, including our next Battlefield experience, which will mark a return to all-out military warfare. The game takes full advantage of the power of next-generation platforms to bring massive immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next edition of Battlefield takes all the destruction, player agency, vehicle and weapon combat that the franchise is known for and elevate it to another level. The team is focused and the game is ahead of our internal milestones. We will reveal the game in the spring and deliver defined Battlefield experience for our players in the 2021 holiday season. Games helped fill a great need in people\u2019s lives through 2020. Our franchise is aware so many around the world are coming for connection, entertainment and inspiration. We\u2019re looking forward to delivering more great experiences for hundreds of millions of people engaging with us and driving continued growth in our business through Q4 and into FY \u201822. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of $2.4 billion. We\u2019ve built our live services for longevity. FIFA and Madden have both been around for decades. Measured over the last 10 fiscal years, the FIFA franchise has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of nearly 50% and Madden at nearly 60%. The Sims 4 is on track for its sixth consecutive year of growth and Apex Legends for its second at the beginning of what we hope will be a similar long run for this title. I\u2019d reiterate and amplify here that we expect Apex to deliver well over $500 million in net bookings this year compared to our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. The Apex team has really embraced the playfulness of the characters and gameplay. The team has focused on having more fun in the craft of building and experimenting with new modes and ways to explore the APEX universe and characters. This has been paying off with a compound average growth rate of 14% per season as measured from season 2. That\u2019s equivalent to an annual -- compounded annual growth rate of about 65%. With regards to the sports opportunity, in particular, we estimate the worldwide sports video game software segment is about $7 billion on console and PC today. It\u2019s grown by about 13% annually since 2016. We\u2019re the leader in that segment and are now applying our full focus to the spectrum of sports opportunities from casual to core. The global gaming market for sports is presently about $4.3 billion in size and growing fast at about 24% a year. We\u2019re barely scratching the surface of this massive opportunity. But we have a lot of projects in flight and you\u2019ll hear more about our activities here in the year to come. Operationally, we\u2019re in working in challenging times, but we\u2019ve been able to lean into the advantages that come with our scale to deliver games of quality with remarkably little impact on timing. This quarter, we launched FIFA 21, NHL 21, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond. We also extended FIFA and Madden to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to Stadia and added our EA PLAY services to Microsoft Game Pass. We continued a packed schedule of live events for Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden and NHL. We launched Season 7 for Apex and launched Season 8 today. We launched the Snowy Escapes package for The Sims. The step function jump in digital sales prompted by COVID appeared resilient with digital representing 62% of units sold through in the quarter, up 13 percentage points from last year. Mobile showed its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth with outperformance across the board this quarter, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. We\u2019ll have much more to say about our mobile strategy later this year and we continue to be excited about the games we currently have in play. Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, primarily driven by the phasing of marketing investments. We hit a new record in trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $2.06 billion. The quarter was very close to our record for quarterly cash flow, which we delivered back in Q3 fiscal 2017 with the help of Battlefield 1. Needless to say, we\u2019re excited about the potential for the next Battlefield in Q3 next fiscal year. Our expectations for full-year GAAP revenue was $5.6 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.447 billion and earnings per share of $2.54. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our recently announced 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. We\u2019re raising our net bookings expectations for the year to be $6.075 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance. This is driven by continued strength in our live services, particularly FIFA and Apex Legends. It is $525 million above our expectations at the start of the year despite the changes we made to the product slate during the year. We expect this year to be 13% over prior year, even with a lighter release slate versus the prior year and an FX headwind of about $55 million. For the fourth quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.317 billion, cost of revenue to be $302 million and operating expenses of $837 million. This results in a loss per share of $0.07 for the fourth quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the fourth quarter to be $1.375 billion, which is an increase of $75 million over our prior guidance. We\u2019ve built a foundation for growth in fiscal 2022. We have successfully brought new people into our ecosystem. We\u2019re providing great content for people who want to spend more time there. We\u2019ve been working hard on new titles and new platforms. We expect this to deliver significant organic growth in fiscal 2022. Formal guidance will follow in our Q4 call, but I can tell you now that the Battlefield team is doing an incredible job. They\u2019re way ahead of where they were in product -- prior product cycles, on track for their earliest feature complete in franchise history. Meanwhile, the live service teams for FIFA, Apex Legends, The Sims and Madden all continue to outdo themselves. And of course, we\u2019ll have other surprises that we\u2019ll reveal when the time is right. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. Strong execution throughout FY \u201821 has brought us to this point and the drivers of future growth are foundational to our business. Our teams are creating amazing high-quality games and content for more players around the world than ever before. Our live services that extend and enhance these experiences are keeping players engaged over the long term. And we are transforming our business for continued expansion, growing our portfolio and enabling ways for players to connect with each other and engage deeply with their favorite content. We\u2019re looking forward to a strong Q4 and a year of continued growth in FY \u201822. Now Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. It\u2019s Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. So you guys put out a statement last month that you have multiple Star Wars games still in development. I\u2019m just curious if you can give us an update on those franchises and what we should expect from 2023 forward. And then just the second one is at the point that you guys kind of came into the beginning of fiscal Q3, it was on the tail end of the summer. It felt like parts of the country had partially reopened before locking down again. So I just wonder what the experience you saw over the course of Q3 was in terms of had people churned out at the beginning, then came back into gaming as other entertainment options became more restricted. Or what did you see in user behavior over the course of the last quarter? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So let me jump into that in the context of Star Wars. We won\u2019t be announcing new things here. But what I would say is if you look at our history with Star Wars, we\u2019ve had a long and very profitable relationship, first, with Lucasart and then with -- or Lucasfilm and then with Lucasfilm as part of Disney. We have generated a number of great franchises, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront, Jedi: Fallen Order and most recently, Squadrons. That represents over $3 billion life-to-date net bookings and 52 million games sold. And Galaxy of Heroes is a $1 billion franchise. As we\u2019ve established the very strong part of that franchise, you should expect that we will continue to invest in those as well as some new experiences across platforms for the future. With respect to engagement more broadly, I think that we\u2019ve seen strong engagement throughout the last year. Blake and I have both been relatively conservative, I think, as we look to the future at each moment in time, but we feel good about where engagement has been. And we feel -- we now feel more confident that the increased engagement we\u2019ve seen in our experiences is likely to continue on a go-forward basis. Blake, I don\u2019t know if you have any more to add to that.\nBlake Jorgensen: No. I would say clearly, looking at Q3 in terms of live services and 24% growth year-over-year of live services should prove only one simple thing, which is engagement is stronger than we have ever seen. It is spectacular. And it\u2019s because we\u2019re fulfilling the social connection between people who love the same things, be it some sport, The Sims, Apex. Whatever it is, we figured out how to make that happen. And you don\u2019t see growth on $1.5 billion of revenue without knowing that that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the engagement and the social networks of what we\u2019ve created. And that\u2019s the secret sauce of what we\u2019ve done.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, just on Battlefield. With first-person shooters using free-to-play game mode to expand the top funnel, could you talk a little bit about your ambition to do something like that with Battlefield? Is there anything you could share with us about the content road map? And then my second question is just on the NCAA deal. For those of us who weren\u2019t around when you guys were doing -- I think Football 14 was the last one. Could you just give us some parameters in terms of what the units for -- unit demand for that game was like? Is that a good way to think about some of the future NCAA games that you\u2019ll do going forward? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: On Battlefield, we don\u2019t have anything more to share with you at this point other than we believe that it\u2019s going to usher in a new generation for Battlefield games and Battlefield fans and we\u2019ll be taking -- benefiting from the full power of next-gen platforms. And you should imagine that we\u2019re looking across all forms of the experience to ensure that this is exactly the game that Battlefield fans want to play and the game that we believe will drive growth in the Battlefield franchise. But more on that to come in the month ahead and we\u2019re excited to share more on that at the appropriate time. With respect to our college football game, again, this was kind of part of my past life leading EA SPORTS. It was a really strong game. It was a fan favorite game. It sold tens of millions of units over its life. And we expect that it will continue to be a really strong fan favorite game. It\u2019s measured by the amount of emails I get in my inbox each week requesting us to bring back this game. I think that we could look to the past as a factor for the future. But I\u2019d also say that I think college football, as a fan, audience has grown dramatically since we launched the last game in 2013. I also think the nature of gameplay has changed dramatically as we think about the future of sports and you heard us speak to the conversion of sports and entertainment more broadly. And so we\u2019re excited to bring that back in the years ahead.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks Andrew. That\u2019s really helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have one on Apex and one on FIFA Mobile. So the first one, Apex, very excited for the Nintendo Switch version coming out in March. So with close to 80 million Switches sold worldwide and the fact that Japan is the game\u2019s No. 2 market, can you help us frame the Switch opportunity to the franchise reaching $1 billion in annual bookings versus growth coming from organic and mobile? And then secondly, on FIFA Mobile, can you expand a bit more on the current strategy in growing that title? I believe you mentioned there are six different FIFA games. Are they going to be similar with each other, just being localized for each region? Or are they completely separate games? And why not just have one title tied to the console, PC version like Madden? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. So I\u2019ll start with Apex and then Andrew may want to jump on, on FIFA. So on Apex, clearly, as you said, Japan is the second-largest market for Apex, which is very exciting for us. And we know that it\u2019s one of the largest markets for the Nintendo Switch. And that\u2019s the reason we decided to put it out on Nintendo Switch. But we also know that Nintendo Switch is a global business, not just a Japanese business. We think the combination of Nintendo Switch, Apex plus mobile Apex will be very powerful. We believe mobile Apex will be in soft launch sometime in the next three to four months and hopefully gets into the marketplace quickly. Obviously, it will take longer to get into the market in China because of some of the regulatory issues. But in the rest of the world, we don\u2019t see those issues happening. But we also want to make sure it is the exact product that we want. I think the team is very dedicated to making sure the product is the perfect product for a global market. But they\u2019ve learned a lot from Japan. They\u2019ve learned a lot from character development and so forth in that market and we think that will continue to help us. And let\u2019s all remember, less than two years ago, no one knew this product existed. Today, it\u2019s over $1 billion. We think there is a huge upside to this product over time and I just encourage people to keep focused on that because we don\u2019t have a mobile product today. We don\u2019t have a Switch product today. There are still other platforms around the world that we might go on. This is an opportunity that will last for a very long time and we\u2019re trying to build it for the long range, not just a one-year blip. So we\u2019re very excited about it. With that, Andrew, I\u2019ll throw it over to you on the FIFA question.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. On FIFA, I think the best way to think about this is soccer is the world\u2019s largest sport by a wide margin. Mobile is the world\u2019s largest gaming platform also, as it turns out, by a wide margin in terms of magnitude of players. What we know about soccer as we travel around the world and what we know about mobile as we look at the growing player base is that soccer means different things to different people in different markets. And certainly, as we look at the magnitude of players that come into the mobile ecosystem, they\u2019re often looking for different types of experiences with respect to subject matter that they love. And so as we look at our FIFA business, building off the strength of our licensing relationships on a global basis, we think there is an opportunity to deliver a number of different experiences across the mobile platform from different geographies and different player cohorts based on what they\u2019re looking for. And we think that represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us.\nMario Lu: Great. Helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRyan Gee: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question and answer. First, on live services. So I think the last quarter was down 7% year-over-year. This quarter was up, I think, 28%. But given the timing shift for some of the sports games, I don\u2019t know that either quarter is really that representative. So I was hoping you could clarify what the right cadence is for Ultimate Team since FIFA and Madden launched and how much live services this quarter may have benefited from subscriptions and Game Pass partnerships with Microsoft is like?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I would say, Ryan -- thanks for the question. I\u2019d say the impact on subscriptions is relatively a rounding error. I would say year-over-year growth of 24% would imply that it\u2019s a pretty strong business. And last year, based on what I\u2019m looking -- the numbers I\u2019m looking at wasn\u2019t down. It was up year-over-year. It\u2019s been up year-over-year every year for I don\u2019t know how many years. So it is extremely strong and it\u2019s strong across almost all of our live services: FIFA, Apex, Madden, Medal of Honor and Sims. And even Hockey had one of the best quarters they\u2019ve seen in years. And so what I would try to remember is the bulk of our business this quarter is still live services. And we\u2019re seeing incredible growth across it year-over-year. And subscription, while there\u2019s nice growth, it\u2019s still very small compared to the overall live services growth across all of the games.\nRyan Gee: Okay. Yes, I was referring to the down last quarter because there was timing of FIFA for live services down year-over-year, but I get your point nonetheless. The other question was really just -- could you kind of give us -- with the new next-gen consoles out there in the market, can you give us maybe your high-level observations on consumer response and how the pace of adoption has been relative to your expectations and whether those that now have the console, the new one, have exhibited any different purchase behavior, time spent, engagement versus the prior gen? That would be great.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. On balance, it\u2019s probably a better question for Microsoft and Sony at this point. I think it\u2019s too early to tell for us. I mean anecdotally, what we know to be true is demand is extraordinarily high for both consoles and that retailers, both digital and physical, are struggling to keep them in stock. What we\u2019ve seen is the games that we\u2019ve been able to build on those platforms are really, really strong. And as I look to the games that we\u2019re going to be able to build on those platforms on a go-forward basis, I\u2019m really excited about the new innovations and creativity and gameplay we\u2019re going to be able to deliver. And inevitably, I think that is going to offer a more engaging and immersive experience for our players that will ultimately see growth both in players overall and the time spent in our games.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nTodd Juenger: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve also got two, one on basketball and one on the broad topic of social. Just if you talk about the expansion of sports and lots of dimensions, noticeably absent was any mention of NBA or basketball. I just wondered if you could comment on your sort of latest thinking on that. And in particular, maybe college basketball might be a particular opportunity white space there. That certainly has a large fan base and wonder if that is a potential way for you guys to get back in the basketball business in a big way. Second question on the broad topic of social. It\u2019s a pretty broad question. I\u2019ll try and make it short. But I think the word social was mentioned in your prepared remarks multiple times. Surely, we all could agree that the convergence of what we call gaming and social is happening in front of our eyes, Fortnite, Roblox. Just wondered how you think about, as you evolve your portfolio of games, what that means for your evolution, where your biggest opportunities are to take advantage of that. To me, clearly, The Sims is an obvious place that comes to mind. Are you proactively doing anything to be more sort of aggressive in pursuing that aspect of gaming? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Two great questions. First off, no announcement on basketball to make today. I would say two things. One, I think we underperformed on basketball over the last number of years and that\u2019s been very disappointing to us. With that said, we continue to have a really good relationship with the NBA and remain committed to basketball long term. And you should imagine that we are thinking through the best ways for us to use the strength of our business, the strength of our technology and the amazing creativity of our teams to deliver really cool, new, innovative experiences for basketball fans. With respect to social, in general, the short answer is yes. Part of what we have recognized now is that our players, particularly over the last year, have been using our games as ways to remain connected with their friends even while they are apart. And you may have heard me say this before, but social interaction is moving from physical to digital more broadly for the Gen Z population. And the consumption of sport and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive for the Gen Z population and we kind of sit at the very intersection of those two secular trends. And so what we\u2019ve started to do is really build around our content to ensure that we are providing more social opportunities for our fans and the Madden, Pro Bowl over the weekend was one such example of how we can take our game at the center of a social ecosystem and build around that for fans, both fans who play our games and fans who interact with plays of our games. When we think about our sports franchises, when we think about Apex, when we think about The Sims, when we think about mobile on a go-forward basis, we think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to build more into that and deliver on the social interaction our fans are asking for. And you should expect us to talk more about that in the future as we think about community, commentary, social interaction, competition, all wrapped in the data that our Gen Z fans are using on a day-to-day basis to play our games.\nTodd Juenger: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nMike Hickey: Hey, Andrew, Blake. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just two as well. The first one on your BioWare studio. It looked like you\u2019ve had a few more executives turn over there. I think Casey and Mark left the studio. Can you update us on the executive leadership of BioWare and the product road map from those guys? Would be helpful. And then on Star Wars, obviously, that license is not exclusive. It seems like you\u2019d probably be doing less years. How do you think about sort of realigning your development resources? And broadly speaking, how do you think about licensed IP versus owned IP in the sort of non-sports category? Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Two great questions. First off, on BioWare, again, that is an incredible studio filled with incredible people who do incredible work. And I think that from the outside wall, there have been some blips in their delivery over the last couple of years, but that has come as a result of them pushing deeply into innovation and creativity. And we feel very, very confident about their future road map and we\u2019ve talked about games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect in their future. With respect to Casey and Mark leaving, again, both good friends of mine. We have tremendous respect for both of them. But this happens in the natural course of creative organizations from time to time. And we feel very, very good about the ongoing leadership of that studio and the many people who come to work every day to deliver great innovation and creativity. We look forward to sharing more about what\u2019s coming from BioWare in the near future. And you will have just seen our Mass Effect trilogy Legendary Edition announced and that has been extraordinarily well received by BioWare fans. And so we\u2019re encouraged by what that studio will continue to deliver. In terms of Star Wars, I don\u2019t think you should imagine that the fact that some other people will build some Star Wars games is going to change our commitment to that IP or our ability to build the appropriate number of games. And as I said before, we\u2019ve had a long partnership with Disney, both before our exclusive period that gave us a great opportunity to really establish some very strong franchises like Battlefront, like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, like Jedi: Fallen Order, like Squadrons. You should expect us to continue to invest in our Star Wars relationship. It\u2019s been very profitable, to this point, over $3 billion in net bookings and we\u2019re excited by what we\u2019ll be able to do in the future. But you shouldn\u2019t read this as necessarily us building the less titles. I think what you should take from us more broadly as a company is that we believe in our ability to execute and deliver great, high-quality, deeply engaging content for our fans across both our sports business, our wholly owned IP business and our licensed partnership business like the one we have with Star Wars. And we feel confident and comfortable that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver great games for the future.\nMike Hickey: Thanks guys. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDrew Crum: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. A question on Codemasters as it relates to your commentary on sports and the accompanying growth rates by platform. How has racing as a genre performed? And how quickly would you intend to ramp live services on the Codemasters titles? My second question for Sims to your guidance. So last year, with fiscal 3Q earnings, you suggested that fiscal \u201822 growth would accelerate with the next-gen consoles and Battlefield serving as the key drivers. Maybe fast forward to today, your comp will presumably be much higher than where you thought it would be. But you still have those two pieces in place, plus you\u2019re adding Codemasters and you\u2019ve talked about a number of initiatives with FIFA and Apex today. So given that, is accelerating growth in fiscal \u201822 remotely possible? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. Let me -- Drew, let me start with the second question. We wouldn\u2019t come out and say that accelerating growth was possible, but we\u2019re confident of it -- if we weren\u2019t confident of it. I mean what we\u2019re saying is we believe that the trends that we see in this year\u2019s business will continue. We have Battlefield next year and we haven\u2019t actually even put in place what we think Codex -- or Codemasters could deliver because the deal is not closed yet. And so we\u2019re clearly thinking and saying we see -- coming off of the year in which we started at $5.55 billion, we\u2019re now telling people we\u2019re close to $6.1 billion in revenue. And we\u2019re telling people we\u2019re going to grow again next year. I think you guys should take that as an incredible level of commitment and confidence on where the business is going, absent even additions from nonorganic growth because we spilled out, this is organic growth we\u2019re talking about. And so I would get people -- I\u2019d be very focused on that. There is a lot of spin right now in the marketplace around the fact that we decided to capitalize part of the GILTI tax regimes, R&D expenses in our fourth quarter to try to get behind it because we had a strong year. And so the reason we have a fourth quarter that shows a GAAP -- not a non-GAAP, but a GAAP decline in an EPS is purely getting ahead of what is going to be a tax cost for every company out there that gets hit by GILTI. And we\u2019re trying to be aggressive and stay in front of that. But the cash impact of that is minimal. And we think in a year in which we are already well above our EPS and our earnings, it was the exact right thing to do. And I\u2019m not sure why everyone wants to spin on that, but I would dig in a little bit, ask the questions and make sure you understand what that really means. I know that\u2019s not the question you asked. But I want to make sure it\u2019s clear to everybody that that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on right now. Now Codex on its own could be a nice addition to the company. We know that they have some incredible franchises. The F1 franchise is so nascent. It\u2019s a new franchise for them. We know if you\u2019re based in the U.S., there\u2019s very little F1 racing going on in the U.S. And yet we know that the owners of F1 would like to build an F1 business in the U.S. We know that there\u2019s still expansion around the globe. It is probably one of the best growth opportunities there is and the reason that we\u2019re willing to pay what we were willing to pay for it, on top of the fact that the DiRT franchise, the GRID franchise, all of their franchises are incredible games, but none of them have actually taken advantage of a large publishing organization and a marketing muscle that we\u2019re able to deliver. And we think that has growth to it, not to mention the talent that\u2019s in that organization that could continue to help our Need for Speed business or our Real Racing business. It could be very powerful. So we know it is not a FIFA-sized business, but we know there is incredible opportunity to own essentially all of the driving business there is. So with that passionate answer, I\u2019ve forgotten what your other question was. So...\nDrew Crum: Yes, how racing is performed in the category?\nBlake Jorgensen: Well, you know what, we know that every year, we put out a Need for Speed, it does extremely well. It\u2019s one of those kind of games that if mom goes into the store or goes online and doesn\u2019t want her son or daughter to be playing something that might look a little too competitive or might be too sports-oriented, driving has always been an incredible opportunity in the marketplace. And we know it\u2019s not going to be the size of FIFA, but we believe that there is a huge potential, particularly as you think about the growth of the underlying franchises that we might be able to help drive. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about it.\nDrew Crum: Thanks Blake.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey. Good afternoon, Andrew and Blake. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I could. One, just touching back on Codemasters again and then just one on some of the FIFA mobile and online initiatives. On Codemasters, can you talk maybe just conceptually about what cadence could look like in that genre? Because obviously, you already have Need for Speed in the docket for next year. But is that a genre where you could conceivably see a track title plus a rally title plus a street title every year? Or does that get too crowded? I\u2019m just kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about cadence maybe just conceptually because I know that the deal is not closed yet. And then just secondly and I apologize if you hit on this. The initiatives around FIFA Mobile, the six games in development as well as the PC online for expansion to more markets, any time line color you could provide and kind of when that commences, when it starts, when we start to see developments and how fast that kind of happens? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So let me -- on Codemasters, it\u2019s still early -- too early for us to kind of be able to outline all of that. Again, the deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. But as I think about this as an opportunity, I start with the fact that we will be able to bring together all of the greatest racing talent in our industry or most of the great racing talent in our industry. When I think about taking that collection of talent and pointing them at Need for Speed, pointing them at FORMULA ONE, pointing them at GRID, pointing them at DiRT and thinking about how all of that might happen with regular launches of those titles with really strong live services wrapped around them which we don\u2019t yet see in the Codemasters games, all powered by the leverage of the marketing organization that we have behind us, I think the opportunity is really, really strong. And so you should imagine that as we think about this, Need for Speed, which is already one of the leading racing franchises that we launch every other year, we think there might be opportunities around growth of releases and certainly growth of that title. We think that F1 plus live service plus our marketing muscle is a profound opportunity. And we think that GRID and DiRT also represent great new additions to our portfolio. But the big win here is bringing together what we believe is going to be the greatest collection of racing talent in the industry. With respect to FIFA, all of these things are in play. You will have seen and we talked about this, even our existing FIFA Mobile game has grown year-over-year. Our FIFA Mobile Asia game continues to expand and has grown year-over-year. We are working with KLab in Japan on a Japanese-inspired game, folks on the Japanese market that we believe will have global appeal. But Jeff Karp has come into our mobile organization. We\u2019ve consolidated that organization. We brought all of sports and all other mobile titles together and we have identified sport and particularly soccer as a really, really big global opportunity. As a background, Jeff at one time ran marketing for EA SPORTS many, many years ago. On leaving EA, he ran a number of mobile companies and has come back and is having a tremendous impact on that business. And so no more announcements specifically today, but you should expect over the next year or two that we\u2019re going to roll out growth in this business.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAndrew Marok: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. With the news on FIFA today, I guess if we could just get some of your updated thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about the market opportunity for FIFA and Madden and Stadia. And to the extent that it\u2019s relevant, are there any learnings to take away from Jedi on the platform so far that could be brought to sports? And then second, as Apex expands, it really just has the one core game mode right now. And as you\u2019re looking into options like Switch and mobile, could that potentially expand? And in that case, would that put increased overlap with Battlefield on the table? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: On FIFA, Madden and Stadia, again, this is early. We believe that cloud is going to have a tremendously positive impact on total addressable market in our industry over the long term. And we also think that cloud is going to offer all kinds of new innovation and creativity about the types of games we can build where we can harness the power of cloud compute, compute at the edge and 5G networks that drive latency-free gameplay in between those two end points. And so when we think about Stadia right now, it\u2019s really about working with our cloud partners to innovate and lead in what we believe is going to be a meaningful future for our industry over time. With respect to Apex, no announcements here. I would just come back to Respawn are amazingly creative as a studio. They\u2019ve built unbelievable games both in the content of Titanfall Apex and more recently, Jedi: Fallen Order. As we continue to expand that -- they\u2019re on their eighth -- they\u2019ve just launched their eighth season. Every season adds new characters and new gameplay and at some point, new maps. You should imagine that, that team is thinking about how to further expand that universe over time and we\u2019ll be excited to share more about that in the future.\nAndrew Marok: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Parker with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nTyler Parker: Hey thanks guys. I just wanted one more question on college football. Without student athlete images and likeness this time, it\u2019s going to look a bit different than historically. So I\u2019m curious what we know historically about gamers\u2019 motivations. Are they going in there to play their favorite players or play their favorite teams? How is that going to look? And how do you expect them to react to a game that doesn\u2019t have necessarily student athlete names and likeness in there? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: You might remember that our last game also didn\u2019t have student name and likeness. The game has always been built on the power of the relationship that fans have with their colleges. We\u2019ll have over 100 colleges, all of the logos and kits and stadiums and on-field pageantry that makes college football great. And we are very excited and believe that we can build a really compelling college football game with all of those components in partnership with schools across the country. And the response that we\u2019ve had to the announcement kind of ratifies that excitement. So you should hear more from us on that in the months ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nEric Handler: Hi, thanks for the question. I actually got two questions. First, Blake, I think you did touch on a GAAP basis, but your fourth quarter non-GAAP guidance for operating expenses is like 719 -- $718 million, $719 million, which is a huge step-up from last year\u2019s third quarter and a step-up from the normally big third quarter. So what\u2019s really driving that increase? And should that carry over into next year as well? And then I have a follow-up question for Andrew.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. So think about it, Eric, as a couple of things. One is we\u2019ve continued to try to do everything possible to support our workforce in a work-from-home mode and COVID support. And so you can assume that some portion of those expenses are associated with that and maybe expenses that would drift into next year. Second is we are having -- obviously, we\u2019re having one of the best years we\u2019ve ever had. And what does that mean for us? It means we want to take advantage of the strength in our organization and the ability to hire people, particularly when other companies are not able to do that. And we think this is a unique opportunity for us to go out and continue to try to grow great teams. I mean to give you a simple example. It\u2019s not like we have a group of people just sitting around doing nothing that are waiting to build college football. We\u2019re going to need to grow a team to do that. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do. I think manage the economics of our teams well. But we\u2019re going to continue to hire people particularly in a time in which we\u2019ve been able to prove to our employees and those people who see our employees that we are a great place to work. And so that\u2019s driving some of the uptick in expenses that you\u2019re seeing. And then I would just go back in history and look at, okay, how good were we at always forecasting OpEx? Are we that good at it? Probably not. So with that I\u2019ll turn it to Andrew for your second question.\nEric Handler: Thanks, Blake. Andrew, one big picture question here. When you look at the success Roblox has seen this year and obviously Minecraft has been a huge hit, do you think any of your content could translate well to sort of a user-generated platform?\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. And the short answer is yes. And again Sims has been a user-generated platform since its inception. And we\u2019ve seen creation and sharing on that platform, maybe not to the extent of a Minecraft or a Roblox certainly but as we look at the Maxis team that\u2019s certainly something that is front and center to how they think about that franchise. We\u2019re also thinking about this in the context of some of our new experiences and we have an entire group inside the company right now focused on player agency and creation at a player level. And as we roll out those experience over time you should expect that some of those will be kind of bound to a gain in the way that Minecraft is that -- Sims and Maxis would be a great example of that. And some of those will be platform level. Again, we have some great game development tools and we think over time, there might be an opportunity to share those with our communities and allow them to create new content with those tools over time. It\u2019s certainly a developing area of our industry. It\u2019s something that Gen Z players are really gravitating towards. And when we think about developing a social network for Gen Z plays around each of our major franchises, we think about user-generated content as a very central strand of the DNA of those experiences in those communities.\nEric Handler: Okay. Thank you very much. So I think \u2013\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We delivered net bookings well above our expectations this quarter. The beat was driven by our live services, led by outperformance in Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. We delivered GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion and record net bookings of $2.4 billion. We've built our live services for longevity. FIFA and Madden have both been around for decades. Measured over the last 10 fiscal years, the FIFA franchise has grown at a cumulative annual growth rate of nearly 50% and Madden at nearly 60%. The Sims 4 is on track for its sixth consecutive year of growth and Apex Legends for its second at the beginning of what we hope will be a similar long run for this title. I'd reiterate and amplify here that we expect Apex to deliver well over $500 million in net bookings this year compared to our original expectations of $300 million to $400 million. The Apex team has really embraced the playfulness of the characters and gameplay. The team has focused on having more fun in the craft of building and experimenting with new modes and ways to explore the APEX universe and characters. This has been paying off with a compound average growth rate of 14% per season as measured from season 2. That's equivalent to an annual -- compounded annual growth rate of about 65%. With regards to the sports opportunity, in particular, we estimate the worldwide sports video game software segment is about $7 billion on console and PC today. It's grown by about 13% annually since 2016. We're the leader in that segment and are now applying our full focus to the spectrum of sports opportunities from casual to core. The global gaming market for sports is presently about $4.3 billion in size and growing fast at about 24% a year. We're barely scratching the surface of this massive opportunity. But we have a lot of projects in flight and you'll hear more about our activities here in the year to come. Operationally, we're in working in challenging times, but we've been able to lean into the advantages that come with our scale to deliver games of quality with remarkably little impact on timing. This quarter, we launched FIFA 21, NHL 21, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond. We also extended FIFA and Madden to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order to Stadia and added our EA PLAY services to Microsoft Game Pass. We continued a packed schedule of live events for Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden and NHL. We launched Season 7 for Apex and launched Season 8 today. We launched the Snowy Escapes package for The Sims. The step function jump in digital sales prompted by COVID appeared resilient with digital representing 62% of units sold through in the quarter, up 13 percentage points from last year. Mobile showed its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth with outperformance across the board this quarter, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile. We'll have much more to say about our mobile strategy later this year and we continue to be excited about the games we currently have in play. Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations, primarily driven by the phasing of marketing investments. We hit a new record in trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $2.06 billion. The quarter was very close to our record for quarterly cash flow, which we delivered back in Q3 fiscal 2017 with the help of Battlefield 1. Needless to say, we're excited about the potential for the next Battlefield in Q3 next fiscal year. Our expectations for full-year GAAP revenue was $5.6 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.447 billion and earnings per share of $2.54. Remember that our guidance EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our recently announced 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. We're raising our net bookings expectations for the year to be $6.075 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance. This is driven by continued strength in our live services, particularly FIFA and Apex Legends. It is $525 million above our expectations at the start of the year despite the changes we made to the product slate during the year. We expect this year to be 13% over prior year, even with a lighter release slate versus the prior year and an FX headwind of about $55 million. For the fourth quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.317 billion, cost of revenue to be $302 million and operating expenses of $837 million. This results in a loss per share of $0.07 for the fourth quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the fourth quarter to be $1.375 billion, which is an increase of $75 million over our prior guidance. We've built a foundation for growth in fiscal 2022. We have successfully brought new people into our ecosystem. We're providing great content for people who want to spend more time there. We've been working hard on new titles and new platforms. We expect this to deliver significant organic growth in fiscal 2022. Formal guidance will follow in our Q4 call, but I can tell you now that the Battlefield team is doing an incredible job. They're way ahead of where they were in product -- prior product cycles, on track for their earliest feature complete in franchise history. Meanwhile, the live service teams for FIFA, Apex Legends, The Sims and Madden all continue to outdo themselves. And of course, we'll have other surprises that we'll reveal when the time is right. Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew. No. I would say clearly, looking at Q3 in terms of live services and 24% growth year-over-year of live services should prove only one simple thing, which is engagement is stronger than we have ever seen. It is spectacular. And it's because we're fulfilling the social connection between people who love the same things, be it some sport, The Sims, Apex. Whatever it is, we figured out how to make that happen. And you don't see growth on $1.5 billion of revenue without knowing that that's what's driving the engagement and the social networks of what we've created. And that's the secret sauce of what we've done. Yes. So I'll start with Apex and then Andrew may want to jump on, on FIFA. So on Apex, clearly, as you said, Japan is the second-largest market for Apex, which is very exciting for us. And we know that it's one of the largest markets for the Nintendo Switch. And that's the reason we decided to put it out on Nintendo Switch. But we also know that Nintendo Switch is a global business, not just a Japanese business. We think the combination of Nintendo Switch, Apex plus mobile Apex will be very powerful. We believe mobile Apex will be in soft launch sometime in the next three to four months and hopefully gets into the marketplace quickly. Obviously, it will take longer to get into the market in China because of some of the regulatory issues. But in the rest of the world, we don't see those issues happening. But we also want to make sure it is the exact product that we want. I think the team is very dedicated to making sure the product is the perfect product for a global market. But they've learned a lot from Japan. They've learned a lot from character development and so forth in that market and we think that will continue to help us. And let's all remember, less than two years ago, no one knew this product existed. Today, it's over $1 billion. We think there is a huge upside to this product over time and I just encourage people to keep focused on that because we don't have a mobile product today. We don't have a Switch product today. There are still other platforms around the world that we might go on. This is an opportunity that will last for a very long time and we're trying to build it for the long range, not just a one-year blip. So we're very excited about it. With that, Andrew, I'll throw it over to you on the FIFA question. Yes. I would say, Ryan -- thanks for the question. I'd say the impact on subscriptions is relatively a rounding error. I would say year-over-year growth of 24% would imply that it's a pretty strong business. And last year, based on what I'm looking -- the numbers I'm looking at wasn't down. It was up year-over-year. It's been up year-over-year every year for I don't know how many years. So it is extremely strong and it's strong across almost all of our live services: FIFA, Apex, Madden, Medal of Honor and Sims. And even Hockey had one of the best quarters they've seen in years. And so what I would try to remember is the bulk of our business this quarter is still live services. And we're seeing incredible growth across it year-over-year. And subscription, while there's nice growth, it's still very small compared to the overall live services growth across all of the games. Yes. Let me -- Drew, let me start with the second question. We wouldn't come out and say that accelerating growth was possible, but we're confident of it -- if we weren't confident of it. I mean what we're saying is we believe that the trends that we see in this year's business will continue. We have Battlefield next year and we haven't actually even put in place what we think Codex -- or Codemasters could deliver because the deal is not closed yet. And so we're clearly thinking and saying we see -- coming off of the year in which we started at $5.55 billion, we're now telling people we're close to $6.1 billion in revenue. And we're telling people we're going to grow again next year. I think you guys should take that as an incredible level of commitment and confidence on where the business is going, absent even additions from nonorganic growth because we spilled out, this is organic growth we're talking about. And so I would get people -- I'd be very focused on that. There is a lot of spin right now in the marketplace around the fact that we decided to capitalize part of the GILTI tax regimes, R&D expenses in our fourth quarter to try to get behind it because we had a strong year. And so the reason we have a fourth quarter that shows a GAAP -- not a non-GAAP, but a GAAP decline in an EPS is purely getting ahead of what is going to be a tax cost for every company out there that gets hit by GILTI. And we're trying to be aggressive and stay in front of that. But the cash impact of that is minimal. And we think in a year in which we are already well above our EPS and our earnings, it was the exact right thing to do. And I'm not sure why everyone wants to spin on that, but I would dig in a little bit, ask the questions and make sure you understand what that really means. I know that's not the question you asked. But I want to make sure it's clear to everybody that that's exactly what's going on right now. Now Codex on its own could be a nice addition to the company. We know that they have some incredible franchises. The F1 franchise is so nascent. It's a new franchise for them. We know if you're based in the U.S., there's very little F1 racing going on in the U.S. And yet we know that the owners of F1 would like to build an F1 business in the U.S. We know that there's still expansion around the globe. It is probably one of the best growth opportunities there is and the reason that we're willing to pay what we were willing to pay for it, on top of the fact that the DiRT franchise, the GRID franchise, all of their franchises are incredible games, but none of them have actually taken advantage of a large publishing organization and a marketing muscle that we're able to deliver. And we think that has growth to it, not to mention the talent that's in that organization that could continue to help our Need for Speed business or our Real Racing business. It could be very powerful. So we know it is not a FIFA-sized business, but we know there is incredible opportunity to own essentially all of the driving business there is. So with that passionate answer, I've forgotten what your other question was. So... Well, you know what, we know that every year, we put out a Need for Speed, it does extremely well. It's one of those kind of games that if mom goes into the store or goes online and doesn't want her son or daughter to be playing something that might look a little too competitive or might be too sports-oriented, driving has always been an incredible opportunity in the marketplace. And we know it's not going to be the size of FIFA, but we believe that there is a huge potential, particularly as you think about the growth of the underlying franchises that we might be able to help drive. And that's why we're so excited about it. Yes. So think about it, Eric, as a couple of things. One is we've continued to try to do everything possible to support our workforce in a work-from-home mode and COVID support. And so you can assume that some portion of those expenses are associated with that and maybe expenses that would drift into next year. Second is we are having -- obviously, we're having one of the best years we've ever had. And what does that mean for us? It means we want to take advantage of the strength in our organization and the ability to hire people, particularly when other companies are not able to do that. And we think this is a unique opportunity for us to go out and continue to try to grow great teams. I mean to give you a simple example. It's not like we have a group of people just sitting around doing nothing that are waiting to build college football. We're going to need to grow a team to do that. We think it's the right thing to do. I think manage the economics of our teams well. But we're going to continue to hire people particularly in a time in which we've been able to prove to our employees and those people who see our employees that we are a great place to work. And so that's driving some of the uptick in expenses that you're seeing. And then I would just go back in history and look at, okay, how good were we at always forecasting OpEx? Are we that good at it? Probably not. So with that I'll turn it to Andrew for your second question."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I hope this finds all of you well and staying healthy amid the ongoing pandemic. This continues to be a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. We've delivered net bookings and earnings above our guidance each quarter and we are raising guidance today for the remainder of FY \u201821. After starting this fiscal year with guidance for $5.55 billion in net bookings, we're now expecting to achieve nearly $6.1 billion in net bookings for the full year. And we are projecting growth in our business to continue next fiscal year. We're delivering exceptional high-quality experiences across the unmatched breadth and depth of our portfolio. We are driving growth through our live services and we are reaching new players by bringing our content and subscription to more platforms. Drilling down on these growth drivers. EA SPORTS is at the core of the sports experience for hundreds of millions of fans. More and more people, especially younger Gen Z players, are now defining their sports fandom through the games they play like FIFA, Madden, NHL and UFC. In the past fiscal year, we've had more than 230 million people engaged with our EA SPORTS franchises and content. We delivered six new high-quality sports games in FY \u201821, including FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21, on the new Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, ushering in a new generation of sports games. FIFA continues to grow on every platform. We set a new record of nearly six million daily active players in FIFA Ultimate Team in December and FUT matches have grown a staggering 177% year-over-year. FIFA Online 4 in Korea has had higher player acquisition in every quarter of this year compared to last year. And we now have nearly 21 million players in FIFA Mobile Asia. We are driving growth across our EA SPORTS portfolio. Madden NFL has more players engaged in the franchise than ever before. NHL engagement is up 13% year-over-year. And since launch, UFC 4 has consistently had 20% more daily players than our previous game. EA SPORTS is at the center of innovation, both in our games as well as how fans are connecting through our games to their friends and to the sports they love. For example, in a year where an in-person Pro Bowl event was not possible, we worked with our NFL partners to create the first-ever virtual Pro Bowl in Madden NFL 21. This was a groundbreaking experience for fans, where playing Madden actually helped to select two Pro Bowl players. The Pro Bowl itself then took place in Madden NFL 21 with Deshaun Watson and Kyler Murray leading teams of NFL stars in highly entertaining broadcast that aired on Twitch, the NFL Network and NFL social channels last Sunday. Now the Super Bowl is just a few days away and we're preparing new content in and outside non-NFL for the increasing number of players engaging with our franchise around the NFL's championship game. Events like this year's Pro Bowl demonstrate how real-world sports experiences are evolving to become interactive and you can expect to see us continue to lead here. Our fans are telling us that they want more of what EA SPORTS can deliver. They're playing more of our games than ever before. They're spending more time with our content. And they're connecting with each other, the players and teams and sports they love through our experiences. We are now set to build on our leadership position with an aggressive expansion planned for EA SPORTS. We have important announcements we are making today and more that we expect to make in the weeks ahead that will lead to more great games and content for fans and significant new growth to our company. We have a major global expansion of our soccer business under way. As the scale of our EA SPORTS FIFA player audience expands, including a growing Gen Z population, we will offer more great content on more platforms with our long-standing partners across all the top leagues and teams in the sport. We are bringing FIFA Online to new territories, including Russia, Poland and Turkey, with a combined audience of 80 million players. We are also accelerating our focus on mobile with six new soccer mobile experiences in development today for different regions and genres. EA SPORTS is the premier partner for football organizations, leagues and teams around the world. And today, we are announcing that EA SPORTS FIFA will continue to be the exclusive home of UEFA Champions League football. As part of our renewed partnership with UEFA, we'll also be launching new EA SPORTS competitions and we'll have even more news in this space in the months ahead. We're bringing new types of experiences to market that will expand the genre. In partnership with KLab, we are developing a groundbreaking new mobile experience inspired by the Japanese market, which we believe will have global appeal. We're thrilled to announce today that EA SPORTS is returning to college football. So many fans have been asking us to please bring back college football video games. Their passion for this top-selling sports franchise has never wavered. We love college football as well and today, we're very excited to say, yes, we are coming back. We have started work on an all-new next-gen experience, working closely with our exclusive licensing partners at CLC to include the universities, logos, venues and gameday traditions that fans know and love in college football. We will grow the EA SPORTS portfolio to include experiences in more sports for more fans around the world. In the weeks and months ahead, we'll make more announcements about our expansion in a different sport, including at least one new experience that will launch next fiscal year. We're also incredibly excited to build a racing powerhouse with our proposed acquisition of Codemasters. These are amazing teams that we know very well and we are adding significantly to our racing portfolio to drive growth. FORMULA ONE is one of the few truly global sports and is already seeing unprecedented growth in worldwide fandom, including in North America and Asia. We believe the combination of EA SPORTS and Codemasters can take the game franchise to an even greater level. We are awaiting the results of Codemasters shareholder vote on our offer, which we anticipate having tomorrow, February 3. With the strength of our EA SPORTS franchises and these announcements today, we are in a position to deliver the world's best sports games and content. We intend to leverage our capabilities in this space to grow to more sports and more experiences, reaching larger audiences in more markets all over the world. These announcements today are just the beginning. For 230 million EA SPORTS players and viewers, we are providing a social network that enables them to experience more of the sport they love with their friends. We believe we can grow to 500 million players and viewers in EA SPORTS experiences over the next five years. The future of entertainment is interactive and the future of sports will continue to blur the lines between live sports and immersive and engaging new experiences. EA SPORTS is at the center of this convergence. And in collaboration with our amazing league partners, we are prepared to accelerate the future of sports entertainment. In addition to EA SPORTS, we are driving growth through our portfolio of more than 20 top live services. I'll give two examples from our deep roster of wholly owned IP. We are at the two-year anniversary of the launch of Apex Legends. And with 30% growth in new players year-over-year, its success is accelerating. The unique seasons of live service content delivered by our talented Respawn team are expanding the Apex audience, bringing in more players with great storytelling and engaging in-game events. Competitive play in Apex Legends is also reaching and entertaining more viewers with recent events in November driving new viewership and watch time records. This is an outstanding live service business that continues to grow across multiple dimensions. Launching the game on Steam is bringing new PC players. We will launch on the Nintendo Switch on March 9 and we'll expand further with our Apex mobile game rolling out in FY \u201822. The Sims 4 has grown every year since launch. As we expand the experience, more new and relevant content, we engage a diverse and growing audience spanning players of all ages and demographics. Life to date, more than 33 million people have now played The Sims 4. And daily, weekly and monthly average players in the game all reached all-time highs for the third quarter in December. Our Maxis just delivered a tenth expansion pack for The Sims 4 and we see continued growth for our Sims business in FY \u201822. We have the ability to bring games to every platform and we are driving continuing expansion of our total addressable market. Mobile continues to be a key opportunity for us. Games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes continue to be deeply engaging for players and very successful businesses and we have plans to aggressively grow our mobile portfolio. We're also expanding our lead in subscriptions. The groundbreaking integration of our EA PLAY service with Microsoft Game Pass has accelerated our subscription business, with nearly 13 million players now active in our service across four platforms: Xbox, PlayStation, Steam and our EA client. With more players valuing the subscription model and with our scale across platforms and content, we are building a strong growing business with recurrent revenue. We also have new streaming players joining our network through Xbox cloud gaming, with Game Pass Ultimate and other partners. And we are committed to advancing cloud as a meaningful part of the future of the gaming ecosystem. FY \u201821 has been a year of outstanding growth while working through the challenges of the ongoing pandemic. Our execution continues to be strong even with our employees working from home and we expect that most will continue to do so through September. The creativity and innovation of our talented teams is enabling us to deliver more great experiences in our leading franchises and live services. We have a deep and robust pipeline of new content with more than 35 new games in various levels of incubation and development for the future. We're looking forward to sharing a lot more about our FY \u201822 plans in the months ahead, including our next Battlefield experience, which will mark a return to all-out military warfare. The game takes full advantage of the power of next-generation platforms to bring massive immersive battles to life with more players than ever before. Featuring maps with unprecedented scale, the next edition of Battlefield takes all the destruction, player agency, vehicle and weapon combat that the franchise is known for and elevate it to another level. The team is focused and the game is ahead of our internal milestones. We will reveal the game in the spring and deliver defined Battlefield experience for our players in the 2021 holiday season. Games helped fill a great need in people's lives through 2020. Our franchise is aware so many around the world are coming for connection, entertainment and inspiration. We're looking forward to delivering more great experiences for hundreds of millions of people engaging with us and driving continued growth in our business through Q4 and into FY \u201822. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Thanks, Blake. Strong execution throughout FY \u201821 has brought us to this point and the drivers of future growth are foundational to our business. Our teams are creating amazing high-quality games and content for more players around the world than ever before. Our live services that extend and enhance these experiences are keeping players engaged over the long term. And we are transforming our business for continued expansion, growing our portfolio and enabling ways for players to connect with each other and engage deeply with their favorite content. We're looking forward to a strong Q4 and a year of continued growth in FY \u201822. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Yes. So let me jump into that in the context of Star Wars. We won't be announcing new things here. But what I would say is if you look at our history with Star Wars, we've had a long and very profitable relationship, first, with Lucasart and then with -- or Lucasfilm and then with Lucasfilm as part of Disney. We have generated a number of great franchises, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront, Jedi: Fallen Order and most recently, Squadrons. That represents over $3 billion life-to-date net bookings and 52 million games sold. And Galaxy of Heroes is a $1 billion franchise. As we've established the very strong part of that franchise, you should expect that we will continue to invest in those as well as some new experiences across platforms for the future. With respect to engagement more broadly, I think that we've seen strong engagement throughout the last year. Blake and I have both been relatively conservative, I think, as we look to the future at each moment in time, but we feel good about where engagement has been. And we feel -- we now feel more confident that the increased engagement we've seen in our experiences is likely to continue on a go-forward basis. Blake, I don't know if you have any more to add to that. On Battlefield, we don't have anything more to share with you at this point other than we believe that it's going to usher in a new generation for Battlefield games and Battlefield fans and we'll be taking -- benefiting from the full power of next-gen platforms. And you should imagine that we're looking across all forms of the experience to ensure that this is exactly the game that Battlefield fans want to play and the game that we believe will drive growth in the Battlefield franchise. But more on that to come in the month ahead and we're excited to share more on that at the appropriate time. With respect to our college football game, again, this was kind of part of my past life leading EA SPORTS. It was a really strong game. It was a fan favorite game. It sold tens of millions of units over its life. And we expect that it will continue to be a really strong fan favorite game. It's measured by the amount of emails I get in my inbox each week requesting us to bring back this game. I think that we could look to the past as a factor for the future. But I'd also say that I think college football, as a fan, audience has grown dramatically since we launched the last game in 2013. I also think the nature of gameplay has changed dramatically as we think about the future of sports and you heard us speak to the conversion of sports and entertainment more broadly. And so we're excited to bring that back in the years ahead. Yes. On FIFA, I think the best way to think about this is soccer is the world's largest sport by a wide margin. Mobile is the world's largest gaming platform also, as it turns out, by a wide margin in terms of magnitude of players. What we know about soccer as we travel around the world and what we know about mobile as we look at the growing player base is that soccer means different things to different people in different markets. And certainly, as we look at the magnitude of players that come into the mobile ecosystem, they're often looking for different types of experiences with respect to subject matter that they love. And so as we look at our FIFA business, building off the strength of our licensing relationships on a global basis, we think there is an opportunity to deliver a number of different experiences across the mobile platform from different geographies and different player cohorts based on what they're looking for. And we think that represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us. Yes. On balance, it's probably a better question for Microsoft and Sony at this point. I think it's too early to tell for us. I mean anecdotally, what we know to be true is demand is extraordinarily high for both consoles and that retailers, both digital and physical, are struggling to keep them in stock. What we've seen is the games that we've been able to build on those platforms are really, really strong. And as I look to the games that we're going to be able to build on those platforms on a go-forward basis, I'm really excited about the new innovations and creativity and gameplay we're going to be able to deliver. And inevitably, I think that is going to offer a more engaging and immersive experience for our players that will ultimately see growth both in players overall and the time spent in our games. Two great questions. First off, no announcement on basketball to make today. I would say two things. One, I think we underperformed on basketball over the last number of years and that's been very disappointing to us. With that said, we continue to have a really good relationship with the NBA and remain committed to basketball long term. And you should imagine that we are thinking through the best ways for us to use the strength of our business, the strength of our technology and the amazing creativity of our teams to deliver really cool, new, innovative experiences for basketball fans. With respect to social, in general, the short answer is yes. Part of what we have recognized now is that our players, particularly over the last year, have been using our games as ways to remain connected with their friends even while they are apart. And you may have heard me say this before, but social interaction is moving from physical to digital more broadly for the Gen Z population. And the consumption of sport and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive for the Gen Z population and we kind of sit at the very intersection of those two secular trends. And so what we've started to do is really build around our content to ensure that we are providing more social opportunities for our fans and the Madden, Pro Bowl over the weekend was one such example of how we can take our game at the center of a social ecosystem and build around that for fans, both fans who play our games and fans who interact with plays of our games. When we think about our sports franchises, when we think about Apex, when we think about The Sims, when we think about mobile on a go-forward basis, we think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to build more into that and deliver on the social interaction our fans are asking for. And you should expect us to talk more about that in the future as we think about community, commentary, social interaction, competition, all wrapped in the data that our Gen Z fans are using on a day-to-day basis to play our games. Two great questions. First off, on BioWare, again, that is an incredible studio filled with incredible people who do incredible work. And I think that from the outside wall, there have been some blips in their delivery over the last couple of years, but that has come as a result of them pushing deeply into innovation and creativity. And we feel very, very confident about their future road map and we've talked about games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect in their future. With respect to Casey and Mark leaving, again, both good friends of mine. We have tremendous respect for both of them. But this happens in the natural course of creative organizations from time to time. And we feel very, very good about the ongoing leadership of that studio and the many people who come to work every day to deliver great innovation and creativity. We look forward to sharing more about what's coming from BioWare in the near future. And you will have just seen our Mass Effect trilogy Legendary Edition announced and that has been extraordinarily well received by BioWare fans. And so we're encouraged by what that studio will continue to deliver. In terms of Star Wars, I don't think you should imagine that the fact that some other people will build some Star Wars games is going to change our commitment to that IP or our ability to build the appropriate number of games. And as I said before, we've had a long partnership with Disney, both before our exclusive period that gave us a great opportunity to really establish some very strong franchises like Battlefront, like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, like Jedi: Fallen Order, like Squadrons. You should expect us to continue to invest in our Star Wars relationship. It's been very profitable, to this point, over $3 billion in net bookings and we're excited by what we'll be able to do in the future. But you shouldn't read this as necessarily us building the less titles. I think what you should take from us more broadly as a company is that we believe in our ability to execute and deliver great, high-quality, deeply engaging content for our fans across both our sports business, our wholly owned IP business and our licensed partnership business like the one we have with Star Wars. And we feel confident and comfortable that we're going to be able to deliver great games for the future. Yes. So let me -- on Codemasters, it's still early -- too early for us to kind of be able to outline all of that. Again, the deal hasn't closed yet. But as I think about this as an opportunity, I start with the fact that we will be able to bring together all of the greatest racing talent in our industry or most of the great racing talent in our industry. When I think about taking that collection of talent and pointing them at Need for Speed, pointing them at FORMULA ONE, pointing them at GRID, pointing them at DiRT and thinking about how all of that might happen with regular launches of those titles with really strong live services wrapped around them which we don't yet see in the Codemasters games, all powered by the leverage of the marketing organization that we have behind us, I think the opportunity is really, really strong. And so you should imagine that as we think about this, Need for Speed, which is already one of the leading racing franchises that we launch every other year, we think there might be opportunities around growth of releases and certainly growth of that title. We think that F1 plus live service plus our marketing muscle is a profound opportunity. And we think that GRID and DiRT also represent great new additions to our portfolio. But the big win here is bringing together what we believe is going to be the greatest collection of racing talent in the industry. With respect to FIFA, all of these things are in play. You will have seen and we talked about this, even our existing FIFA Mobile game has grown year-over-year. Our FIFA Mobile Asia game continues to expand and has grown year-over-year. We are working with KLab in Japan on a Japanese-inspired game, folks on the Japanese market that we believe will have global appeal. But Jeff Karp has come into our mobile organization. We've consolidated that organization. We brought all of sports and all other mobile titles together and we have identified sport and particularly soccer as a really, really big global opportunity. As a background, Jeff at one time ran marketing for EA SPORTS many, many years ago. On leaving EA, he ran a number of mobile companies and has come back and is having a tremendous impact on that business. And so no more announcements specifically today, but you should expect over the next year or two that we're going to roll out growth in this business. On FIFA, Madden and Stadia, again, this is early. We believe that cloud is going to have a tremendously positive impact on total addressable market in our industry over the long term. And we also think that cloud is going to offer all kinds of new innovation and creativity about the types of games we can build where we can harness the power of cloud compute, compute at the edge and 5G networks that drive latency-free gameplay in between those two end points. And so when we think about Stadia right now, it's really about working with our cloud partners to innovate and lead in what we believe is going to be a meaningful future for our industry over time. With respect to Apex, no announcements here. I would just come back to Respawn are amazingly creative as a studio. They've built unbelievable games both in the content of Titanfall Apex and more recently, Jedi: Fallen Order. As we continue to expand that -- they're on their eighth -- they've just launched their eighth season. Every season adds new characters and new gameplay and at some point, new maps. You should imagine that, that team is thinking about how to further expand that universe over time and we'll be excited to share more about that in the future. You might remember that our last game also didn't have student name and likeness. The game has always been built on the power of the relationship that fans have with their colleges. We'll have over 100 colleges, all of the logos and kits and stadiums and on-field pageantry that makes college football great. And we are very excited and believe that we can build a really compelling college football game with all of those components in partnership with schools across the country. And the response that we've had to the announcement kind of ratifies that excitement. So you should hear more from us on that in the months ahead. Great question. And the short answer is yes. And again Sims has been a user-generated platform since its inception. And we've seen creation and sharing on that platform, maybe not to the extent of a Minecraft or a Roblox certainly but as we look at the Maxis team that's certainly something that is front and center to how they think about that franchise. We're also thinking about this in the context of some of our new experiences and we have an entire group inside the company right now focused on player agency and creation at a player level. And as we roll out those experience over time you should expect that some of those will be kind of bound to a gain in the way that Minecraft is that -- Sims and Maxis would be a great example of that. And some of those will be platform level. Again, we have some great game development tools and we think over time, there might be an opportunity to share those with our communities and allow them to create new content with those tools over time. It's certainly a developing area of our industry. It's something that Gen Z players are really gravitating towards. And when we think about developing a social network for Gen Z plays around each of our major franchises, we think about user-generated content as a very central strand of the DNA of those experiences in those communities."

I hope this find everyone well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. After the biggest first quarter in the history of Electronic Arts, our second quarter of FY 2021 showed continued strength with net revenue and earnings above our guidance. We are driving growth through the breadth, depth and quality of our new games, our industry-leading live services and expansion to more platforms and more ways to play. Let me first say, how thankful I am to our teams for their incredible work and everything they are delivering for our players. The well-being of our people remains our top priority. Even amidst these unprecedented circumstances, we are executing and building great strength across our business. Here are a few key examples. We delivered eight new games so far this year, and our network has grown to more than 330 million unique accounts as tens of millions of new players have joined to enjoy more of our amazing games and content. EA SPORTS continues to be a leader in sports interactive entertainment. Madden NFL 20 was the most successful game in franchise history last year and now Madden NFL 21 already has nearly 30% more players year-over-year from launch. Our FIFA franchise is engaging more than 100 million players globally. Even prior to launching FIFA 21 our FIFA franchise is having the biggest calendar year ever with our business across all platforms up 26% year-over-year in net bookings. FIFA 20 has reached nearly 35 million players on console and PC. FIFA Mobile continues to perform well and FIFA Online Asia broke engagement records across China and Korea in Q2. We just launched FIFA Mobile in Japan in October, as we continue to see significant international expansion opportunities for our FIFA franchise. We continue to have an outstanding relationship with Disney and Lucasfilms. Star Wars: Squadrons launched a great feedback from critics and the community and has performed above our expectations. This is clearly a special game for fans and continues the extraordinary success we've had bringing great games to life with this IP, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Star Wars Battlefront franchise. Our live services are among the most successful in the industry and our live services net bookings have grown more than 28% fiscal year-over-year to date. EA SPORTS ultimate team has more than 30 million players so far this year, up 25% year-over-year. Around the world our multi-platform Sims community continues to grow and our Sims four player base on PC and console is now the largest in franchise history. Apex Legends has established itself as a top global franchise with major year-over-year growth and continued expansion opportunities. Apex in Asia is having great success with each season of content. We've just launched a game to massive Steam community and cross play is now live making it easier for people to play with friends around the world. Our esports programs are scaling the new records in viewership also. Our new Madden NFL episodic content featuring NFL athletes, celebrities and top Madden NFL players is bringing great entertainment to a much wider audience. And our recent FIFA 21 challenge, which paired esports stars with celebrity soccer players was our most watch esports event to date with viewership that place it amongst top esports broadcast worldwide. Our EA PLAY service is the most successful multi-platform subscription in the industry. With the addition of our subscription on PS4 and Steam, we've reached more than 6.5 million paid subscribers. EA PLAY is now set to go live on Microsoft Game Pass in a few days, and we believe we have the opportunity to double our subscriber base over the next 12 months. In addition to our subscription, we launched more than 125 games and content packs on Steam this year with new tiles like C&C Remastered and Star Wars: Squadrons leading the download chat on the platform. Bringing our games to Steam is a new and additive business for us. With the EA and Steam communities able to play together, we're able to harness the full opportunity in the PC space as it continues to show strong growth. We continue to lead the industry as the only developer and publisher with the ability to bring this much quality content to players. We've done this through unprecedented circumstances in the last six months and now we're delivering more great experiences in our current quarter. We started our third quarter by launching two new EA SPORTS games. When it went live globally on October 9 FIFA 21 already had a record number of players in the game through the early access benefit of our subscription. Our player metrics in FIFA 21 are strong and FIFA Ultimate Team also continues to grow with matches in the mode up 30% year-over-year. NHL 21, which includes the fan favorite NHL 94 Rewind has quickly become the most successful NHL game yet on current gen consoles. The Sims four and Apex Legends show how we build great live services into strong ongoing businesses. This quarter we'll launch our tenth expansion pack for the Sims 4 along with an important game update to add even more cultural customization options for our players. On the heels of our highly successful Season 6 we've just launched Season 7 in Apex Legends which is said to be our biggest season of content this year. We now have more than 20 top live services across console, PC and mobile forming a foundation for continued growth. We will continue to reach more players across more platforms in Q3. We have more titles launching on Switch and Google Stadia this quarter. Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond will launch on Oculus VR in December our second VR experience this year. And as I mentioned before, we will take another step in our subscription strategy this week with our expansion to Microsoft Game Pass opening significant new opportunities to grow our subscriber base. This quarter also brings the launch of next-generation consoles from our partners at Microsoft and Sony. EA SPORTS is always at the center of innovation for us and it will lead the way on next-gen consoles. FIFA 21 for PS5 and Xbox Series X will leverage the major upgrading technology to bring players unprecedented immersion, innovative gameplay and minimal load times to put them into the action in under two seconds. Madden NFL 21 for the next-gen consoles will blur the lines of sport even further through a new system that is responsive to the way NFL players perform in the real world. We're excited to have an opportunity to bring even more players into our FIFA and Madden franchises this year and we're providing a smooth transition for players on current gen consoles to move over with the next-gen upgrade. Looking ahead, I want to offer a few thoughts on our growth drivers for FY 2022 and beyond. Each previous console generation has grown in the global market and we expect this transition will be the same. We plan to launch at least six new games on the next-gen consoles in FY 2022. These will include a new Need for Speed game that is bringing some astounding visual leaps developed by the Criterion team who have launched some of the most highly rated games in franchise history. DICE is creating our next Battlefield game with never before seen scale. The technical advancements of the new consoles are allowing the team to deliver a true next-gen vision for the franchise. We have hands on play testing underway internally and the team has been getting very positive feedback on the game as we've begun to engage our community. The next Battlefield is set to launch in holiday 2021, we're excited to share a lot more about the game in the spring. Our live services are positioned to be a long-term growth driver. Having built Apex Legends into an amazing live service with a deeply engaged community, the talented Respawn team in Los Angeles has expanded Apex development to include a full team in our Vancouver location so that we can continue delivering more great content. Japan is now our second largest market for Apex Legends and we have strong plans to continue growth in that region. In addition, Apex mobile development will be complete in the New Year and ready for launch in FY 2022. We also expect another very strong year for the Sims 4 a testament to the strength of that community as it enters the seventh year of live service. EA SPORTS will be executing on a significant expansion that will span new games more geographies and more ways to engage. FIFA is growing. In addition to FIFA 21 on next-gen this year and Stadia in the new year, the success of our FIFA Online four free-to-play game in Asia now leads us to expand that game to new markets including the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Soccer continues to grow on popularity around the world and we now have six new soccer mobile games in development for new genres and new markets. Our roster of top soccer league licenses is also unmatched. Our recently extended agreements with the Bundesliga and La Liga in addition to more than 30 other league partners including UEFA Champions League, [11:22] [Indiscernible] and the Premier League enable us to continue delivering this franchise to more players around the world with the authenticity they expect. We also just announced a new multiyear -- we also just announced new multiyear agreements with our partners at the NHL, NHLPA and UFC that is creating more innovative hockey and fighting experiences. We also have plans to add our core EA SPORTS portfolio with multiple new franchises in the years ahead. In addition to our college esports expansion that we've just announced with ING Group, in the weeks ahead we'll share more about another major new development in our esports program capitalizing on our growing fan base and demand from esports teams, sponsors and broadcasters. Our business has expanded significantly this year. Our pipeline of new games and live services is robust and we're positioned well for sustained growth. A huge thank you goes to our amazing teams for their incredible spirit and dedication to our players. I am proud of how we have continued to execute. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. \nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew and I will echo what you said earlier which is we hope all of you on the phone are healthy, your families are healthy and you're dealing with this amazing challenge. We continue to be unbelievably impressed by how our teams have actually delivered. And Andrew talked about that and it is just a testament to the strength of Electronic Arts. As you know from Chris' introduction, we're trying something a little different with our earnings call this quarter. And you should listen to my prepared remarks in conjunction with the expanded presentation we've posted on our Investor Relations website earlier today. It contains the metrics and the color I would normally read and bore you with. But hopefully, it gives you a lot more information than maybe you might hear through the call. This approach gives us more time for analysis and more time for your questions. So with that I'd like to briefly highlight a few points. We came in well above our guidance for the quarter. The beat was driven by our live services led by Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA Ultimate Team. First week sell-through for Madden was up nearly 20% year-on-year and this after Madden NFL 20 turning the best year ever for Madden on console. This is also the first time we linked Madden Mobile to console Madden and we saw hundreds of thousands of mobile players registered in the first tranche of Madden NFL 21 buyers. Credit is also due to the Respawn teams and the quality of the content that they have been adding to Apex Legends. Apex Legends net booking came in 24% above what we had last year and is off to an incredibly strong start in Q3. We started the year expecting Apex Legends to deliver $300 million to $400 million in net bookings is now on track to deliver more than $500 million. That is Apex will have gone from $0 billion to about $1 billion in lifetime net bookings in just two years. With this velocity and the addition of mobile we believe Apex has the potential to grow to $1 billion in net bookings every year. This is what we do. We've done it with FIFA. We've done it with Madden. We've done it with the Sims and we're doing it again with Apex due to the amazing teams that we have really driving this business. Mobile grew year-on-year again and we're excited about a new title slate for this platform particularly the Apex Legends and soccer games that Andrew discussed. It's been a strong three months for launching new EA games. We launched Madden NFL 21 Star Wars: Squadrons UFC 4 in the quarter along with Rocket Arena from Final Strike Games. Squadrons is the latest example of the power of our licensing model in which we leverage the synergy between well-loved IP and the skills of our development teams to bring extraordinary new experiences to fans and gamers. The FIFA franchise continues to grow. FIFA 20 attracted 12% more players than FIFA 2019 and engagement remains strong making FIFA 20 the most successful FIFA game in the 27-year history of the franchise. FIFA 21 launched after quarter end and is off to a great start with live services net bookings for the first three weeks up relative to the comparable period last year. FIFA Ultimate Team contributes to be the most popular mode in the game and also the most engaging for players. After eight weeks of Madden NFL 21, digital accounted for 66% of units sold through the players. After the first three weeks of FIFA 21 number was 50%. These are both up 14 points year-over-year and we believe this step-up is likely a permanent structural change driven by the COVID shelter-in-place orders. This adds up to six new games launched since the beginning of Q2 including blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Madden and fan favorites like Star Wars: Squadrons. This is more than our peers manage in a year, the further testimony to our team's ability to execute under difficult circumstances. We've reached more players with the EA PLAY this quarter with the launch of the subscription service on Steam. In addition, Microsoft has noted the value of EA PLAY will bring to their game pass ultimate and we expect making it available on that platform will lead to another step-up in EA PLAY subscribers. Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations driven primarily by variable compensation and phasing of marketing investments. We had a new record in trailing 12-month cash flow of $2.04 billion. The strength and dependability of our cash flow has led us to start a new repurchase program this quarter and to initiate a dividend for the first time in the company's history. The share repurchase authorization is for a $2.6 billion program over two years. Our Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, which represents an annualized yield of about 0.5% calculated as of the close of the market on November 4. As a result, we expect to return a total of $3 billion to investors over the next 24 months. We're now looking ahead to the launches of the new Playstation and Xbox. Console transitions have historically driven broad industry growth and our opportunities to grow our franchises. In particular, owners of NFL 21 and FIFA 21 for the current generation of consoles can upgrade for free to the next-generation versions any time before the launch of the 22nd or 22 versions of game next year. In addition, we expect to leverage the ongoing strength of FIFA 20 engagement and building an even larger audience for FIFA 21. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remain $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.485 billion, and earnings per share of $3.15. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. See our earnings slides and further cash flow information for more details. Remember that, our guidance EPS calculation do not factor in any share repurchases. We expect net bookings for the year to be $5.95 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. This is driven by ongoing strength in our live services offset by the move of Apex Legends on Switch, and the extra time, we're giving to our EA originals titles. Versus our expectations last quarter, those changes amount to about $120 million of net bookings moved out of the fiscal 2021 year that will benefit fiscal 2022. The annual guidance factors in an FX headwind of about $80 million. And as you build your models note, that we are forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year, due to the sustained low interest rates the world is experiencing. For the third quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $599 million and operating expenses of $840 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the third quarter to be $2.35 billion, which would make it the largest quarter in EA history. Some context for this guidance, we are now guiding fiscal 2021 net bookings to be 11% higher than fiscal 2020. This is incredible growth some driven by the shelter-in-place orders, but much also driven by the work our teams do every day in bringing new live services content and games to players. Even with a strong year, we still expect net bookings and earnings to grow next year. The growth will be driven by a great slate of new titles, including Battlefield, our blockbuster sports titles Need For Speed and the titles we moved out of fiscal 2021 to 2022. We anticipate a strong performance from our live services and we continue to bring our franchises to new platforms, for example, bringing Apex Legends to mobile. With that, I will now turn it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. Games are becoming essential trait of the digital lifestyle for people around the world. With more players than ever continuing to connect and engage through our franchises, our business has grown significantly this year, and we are confident of projecting meaningful growth into FY 2022 and beyond. We hope everybody stays healthy and enjoy some great games this holiday season. And now Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you so much. I'm curious to what trends you might be seeing in Europe and the U.S. now that we see kind of resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Do you think that the second wave potentially could be a bit different than what you saw kind of earlier this year? In the sense, people may have more pandemic fatigue and maybe less of a tailwind for sort of engaging in video gaming?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. Let me jump in first. I appreciate the question. It's a good question. I think the thing to note is unlike say March, when virtually the whole world shutdown at the same time, we're seeing stages of changes in different communities around the world. And so we don't expect that we would see the surge that we saw before. But we also know that, as we get into winter, flu season other things. And I don't want to predict the COVID path, because that's way out of my expertise. But we do know that people will continue to gravitate to online entertainment. And what we also know is that, much of the traditional entertainment i.e. movies, TV have been stalled because of the COVID situation. And so, people will drift towards more and more online entertainment, which we know they're going to engage in, because we've seen that in the past. And we will continue to do things to try to help people understand, why it is a great way to engage with things they love be it sports, be it the Sims be whatever it is. Hard to say and I will tell you we have been very careful, not to try to predict that in our guidance. And thus, the reason that we've provided the guidance, we've provided because it is a world in which we have never been in before. And so trust that, we'll keep investors and the sell-side up-to-date, as we see things, but we want to also be really careful, because of the world that as I said, we just don't have a lot of history in. And we want to be really careful, but we also want to know that, we are one of the most important entertainment vehicles, for people during this difficult time.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up if I may. Any update on the outlook for China game approvals for Apex?\nBlake Jorgensen: It is a very hard thing to predict. What we know is with our partners in China, we are very optimistic. But guessing approvals is really difficult. But we're optimistic. We believe that, this is something that we can ultimately get approval on. But more importantly remember the mobile game for Apex outside of China, China doesn't require approval. And so it's more about making sure the game is correct, testing the game and then rolling it out in the key markets. And we're pretty confident on all of those. As we talked about, the Japanese market is one of the largest markets for Apex, second largest in the world. We believe that there's a huge opportunity for mobile in that market. And so, we will continue to focus on, where we think those largest markets are for early rollout. And we'll keep people informed, as we start to test the game. And get it into the market. But I think as Andrew said, in his comments, we believe that's coming in the coming fiscal 2022. And we're excited -- we're very excited about the opportunity there.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you so much.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAlex Giaimo: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Andrew curious if you could provide any more color on the EA PLAY partnership, with Microsoft Game Pass, I guess why does the partnership make sense for EA? And why is it appealing? And then Blake if you could just provide any broad commentary around, how the economics of that deal works? That would be helpful. Thank you, guys.\nAndrew Wilson: In terms of why it makes sense for us, again our objective from the very beginning has been to ensure that players can access our subscription on any platform, in any way that makes sense for them, to the best value gaming opportunity in the marketplace. We have strong partnership with Microsoft and Sony and Steam. And of course we have our own platform with EA PLAY. And as we looked at it we saw this as an opportunity to build, an access point for our EA PLAY subscription on the Microsoft platform. We saw it as a way to give gamers easy and frictionless access. We will -- as part of that this is not just putting our games at Microsoft subscription, this is actually an entitlement to the EA PLAY subscription. And as a result of that the relationship that we have, with those players who make those subscriptions, they will be the same as if we sold it outside the platform. So you'll continue to see us think about our subscription broadly across platforms. And making it available to any player wherever they want, in any way they need, with as little friction as possible.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. What I would say is that, I can't give you details on the exact economics. You can imagine that, Microsoft wanted us to be part of their subscription. We thought it was a great opportunity and there's a positive economic impact on that. When it comes to giving guidance next year, we probably still won't give detail because it's not that big of an overall business. I think to Andrew's point is the real goal is how do we grow our subscription and also help Microsoft grow their subscription. I mean this is a great partnership with them. And we're really looking. We are \u2013 think about it as we're in the very early days of the industry on subscriptions for games and we're doing everything possible to help consumers understand, why it is a great potential for them to either be introduced to new games, play the games they love or play games for a great value. And so more to come on it but you should also trust \u2013 we don't do anything for free. So we \u2013 and Microsoft to figure it out the right way I think the economics work for both of us and that's how we've approached it.\nAlex Giaimo: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMario Lu: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple on Madden. You guys mentioned that Madden NFL 21 has 30% more players year-on-year. I understand that the title has a new mode this year called The Yard. So any color you can provide on how that mode is performing and if it was a driver to either player or engagement growth. And just in the future are there any plans to monetize either The Yard or for FIFA the Volta mode directly? Or do you think it's just best suited as an engagement enhancer? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. Again, when we think about Madden and we think about FIFA for that matter, we really think about as a platform to bring the fans of these sports together to engage in interactive consumption of the sport. And 10, 15 years ago we would have had multiple games, arcade style, simulation style, management style, that we would put in the marketplace as separate packaged goods. As we've really transformed our business into the world of digital as we've moved the experience from product to service for our players, what our players have also told us is they want us to keep them together. They want to come together, regardless of what format they're engaging with. And so as we continue to develop the Madden franchise, as we continue the FIFA franchise, you should expect that we'll continue to add these new modalities of play to the product or to the service. What we've seen so far this year in Madden is there's been really good and strong engagement in The Yard. It's early \u2013 it's still early in its life cycle. But it's offering this opportunity for people to come into the franchise in a new way and play a more casual experience. If they haven't really wanted to engage in the full 11 V11 experience that he is going to buy. But it also allows our harder core players to do something a little different, a little more social and a little faster paced than the traditional Madden game. And so overall we feel like it adds a substantial element to the overall player experience both for new players and returning players. And the same has been true for Volta inside of FIFA. In the context of cosmetic sale items we'll start to experiment with that. What we've seen across the industry is when done right the purchase of cosmetics that allow you to individualize and personalize your experience and build status in that environment as you play with your friends have been really, really well received. We expect that will be no different in Madden and FIFA over time and we'll start to work with our gaming communities as to what are the right things to them? What kind of cosmetics they look like? What are most authentic and relatable to the sports that they're playing in? And what gives them the opportunity to be unique in these large growing communities?\nMario Lu: Okay. Thank you.\nChris Evenden: Sorry, Jason I don't think we have any more questions in the queue, right?\nOperator: My apologies, we are going to do one last\u2026\nChris Evenden: We still got one, okay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a couple more questions. Your next question is from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I think this was almost back in July. I think you guys hired a new head of Mobile games, I think Jeff Karp, I believe. So I'm just wondering what you think he's going to do, that's different versus the prior management of that segment. Because I think we've been kind of waiting for some of your larger franchises to become hits on Mobile as well. So what you think the road map is going to be for the future for these entertainment properties to reach an audience that's hopefully multiples of what you have now? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. And we're really happy and excited to welcome Jeff back to the organization. He has been an EA veteran and held very senior leadership roles in the company some number of years ago, but spent the best part of the last decade in kind of mobile-first organizations and comes back to us with unbelievable experience and tremendous expertise. And we are now -- you heard me talk about six new FIFA titles. You hear us talk about the push with Apex Legends. What I would tell you is, Jeff has come back and made three core assessments. The first is that we have an existing portfolio of games that are tremendously profitable, but have significant more opportunity for engagement and monetization than we're presently doing with some changes to the organization and some changes to how we run those live services. And he's already started to work with leaders and we brought a number of new leaders from across the mobile industry into our company and they are going through each one of our franchises and looking for opportunities to deliver new content, new experiences and new services to players that will drive higher engagement and result in monetization in our existing franchises. The second thing he has done has come in and said, there are a number of key franchises like FIFA who have unbelievable exponential opportunity around the world. And he's put in motion a series of internal development and external development that will really start to execute against our big franchises like FIFA and some others that we will be able to talk about more soon. And then the third thing is, he also has a tremendous network out there in the mobile sphere. And there are a lot of great developers out there who have really great games and really great game mechanics and lot of experience and expertise, but they do not have the IP to build their games around or the marketing muscle to really drive acquisition and what is becoming an increasingly competitive market. And so Jeff is also doing a lot of outreach with external developers and publishers and looking at ways that we could partner differently with them with our slate of IP and with our marketing muscle. Either in the context of licensing or co-development or co-publishing or in some cases acquisition. And so I've not been more excited for a number of years about what I think we're going to be able to achieve in our mobile business. And again, what we know is mobile is tremendously competitive. It's somewhat unpredictable. There are a lot of games that come to app stores on an annualized basis. But we are seeing that where you build games with great teams around trusted IP that offer unbelievable experience and value to players that monetization opportunity is very, very strong. And we're confident about that going into FY 2022 with FIFA and Apex Legends and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and others. But certainly as we look out further into 2023 and 2024, we feel like we're well positioned there as well.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Berg from Berenberg. Your line is open.\nRobert Berg: Hi. Yes. Thanks for question. I'm just on next-generation interestedly here, you're thinking behind the free next year upgrades that you're offering for FIFA, for example versus the higher price that some of your peers charging to their games, and how you set it on your current strategy? And then a quick follow-up with whether you think that even with the free upgrade path the next-gen consoles is delaying the purchasing decisions of any of your players even in a few weeks or months? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I would say, I mean, we've always known and we've seen over history that people will delay purchases without gap. I mean, it's just -- it's natural in a console transition. But I would also remember that there will only be a small amount and this is not a negative on Sony or Microsoft business is just a reality of how many consoles they can produce. Dave I think both publicly talked about eight million, 10 million, 11 million, 12 million consoles in the market between now and the end of March, because that -- it's just reality right? So we know that some people will wait, but also some people will upgrade over time. And the reason we did the upgrade program is, we wanted to make sure people felt that they would be comfortable buying the Gen 4 version and the notion that they would be able to upgrade without any problems. And it's all about the consumer experience, it's about making sure you're staying connected to your social network that plays the same game that you're playing. And we didn't want anyone to feel like for some reason because they didn't want to -- or they wanted to wait for a new console that they didn't fall out of the key component of what is so important in our games, which is the ability to play with your friends. And it's not much more complicated than that. We do think if we look back on past console transitions, we know that it will take time to build the inventory and the level of new consoles. But we also know based on what we've seen in the new consoles, it will add incredible opportunities for us to build better and better games over time because of more power, and that's what we're really excited about. And as we've talked about we will build a series of games this year and continue to add to that no different than we've done in past console cycles. And I think the rest of the industry is that way. And that's how people approach it, but it is where it gets really, really exciting a year or two years from now, because I will tell you games are going to be unbelievable when you start to see them a year or two years from now in the new consoles. \nRobert Berg: And a quick follow-up if I can. The games are going to be hopefully as I believe what you said, do you think that warrants a higher price point in the future?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. I mean, I don't really want to weigh in on that yet. We've always said that games are getting more expensive. The experience is getting deeper. The time that people are playing games is getting longer. One might argue that that might require a higher price point over time. But we'll address that as we get closer to more games coming into the next-gen console transition. And what I default back to is let's stay focused on the excitement of what we can do with the new games and price will follow that. We'll figure that out. And I don't want people to read into that. We're going to raise prices or not. We don't know yet. What we do know is we're going to be able to do a lot more things with the new consoles and our partnerships with the new console Sony and Microsoft and others that are making the consoles.\nRobert Berg: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nChris Evenden: Jason, could you give us the next question please?\nOperator: My apologies, I was muted. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Hey, thanks for letting me take the question. I have a couple of questions. The first one is could you give us a little history lesson on the impact that new consoles have on sports titles? It seems that the new powerful consoles could do a lot pretty quickly for ball physics and bodies and crowds and audiences. So do you normally see a pickup within the sports franchises in the first couple of years of a console cycle?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah, I'll let Andrew answer that because he's lived this a lot more than I have. \nAndrew Wilson: The short answer is yes. I've been doing this for a long time now. And most of my career before I was fortunate enough to have this job I was building sports video games. And so I went through a number of consoles. And I would tell you not only do we see the market grow considerably. If you go back and look through history every console transition meaningfully grows the market and top-tier frontline sports games almost always drive a lot of that growth and benefit from the growth in player engagement as those console transitions move through and a bigger market buys into the new console generation. We think about game development in terms of kind of what can you do with a core technology level what can you do at a future level? And what can you do at a social level and as we've gone through generations, the intelligence and the believability of plays in a sports game it's had a step change in immersion and authenticity and realism each console generation. If you go back you want the history lesson PS2 was all about can you make athletes look like the real-world athlete? PS3 or the next-generation was all about can you make the moves like real athletes. The generation that we're now is can you make them remote like real athletes? And as we look at the next-generation of platforms, it's can you bring all of those together and add a level of intelligence to those players that upholds the suspense and this belief that you are in fact engaging with real athletes in a real game on a real pitch. And so I expect that we will continue to do and drive unbelievable new development in the context of the base technology that drives the game play. The second thing that you'll also see as we move through transition is modality shift how people play single player to multiplayer, multiplier to cooperative play. And you'll see us continue to do that with the power of these new platforms and how we can bring players together in new modalities of play. And you're starting to see some of those things with how we started with Volta how we've started with The Yard and you should expect that we'll continue to expand the modalities of play on new platforms. And then last and this happened as we move from offline to online. It's really the social nature of the game and how you tie the game to the real-world of sport. And you heard me talk about how we're building Madden so that there is a greater influence of what's happening in the real-world of sport on your game. But you should also imagine that we'll start to think about how do we use the technology in these new platforms, how do we use them plus the combination of the cloud to bring millions and millions of players together in a social ecosystem around the consumption of their favorite sport. And we're excited by that as much as the base technology quite frankly, because these are becoming social networks for sports fans and COVID has accelerated that for us as the consumption of sport more broadly has moved from lean to interactive and physical interaction has moved -- social interactions move from physical to digital. So as we think about the combination of the base technology that influence gameplay the different modalities of play that the new platforms will enable and the new platforms combined with the cloud to offer an expansion of the social network orientation of these games, we're really excited about the future. And you tie that into what will almost certainly be a growing marketplace. We think we have tremendous opportunity not just this year, but in many years to come. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Awesome. I appreciate the enthusiasm for the game technology. It's great color. And if I can just sneak one more in? Blake, last quarter you mentioned you remain very interested in M&A and want to be active there. How should investors square that thought with the buyback and the new dividend. Can you give us your latest thoughts on M&A?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I would not connect the dots between the buyback or dividend with M&A. I mean we -- I think you all know we're on a consistent path of buyback and we paused it at the end of the last part of the buyback program when we finished it at the end of March because we were going into COVID and I think we were pretty transparent with people that it wasn't just a street issue. It was also a concern around how our employees thought about, how we are spending our money. And we feel more confident of that today. And in fact, I would say we feel more confident because we've added the dividend. Now the reality is, if we're talking about the buyback level and the dividend level we're still either under or coming close to our annual cash flow. And we have substantial cash on the balance sheet and substantial debt capacity. So don't read into that as the inability or lack of desire to do any acquisitions. We are incredibly focused on what could we buy, but at the same time, we're also focused on making sure we don't destroy shareholder value in buying and doing an acquisition. And I don't want to comment on any individual acquisitions, but it's a balance of driving growth but at the same time, being responsible with your guy's capital because that's with investors' capital because that's what really matters to us. What I would say though is, the one thing to read into the buyback and the dividend is an incredible confidence in the business. And that's not short-term confidence because that's not how we operate the company. I remind people we increased our guidance by almost $500 million at the end of the first quarter. And if many of you have been around a long time, we've almost rarely ever increased guidance coming out of the first quarter. And granted we had the COVID situation that created one of the greatest first quarters, unfortunately because of the situation that was going on around the world. But what we are continuing to do is feel very, very confident about our business. I don't want anyone to read the fact that we may not be raising guidance now as a negative because we need to all remember we've raised guidance $500 million during the year. We thought we were going to do $5.55 billion and we're talking about close to $6 billion and what you heard from Andrew and I today as we're planning on growth again next year. That's the most important message. What I will also tell you is, if anyone can predict right now what's going to happen in the economy over the next three months or six months call me and tell me. Because it is going to be very difficult and we are very careful in how we present and focus our guidance in our business, but we are very confident in the strength of our business right now. And we are seeing things as we mentioned. A simple example Apex Japan and we don't know when it will happen. But if it happens, it will be big. There is so many different things inside our business that are so strong that we are very, very excited about where it can go. So I just -- I don't want anyone to get ahead of themselves on guidance, but I don't want anyone to think that the message we're sending out is in any way negative that we haven't raised guidance because remember we raised guidance by $500 million and we've told people we're going to grow again next year. So keep it in that context that's where it gets exciting. That's where the opportunity is. I know that's not the question you asked, but don't read anything into things like share repurchase or dividend as a negative. They're all positive. It's a commitment and a confidence in the business that I think we're -- that's where Andrew and I are and why it's so exciting in our industry is so exciting going forward. So sorry to a little too much more than everyone wanted to hear, but I just -- I think both Andrew and I are really passionate about where we think this is going. And we want to make sure people don't get over indexed on the short-term and they actually read what we're telling people as the real opportunity. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: No I think that's -- I think that's great color. I appreciate that. I think that's a lot of the questions I've been getting so far tonight. Had a mixed feeling, but I can't even predict what I'm having for dinner tonight. So great quarter and we'll talk to you next month. \nBlake Jorgensen: Thank you. Chris any more questions in the queue? \nOperator: There certainly is. Your final question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies. Your line is open\nAlex Giaimo: Thanks, guys. Thanks for let me hop back on. We've seen a lot of game delays in the space recently and even on the AAA side. So, just curious as you think towards next year in Battlefield obviously that's a big theme for fiscal 2022. So just curious if you can provide an update about how you're feeling about the development process? And if there's any risk a year from now that maybe that game doesn't launch on time? It would be helpful to get an update there. Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Great question. Again, if you look at our prepared remarks and the conversation we've had today, we've launched eight games and over 200 live services and season seven of Apex Legends during this time. Working from home is -- there's no doubt it's extraordinarily hard and we're doing all we can to support our teams in any way we can. There are some benefits that come from having our scale and having our organizational structure that allows us greater fluidity of our talent. We're able to move talent from project-to-project. We're able to kind of leverage our scale in the development process. And you've seen that play out this year in our ability to launch as much high-quality content as we have.  And even as of 11:00 a.m. this morning, season seven of Apex Legends is on track to be our largest launch day since the launch of the product. Steam in the first rolled out performance has been extremely strong. Our new champion edition is already a top three bestseller on Steam. We've had the most minutes watched on Twitch since the launch of the product. So another testament to just the unbelievable, inspirational capabilities of our teams and our ability to continue to deliver amazing games experiences and content in the face of these ongoing challenges.  As we think about Battlefield next year again you heard me talk about we're doing internal play testing. We're starting to go out to our community and get feedback. I was part of the product review last week. We have rallied that entire studio around the development of Battlefield specifically. We've given them an extra year of development.  You'll remember to ensure that they can in fact build a true next-gen vision around that game. DICE is one of the most talented studios on the planet and we've been able to add leadership from our EA SPORTS business and David Rutter who understands both live services and the rigor of development. We've brought in talent from across the industry who have really bolstered our belief and our confidence in our ability to launch that game next year. So lots more to come in the next couple of months.  But even in the face of challenges I think we've demonstrated an ability to launch amazing games and content. I feel really, really good about the content we're coming next year. And part of why we have the confidence in FY 2022 that we have to grow off this year which is going to be an unbelievably extraordinary record year for us is because our scale and our organizational structure and our amazing talent, our amazing people are really coming together to deliver amazing content next year. \nAlex Giaimo: Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: So with that I'll turn it back to Andrew just to a couple of closing remarks. I do thank everybody for spending the time and the commitment on following us. And obviously you know you can always connect with Chris, Aaron, myself and others on any questions, but I'll turn it back to Andrew. \nAndrew Wilson : Yes. And thank you everyone for joining us and we do hope you stay safe and healthy in what appears to be a second surge of COVID in parts of the world. What I think you've earn from me today is extremely confidence in where we're at right now and where we're going for our business. We've had strength and growth in our business this year already forecasting 11% growth year-over-year for FY 2021.  We've launched great new games in content FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims all continue to be major growth drivers and we've got further expansion opportunities this year and beyond. We are excited for the upcoming console launches. New hardware has historically always grown the market and offers us another opportunity to grow FIFA and Madden franchises with our next-gen games and we're projecting continued growth in fiscal year FY 2022 and beyond with an expansion of our sports portfolio a double down in mobile extension of our live services and of course, a new Battlefield game.  So thank you for being here today. Thanks for your questions. Be well. Thank you so much. \nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for joining today. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew and I will echo what you said earlier which is we hope all of you on the phone are healthy, your families are healthy and you're dealing with this amazing challenge. We continue to be unbelievably impressed by how our teams have actually delivered. And Andrew talked about that and it is just a testament to the strength of Electronic Arts. As you know from Chris' introduction, we're trying something a little different with our earnings call this quarter. And you should listen to my prepared remarks in conjunction with the expanded presentation we've posted on our Investor Relations website earlier today. It contains the metrics and the color I would normally read and bore you with. But hopefully, it gives you a lot more information than maybe you might hear through the call. This approach gives us more time for analysis and more time for your questions. So with that I'd like to briefly highlight a few points. We came in well above our guidance for the quarter. The beat was driven by our live services led by Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA Ultimate Team. First week sell-through for Madden was up nearly 20% year-on-year and this after Madden NFL 20 turning the best year ever for Madden on console. This is also the first time we linked Madden Mobile to console Madden and we saw hundreds of thousands of mobile players registered in the first tranche of Madden NFL 21 buyers. Credit is also due to the Respawn teams and the quality of the content that they have been adding to Apex Legends. Apex Legends net booking came in 24% above what we had last year and is off to an incredibly strong start in Q3. We started the year expecting Apex Legends to deliver $300 million to $400 million in net bookings is now on track to deliver more than $500 million. That is Apex will have gone from $0 billion to about $1 billion in lifetime net bookings in just two years. With this velocity and the addition of mobile we believe Apex has the potential to grow to $1 billion in net bookings every year. This is what we do. We've done it with FIFA. We've done it with Madden. We've done it with the Sims and we're doing it again with Apex due to the amazing teams that we have really driving this business. Mobile grew year-on-year again and we're excited about a new title slate for this platform particularly the Apex Legends and soccer games that Andrew discussed. It's been a strong three months for launching new EA games. We launched Madden NFL 21 Star Wars: Squadrons UFC 4 in the quarter along with Rocket Arena from Final Strike Games. Squadrons is the latest example of the power of our licensing model in which we leverage the synergy between well-loved IP and the skills of our development teams to bring extraordinary new experiences to fans and gamers. The FIFA franchise continues to grow. FIFA 20 attracted 12% more players than FIFA 2019 and engagement remains strong making FIFA 20 the most successful FIFA game in the 27-year history of the franchise. FIFA 21 launched after quarter end and is off to a great start with live services net bookings for the first three weeks up relative to the comparable period last year. FIFA Ultimate Team contributes to be the most popular mode in the game and also the most engaging for players. After eight weeks of Madden NFL 21, digital accounted for 66% of units sold through the players. After the first three weeks of FIFA 21 number was 50%. These are both up 14 points year-over-year and we believe this step-up is likely a permanent structural change driven by the COVID shelter-in-place orders. This adds up to six new games launched since the beginning of Q2 including blockbuster franchises like FIFA and Madden and fan favorites like Star Wars: Squadrons. This is more than our peers manage in a year, the further testimony to our team's ability to execute under difficult circumstances. We've reached more players with the EA PLAY this quarter with the launch of the subscription service on Steam. In addition, Microsoft has noted the value of EA PLAY will bring to their game pass ultimate and we expect making it available on that platform will lead to another step-up in EA PLAY subscribers. Operating expenses came in materially below our expectations driven primarily by variable compensation and phasing of marketing investments. We had a new record in trailing 12-month cash flow of $2.04 billion. The strength and dependability of our cash flow has led us to start a new repurchase program this quarter and to initiate a dividend for the first time in the company's history. The share repurchase authorization is for a $2.6 billion program over two years. Our Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, which represents an annualized yield of about 0.5% calculated as of the close of the market on November 4. As a result, we expect to return a total of $3 billion to investors over the next 24 months. We're now looking ahead to the launches of the new Playstation and Xbox. Console transitions have historically driven broad industry growth and our opportunities to grow our franchises. In particular, owners of NFL 21 and FIFA 21 for the current generation of consoles can upgrade for free to the next-generation versions any time before the launch of the 22nd or 22 versions of game next year. In addition, we expect to leverage the ongoing strength of FIFA 20 engagement and building an even larger audience for FIFA 21. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remain $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.485 billion, and earnings per share of $3.15. We are reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion. See our earnings slides and further cash flow information for more details. Remember that, our guidance EPS calculation do not factor in any share repurchases. We expect net bookings for the year to be $5.95 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. This is driven by ongoing strength in our live services offset by the move of Apex Legends on Switch, and the extra time, we're giving to our EA originals titles. Versus our expectations last quarter, those changes amount to about $120 million of net bookings moved out of the fiscal 2021 year that will benefit fiscal 2022. The annual guidance factors in an FX headwind of about $80 million. And as you build your models note, that we are forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year, due to the sustained low interest rates the world is experiencing. For the third quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $599 million and operating expenses of $840 million. This resulted in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the third quarter to be $2.35 billion, which would make it the largest quarter in EA history. Some context for this guidance, we are now guiding fiscal 2021 net bookings to be 11% higher than fiscal 2020. This is incredible growth some driven by the shelter-in-place orders, but much also driven by the work our teams do every day in bringing new live services content and games to players. Even with a strong year, we still expect net bookings and earnings to grow next year. The growth will be driven by a great slate of new titles, including Battlefield, our blockbuster sports titles Need For Speed and the titles we moved out of fiscal 2021 to 2022. We anticipate a strong performance from our live services and we continue to bring our franchises to new platforms, for example, bringing Apex Legends to mobile. With that, I will now turn it back to Andrew. Yeah. Let me jump in first. I appreciate the question. It's a good question. I think the thing to note is unlike say March, when virtually the whole world shutdown at the same time, we're seeing stages of changes in different communities around the world. And so we don't expect that we would see the surge that we saw before. But we also know that, as we get into winter, flu season other things. And I don't want to predict the COVID path, because that's way out of my expertise. But we do know that people will continue to gravitate to online entertainment. And what we also know is that, much of the traditional entertainment i.e. movies, TV have been stalled because of the COVID situation. And so, people will drift towards more and more online entertainment, which we know they're going to engage in, because we've seen that in the past. And we will continue to do things to try to help people understand, why it is a great way to engage with things they love be it sports, be it the Sims be whatever it is. Hard to say and I will tell you we have been very careful, not to try to predict that in our guidance. And thus, the reason that we've provided the guidance, we've provided because it is a world in which we have never been in before. And so trust that, we'll keep investors and the sell-side up-to-date, as we see things, but we want to also be really careful, because of the world that as I said, we just don't have a lot of history in. And we want to be really careful, but we also want to know that, we are one of the most important entertainment vehicles, for people during this difficult time. It is a very hard thing to predict. What we know is with our partners in China, we are very optimistic. But guessing approvals is really difficult. But we're optimistic. We believe that, this is something that we can ultimately get approval on. But more importantly remember the mobile game for Apex outside of China, China doesn't require approval. And so it's more about making sure the game is correct, testing the game and then rolling it out in the key markets. And we're pretty confident on all of those. As we talked about, the Japanese market is one of the largest markets for Apex, second largest in the world. We believe that there's a huge opportunity for mobile in that market. And so, we will continue to focus on, where we think those largest markets are for early rollout. And we'll keep people informed, as we start to test the game. And get it into the market. But I think as Andrew said, in his comments, we believe that's coming in the coming fiscal 2022. And we're excited -- we're very excited about the opportunity there. Thanks. Yeah. What I would say is that, I can't give you details on the exact economics. You can imagine that, Microsoft wanted us to be part of their subscription. We thought it was a great opportunity and there's a positive economic impact on that. When it comes to giving guidance next year, we probably still won't give detail because it's not that big of an overall business. I think to Andrew's point is the real goal is how do we grow our subscription and also help Microsoft grow their subscription. I mean this is a great partnership with them. And we're really looking. We are \u2013 think about it as we're in the very early days of the industry on subscriptions for games and we're doing everything possible to help consumers understand, why it is a great potential for them to either be introduced to new games, play the games they love or play games for a great value. And so more to come on it but you should also trust \u2013 we don't do anything for free. So we \u2013 and Microsoft to figure it out the right way I think the economics work for both of us and that's how we've approached it. Thanks. Yes. I would say, I mean, we've always known and we've seen over history that people will delay purchases without gap. I mean, it's just -- it's natural in a console transition. But I would also remember that there will only be a small amount and this is not a negative on Sony or Microsoft business is just a reality of how many consoles they can produce. Dave I think both publicly talked about eight million, 10 million, 11 million, 12 million consoles in the market between now and the end of March, because that -- it's just reality right? So we know that some people will wait, but also some people will upgrade over time. And the reason we did the upgrade program is, we wanted to make sure people felt that they would be comfortable buying the Gen 4 version and the notion that they would be able to upgrade without any problems. And it's all about the consumer experience, it's about making sure you're staying connected to your social network that plays the same game that you're playing. And we didn't want anyone to feel like for some reason because they didn't want to -- or they wanted to wait for a new console that they didn't fall out of the key component of what is so important in our games, which is the ability to play with your friends. And it's not much more complicated than that. We do think if we look back on past console transitions, we know that it will take time to build the inventory and the level of new consoles. But we also know based on what we've seen in the new consoles, it will add incredible opportunities for us to build better and better games over time because of more power, and that's what we're really excited about. And as we've talked about we will build a series of games this year and continue to add to that no different than we've done in past console cycles. And I think the rest of the industry is that way. And that's how people approach it, but it is where it gets really, really exciting a year or two years from now, because I will tell you games are going to be unbelievable when you start to see them a year or two years from now in the new consoles. Yeah. I mean, I don't really want to weigh in on that yet. We've always said that games are getting more expensive. The experience is getting deeper. The time that people are playing games is getting longer. One might argue that that might require a higher price point over time. But we'll address that as we get closer to more games coming into the next-gen console transition. And what I default back to is let's stay focused on the excitement of what we can do with the new games and price will follow that. We'll figure that out. And I don't want people to read into that. We're going to raise prices or not. We don't know yet. What we do know is we're going to be able to do a lot more things with the new consoles and our partnerships with the new console Sony and Microsoft and others that are making the consoles. Yeah, I'll let Andrew answer that because he's lived this a lot more than I have. Yes. I would not connect the dots between the buyback or dividend with M&A. I mean we -- I think you all know we're on a consistent path of buyback and we paused it at the end of the last part of the buyback program when we finished it at the end of March because we were going into COVID and I think we were pretty transparent with people that it wasn't just a street issue. It was also a concern around how our employees thought about, how we are spending our money. And we feel more confident of that today. And in fact, I would say we feel more confident because we've added the dividend. Now the reality is, if we're talking about the buyback level and the dividend level we're still either under or coming close to our annual cash flow. And we have substantial cash on the balance sheet and substantial debt capacity. So don't read into that as the inability or lack of desire to do any acquisitions. We are incredibly focused on what could we buy, but at the same time, we're also focused on making sure we don't destroy shareholder value in buying and doing an acquisition. And I don't want to comment on any individual acquisitions, but it's a balance of driving growth but at the same time, being responsible with your guy's capital because that's with investors' capital because that's what really matters to us. What I would say though is, the one thing to read into the buyback and the dividend is an incredible confidence in the business. And that's not short-term confidence because that's not how we operate the company. I remind people we increased our guidance by almost $500 million at the end of the first quarter. And if many of you have been around a long time, we've almost rarely ever increased guidance coming out of the first quarter. And granted we had the COVID situation that created one of the greatest first quarters, unfortunately because of the situation that was going on around the world. But what we are continuing to do is feel very, very confident about our business. I don't want anyone to read the fact that we may not be raising guidance now as a negative because we need to all remember we've raised guidance $500 million during the year. We thought we were going to do $5.55 billion and we're talking about close to $6 billion and what you heard from Andrew and I today as we're planning on growth again next year. That's the most important message. What I will also tell you is, if anyone can predict right now what's going to happen in the economy over the next three months or six months call me and tell me. Because it is going to be very difficult and we are very careful in how we present and focus our guidance in our business, but we are very confident in the strength of our business right now. And we are seeing things as we mentioned. A simple example Apex Japan and we don't know when it will happen. But if it happens, it will be big. There is so many different things inside our business that are so strong that we are very, very excited about where it can go. So I just -- I don't want anyone to get ahead of themselves on guidance, but I don't want anyone to think that the message we're sending out is in any way negative that we haven't raised guidance because remember we raised guidance by $500 million and we've told people we're going to grow again next year. So keep it in that context that's where it gets exciting. That's where the opportunity is. I know that's not the question you asked, but don't read anything into things like share repurchase or dividend as a negative. They're all positive. It's a commitment and a confidence in the business that I think we're -- that's where Andrew and I are and why it's so exciting in our industry is so exciting going forward. So sorry to a little too much more than everyone wanted to hear, but I just -- I think both Andrew and I are really passionate about where we think this is going. And we want to make sure people don't get over indexed on the short-term and they actually read what we're telling people as the real opportunity. Thank you. Chris any more questions in the queue? So with that I'll turn it back to Andrew just to a couple of closing remarks. I do thank everybody for spending the time and the commitment on following us. And obviously you know you can always connect with Chris, Aaron, myself and others on any questions, but I'll turn it back to Andrew."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I hope this find everyone well and staying healthy amidst the ongoing pandemic. After the biggest first quarter in the history of Electronic Arts, our second quarter of FY 2021 showed continued strength with net revenue and earnings above our guidance. We are driving growth through the breadth, depth and quality of our new games, our industry-leading live services and expansion to more platforms and more ways to play. Let me first say, how thankful I am to our teams for their incredible work and everything they are delivering for our players. The well-being of our people remains our top priority. Even amidst these unprecedented circumstances, we are executing and building great strength across our business. Here are a few key examples. We delivered eight new games so far this year, and our network has grown to more than 330 million unique accounts as tens of millions of new players have joined to enjoy more of our amazing games and content. EA SPORTS continues to be a leader in sports interactive entertainment. Madden NFL 20 was the most successful game in franchise history last year and now Madden NFL 21 already has nearly 30% more players year-over-year from launch. Our FIFA franchise is engaging more than 100 million players globally. Even prior to launching FIFA 21 our FIFA franchise is having the biggest calendar year ever with our business across all platforms up 26% year-over-year in net bookings. FIFA 20 has reached nearly 35 million players on console and PC. FIFA Mobile continues to perform well and FIFA Online Asia broke engagement records across China and Korea in Q2. We just launched FIFA Mobile in Japan in October, as we continue to see significant international expansion opportunities for our FIFA franchise. We continue to have an outstanding relationship with Disney and Lucasfilms. Star Wars: Squadrons launched a great feedback from critics and the community and has performed above our expectations. This is clearly a special game for fans and continues the extraordinary success we've had bringing great games to life with this IP, including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Star Wars Battlefront franchise. Our live services are among the most successful in the industry and our live services net bookings have grown more than 28% fiscal year-over-year to date. EA SPORTS ultimate team has more than 30 million players so far this year, up 25% year-over-year. Around the world our multi-platform Sims community continues to grow and our Sims four player base on PC and console is now the largest in franchise history. Apex Legends has established itself as a top global franchise with major year-over-year growth and continued expansion opportunities. Apex in Asia is having great success with each season of content. We've just launched a game to massive Steam community and cross play is now live making it easier for people to play with friends around the world. Our esports programs are scaling the new records in viewership also. Our new Madden NFL episodic content featuring NFL athletes, celebrities and top Madden NFL players is bringing great entertainment to a much wider audience. And our recent FIFA 21 challenge, which paired esports stars with celebrity soccer players was our most watch esports event to date with viewership that place it amongst top esports broadcast worldwide. Our EA PLAY service is the most successful multi-platform subscription in the industry. With the addition of our subscription on PS4 and Steam, we've reached more than 6.5 million paid subscribers. EA PLAY is now set to go live on Microsoft Game Pass in a few days, and we believe we have the opportunity to double our subscriber base over the next 12 months. In addition to our subscription, we launched more than 125 games and content packs on Steam this year with new tiles like C&C Remastered and Star Wars: Squadrons leading the download chat on the platform. Bringing our games to Steam is a new and additive business for us. With the EA and Steam communities able to play together, we're able to harness the full opportunity in the PC space as it continues to show strong growth. We continue to lead the industry as the only developer and publisher with the ability to bring this much quality content to players. We've done this through unprecedented circumstances in the last six months and now we're delivering more great experiences in our current quarter. We started our third quarter by launching two new EA SPORTS games. When it went live globally on October 9 FIFA 21 already had a record number of players in the game through the early access benefit of our subscription. Our player metrics in FIFA 21 are strong and FIFA Ultimate Team also continues to grow with matches in the mode up 30% year-over-year. NHL 21, which includes the fan favorite NHL 94 Rewind has quickly become the most successful NHL game yet on current gen consoles. The Sims four and Apex Legends show how we build great live services into strong ongoing businesses. This quarter we'll launch our tenth expansion pack for the Sims 4 along with an important game update to add even more cultural customization options for our players. On the heels of our highly successful Season 6 we've just launched Season 7 in Apex Legends which is said to be our biggest season of content this year. We now have more than 20 top live services across console, PC and mobile forming a foundation for continued growth. We will continue to reach more players across more platforms in Q3. We have more titles launching on Switch and Google Stadia this quarter. Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond will launch on Oculus VR in December our second VR experience this year. And as I mentioned before, we will take another step in our subscription strategy this week with our expansion to Microsoft Game Pass opening significant new opportunities to grow our subscriber base. This quarter also brings the launch of next-generation consoles from our partners at Microsoft and Sony. EA SPORTS is always at the center of innovation for us and it will lead the way on next-gen consoles. FIFA 21 for PS5 and Xbox Series X will leverage the major upgrading technology to bring players unprecedented immersion, innovative gameplay and minimal load times to put them into the action in under two seconds. Madden NFL 21 for the next-gen consoles will blur the lines of sport even further through a new system that is responsive to the way NFL players perform in the real world. We're excited to have an opportunity to bring even more players into our FIFA and Madden franchises this year and we're providing a smooth transition for players on current gen consoles to move over with the next-gen upgrade. Looking ahead, I want to offer a few thoughts on our growth drivers for FY 2022 and beyond. Each previous console generation has grown in the global market and we expect this transition will be the same. We plan to launch at least six new games on the next-gen consoles in FY 2022. These will include a new Need for Speed game that is bringing some astounding visual leaps developed by the Criterion team who have launched some of the most highly rated games in franchise history. DICE is creating our next Battlefield game with never before seen scale. The technical advancements of the new consoles are allowing the team to deliver a true next-gen vision for the franchise. We have hands on play testing underway internally and the team has been getting very positive feedback on the game as we've begun to engage our community. The next Battlefield is set to launch in holiday 2021, we're excited to share a lot more about the game in the spring. Our live services are positioned to be a long-term growth driver. Having built Apex Legends into an amazing live service with a deeply engaged community, the talented Respawn team in Los Angeles has expanded Apex development to include a full team in our Vancouver location so that we can continue delivering more great content. Japan is now our second largest market for Apex Legends and we have strong plans to continue growth in that region. In addition, Apex mobile development will be complete in the New Year and ready for launch in FY 2022. We also expect another very strong year for the Sims 4 a testament to the strength of that community as it enters the seventh year of live service. EA SPORTS will be executing on a significant expansion that will span new games more geographies and more ways to engage. FIFA is growing. In addition to FIFA 21 on next-gen this year and Stadia in the new year, the success of our FIFA Online four free-to-play game in Asia now leads us to expand that game to new markets including the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Soccer continues to grow on popularity around the world and we now have six new soccer mobile games in development for new genres and new markets. Our roster of top soccer league licenses is also unmatched. Our recently extended agreements with the Bundesliga and La Liga in addition to more than 30 other league partners including UEFA Champions League, [11:22] [Indiscernible] and the Premier League enable us to continue delivering this franchise to more players around the world with the authenticity they expect. We also just announced a new multiyear -- we also just announced new multiyear agreements with our partners at the NHL, NHLPA and UFC that is creating more innovative hockey and fighting experiences. We also have plans to add our core EA SPORTS portfolio with multiple new franchises in the years ahead. In addition to our college esports expansion that we've just announced with ING Group, in the weeks ahead we'll share more about another major new development in our esports program capitalizing on our growing fan base and demand from esports teams, sponsors and broadcasters. Our business has expanded significantly this year. Our pipeline of new games and live services is robust and we're positioned well for sustained growth. A huge thank you goes to our amazing teams for their incredible spirit and dedication to our players. I am proud of how we have continued to execute. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Thanks, Blake. Games are becoming essential trait of the digital lifestyle for people around the world. With more players than ever continuing to connect and engage through our franchises, our business has grown significantly this year, and we are confident of projecting meaningful growth into FY 2022 and beyond. We hope everybody stays healthy and enjoy some great games this holiday season. And now Blake and I are here for your questions. In terms of why it makes sense for us, again our objective from the very beginning has been to ensure that players can access our subscription on any platform, in any way that makes sense for them, to the best value gaming opportunity in the marketplace. We have strong partnership with Microsoft and Sony and Steam. And of course we have our own platform with EA PLAY. And as we looked at it we saw this as an opportunity to build, an access point for our EA PLAY subscription on the Microsoft platform. We saw it as a way to give gamers easy and frictionless access. We will -- as part of that this is not just putting our games at Microsoft subscription, this is actually an entitlement to the EA PLAY subscription. And as a result of that the relationship that we have, with those players who make those subscriptions, they will be the same as if we sold it outside the platform. So you'll continue to see us think about our subscription broadly across platforms. And making it available to any player wherever they want, in any way they need, with as little friction as possible. Great question. Again, when we think about Madden and we think about FIFA for that matter, we really think about as a platform to bring the fans of these sports together to engage in interactive consumption of the sport. And 10, 15 years ago we would have had multiple games, arcade style, simulation style, management style, that we would put in the marketplace as separate packaged goods. As we've really transformed our business into the world of digital as we've moved the experience from product to service for our players, what our players have also told us is they want us to keep them together. They want to come together, regardless of what format they're engaging with. And so as we continue to develop the Madden franchise, as we continue the FIFA franchise, you should expect that we'll continue to add these new modalities of play to the product or to the service. What we've seen so far this year in Madden is there's been really good and strong engagement in The Yard. It's early \u2013 it's still early in its life cycle. But it's offering this opportunity for people to come into the franchise in a new way and play a more casual experience. If they haven't really wanted to engage in the full 11 V11 experience that he is going to buy. But it also allows our harder core players to do something a little different, a little more social and a little faster paced than the traditional Madden game. And so overall we feel like it adds a substantial element to the overall player experience both for new players and returning players. And the same has been true for Volta inside of FIFA. In the context of cosmetic sale items we'll start to experiment with that. What we've seen across the industry is when done right the purchase of cosmetics that allow you to individualize and personalize your experience and build status in that environment as you play with your friends have been really, really well received. We expect that will be no different in Madden and FIFA over time and we'll start to work with our gaming communities as to what are the right things to them? What kind of cosmetics they look like? What are most authentic and relatable to the sports that they're playing in? And what gives them the opportunity to be unique in these large growing communities? Great question. And we're really happy and excited to welcome Jeff back to the organization. He has been an EA veteran and held very senior leadership roles in the company some number of years ago, but spent the best part of the last decade in kind of mobile-first organizations and comes back to us with unbelievable experience and tremendous expertise. And we are now -- you heard me talk about six new FIFA titles. You hear us talk about the push with Apex Legends. What I would tell you is, Jeff has come back and made three core assessments. The first is that we have an existing portfolio of games that are tremendously profitable, but have significant more opportunity for engagement and monetization than we're presently doing with some changes to the organization and some changes to how we run those live services. And he's already started to work with leaders and we brought a number of new leaders from across the mobile industry into our company and they are going through each one of our franchises and looking for opportunities to deliver new content, new experiences and new services to players that will drive higher engagement and result in monetization in our existing franchises. The second thing he has done has come in and said, there are a number of key franchises like FIFA who have unbelievable exponential opportunity around the world. And he's put in motion a series of internal development and external development that will really start to execute against our big franchises like FIFA and some others that we will be able to talk about more soon. And then the third thing is, he also has a tremendous network out there in the mobile sphere. And there are a lot of great developers out there who have really great games and really great game mechanics and lot of experience and expertise, but they do not have the IP to build their games around or the marketing muscle to really drive acquisition and what is becoming an increasingly competitive market. And so Jeff is also doing a lot of outreach with external developers and publishers and looking at ways that we could partner differently with them with our slate of IP and with our marketing muscle. Either in the context of licensing or co-development or co-publishing or in some cases acquisition. And so I've not been more excited for a number of years about what I think we're going to be able to achieve in our mobile business. And again, what we know is mobile is tremendously competitive. It's somewhat unpredictable. There are a lot of games that come to app stores on an annualized basis. But we are seeing that where you build games with great teams around trusted IP that offer unbelievable experience and value to players that monetization opportunity is very, very strong. And we're confident about that going into FY 2022 with FIFA and Apex Legends and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and others. But certainly as we look out further into 2023 and 2024, we feel like we're well positioned there as well. The short answer is yes. I've been doing this for a long time now. And most of my career before I was fortunate enough to have this job I was building sports video games. And so I went through a number of consoles. And I would tell you not only do we see the market grow considerably. If you go back and look through history every console transition meaningfully grows the market and top-tier frontline sports games almost always drive a lot of that growth and benefit from the growth in player engagement as those console transitions move through and a bigger market buys into the new console generation. We think about game development in terms of kind of what can you do with a core technology level what can you do at a future level? And what can you do at a social level and as we've gone through generations, the intelligence and the believability of plays in a sports game it's had a step change in immersion and authenticity and realism each console generation. If you go back you want the history lesson PS2 was all about can you make athletes look like the real-world athlete? PS3 or the next-generation was all about can you make the moves like real athletes. The generation that we're now is can you make them remote like real athletes? And as we look at the next-generation of platforms, it's can you bring all of those together and add a level of intelligence to those players that upholds the suspense and this belief that you are in fact engaging with real athletes in a real game on a real pitch. And so I expect that we will continue to do and drive unbelievable new development in the context of the base technology that drives the game play. The second thing that you'll also see as we move through transition is modality shift how people play single player to multiplayer, multiplier to cooperative play. And you'll see us continue to do that with the power of these new platforms and how we can bring players together in new modalities of play. And you're starting to see some of those things with how we started with Volta how we've started with The Yard and you should expect that we'll continue to expand the modalities of play on new platforms. And then last and this happened as we move from offline to online. It's really the social nature of the game and how you tie the game to the real-world of sport. And you heard me talk about how we're building Madden so that there is a greater influence of what's happening in the real-world of sport on your game. But you should also imagine that we'll start to think about how do we use the technology in these new platforms, how do we use them plus the combination of the cloud to bring millions and millions of players together in a social ecosystem around the consumption of their favorite sport. And we're excited by that as much as the base technology quite frankly, because these are becoming social networks for sports fans and COVID has accelerated that for us as the consumption of sport more broadly has moved from lean to interactive and physical interaction has moved -- social interactions move from physical to digital. So as we think about the combination of the base technology that influence gameplay the different modalities of play that the new platforms will enable and the new platforms combined with the cloud to offer an expansion of the social network orientation of these games, we're really excited about the future. And you tie that into what will almost certainly be a growing marketplace. We think we have tremendous opportunity not just this year, but in many years to come. Yes. Great question. Again, if you look at our prepared remarks and the conversation we've had today, we've launched eight games and over 200 live services and season seven of Apex Legends during this time. Working from home is -- there's no doubt it's extraordinarily hard and we're doing all we can to support our teams in any way we can. There are some benefits that come from having our scale and having our organizational structure that allows us greater fluidity of our talent. We're able to move talent from project-to-project. We're able to kind of leverage our scale in the development process. And you've seen that play out this year in our ability to launch as much high-quality content as we have.  And even as of 11:00 a.m. this morning, season seven of Apex Legends is on track to be our largest launch day since the launch of the product. Steam in the first rolled out performance has been extremely strong. Our new champion edition is already a top three bestseller on Steam. We've had the most minutes watched on Twitch since the launch of the product. So another testament to just the unbelievable, inspirational capabilities of our teams and our ability to continue to deliver amazing games experiences and content in the face of these ongoing challenges.  As we think about Battlefield next year again you heard me talk about we're doing internal play testing. We're starting to go out to our community and get feedback. I was part of the product review last week. We have rallied that entire studio around the development of Battlefield specifically. We've given them an extra year of development.  You'll remember to ensure that they can in fact build a true next-gen vision around that game. DICE is one of the most talented studios on the planet and we've been able to add leadership from our EA SPORTS business and David Rutter who understands both live services and the rigor of development. We've brought in talent from across the industry who have really bolstered our belief and our confidence in our ability to launch that game next year. So lots more to come in the next couple of months.  But even in the face of challenges I think we've demonstrated an ability to launch amazing games and content. I feel really, really good about the content we're coming next year. And part of why we have the confidence in FY 2022 that we have to grow off this year which is going to be an unbelievably extraordinary record year for us is because our scale and our organizational structure and our amazing talent, our amazing people are really coming together to deliver amazing content next year. Yes. And thank you everyone for joining us and we do hope you stay safe and healthy in what appears to be a second surge of COVID in parts of the world. What I think you've earn from me today is extremely confidence in where we're at right now and where we're going for our business. We've had strength and growth in our business this year already forecasting 11% growth year-over-year for FY 2021.  We've launched great new games in content FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, The Sims all continue to be major growth drivers and we've got further expansion opportunities this year and beyond. We are excited for the upcoming console launches. New hardware has historically always grown the market and offers us another opportunity to grow FIFA and Madden franchises with our next-gen games and we're projecting continued growth in fiscal year FY 2022 and beyond with an expansion of our sports portfolio a double down in mobile extension of our live services and of course, a new Battlefield game.  So thank you for being here today. Thanks for your questions. Be well. Thank you so much."

We\u2019ve long held equality, inclusion and diversity at the center of our beliefs at Electronic Arts, and as a company, we\u2019ve made our positions clear and demonstrated with our actions that we have a long-term commitment to making a positive impact in our world.  As we\u2019ve shared previously, our business focus continues to be on our key growth drivers: delivering amazing games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and connecting more layers across more platforms and ways to play. In our first quarter of FY21, engagement was exceptionally strong across our portfolio. We launched new games, delivered incredible growth in our live services, and welcomed tens of millions of new players into the EA network since the beginning of April. This drove the biggest first quarter in EA history, with net bookings and operating cash flow both setting new records. As a result, we are raising our full-year FY21 net revenue and net bookings guidance today.  We\u2019ve seen tremendous growth over the last four months in our business and across the industry. As EA, we sit at the intersection of two fundamental secular trends that have become increasingly clear. First, social interactions in our world are moving from physical to digital, and second, the consumption of sports and entertainment is moving from linear to interactive.  We\u2019ve seen both of these trends accelerate during the COVID period. Tens of millions of new players have come into our games, and we also have many players returning to our franchises after some time away. In addition to higher engagement from our existing players, these new and returning players are now deeply engaged in our live services, establishing new play patterns and building new friendships in our games. So while there are unknowable aspects to this period of time we are in, and it may be difficult to predict the patterns of new and returning players, we expect these trends to continue during and after the pandemic. We remain committed to continuing to innovate in this space, keeping EA at the forefront of providing social interaction and interactive entertainment to a wide global audience.  I\u2019ll share a few highlights here that capture what our teams delivered for players in Q1. We launched two new games to players during the quarter - Command & Conquer Remastered, which was incredibly well-received by fans and critics and became a top- selling title on Origin and Steam, as well as Burnout Paradise Remastered on the Nintendo Switch. Our teams also delivered over 30 new content updates for our console and PC titles, including two major game expansions, as well as more than 50 updates to our mobile games. All of this, and the continued development of our upcoming titles for FY21 and beyond, was completed with our teams working from home.  Apex Legends continues its momentum as an exceptional live service, building on strong performance through the last several quarters and bringing even more players together in the game. Q1 saw the most game sessions played and highest revenue total since the launch quarter for Apex, and engagement in Season 5 reached the highest levels since our first new season of content. Creative in-game events continue to be a huge draw for our Apex community, and the most recent event, Lost Treasures, had more than 96 million hours played in the first two weeks. We\u2019re bringing Apex to players on the Switch and Steam, and we\u2019re excited to introduce cross-play later this year so more players can engage and play together with their friends.  The world has an insatiable appetite for sports, and for the experiences that EA SPORTS delivers in our games. With real world sports disrupted, EA SPORTS has become the center of the emotional connection to sports, and we\u2019ve brought millions of new, returning and existing players into their own personal sports stories through our games. Player acquisition of new and returning players in FIFA grew more than 100% year-over-year in Q1, with more than 7 million joining during the quarter. These are now among our most engaged groups of players, demonstrating commitment and longevity in our FIFA live service. FIFA in Asia grew significantly year-over-year in Q1 as well, with FIFA Online 4 now engaging nearly 30 million players to date. Madden NFL 20 also had an incredible Q1, building on what is already the biggest year ever for our Madden franchise. Player acquisition in Madden NFL grew nearly 140% year over year in Q1, and virtually every measure of Madden Ultimate Team engagement is up more than double over last year.  The Sims continues to resonate with more players around the world. The Sims 4 now has more than 30 million players life-to-date across all platforms, and daily, weekly and monthly active player totals in the game all reached record highs for a first quarter. Our Sims mobile games had an excellent Q1 as well. The creative and inclusive nature of The Sims experience on any device is truly unique in all of gaming, and we\u2019re especially proud of the way it helps players find community and express themselves during culturally challenging times.  During Q1, we also launched nearly 30 titles on the Steam platform. Bringing our games to Steam enables us to substantially grow our PC audience. Our Origin business grew 75% year-over-year as well, and by opening up the ability for Steam and Origin players to play together, we\u2019re now positioned to harness the full power of the PC community. Bringing titles to Steam is also foundational to our EA subscription service that will go live on the platform later this summer. In addition, the total number of players in our subscriptions on Origin, Xbox One and PS4 grew quarter over quarter, with new players coming into our services to experience more great games.  It was an unprecedented first quarter of growth. Looking forward, we\u2019re also seeing strong engagement in Q2. Although it is difficult to predict ongoing levels of growth in this environment, we have grown our player base during this period and added value to our network.  Our EA SPORTS live services are acting as social networks for sports fans around the world and the strength of those connections will grow as real sports seasons return. Players in our communities for The Sims, Apex, Star Wars and more are building relationships through our games, and we expect them to be with us for a long time to come.  Building on this strength, we have exciting new titles and content coming in Q2 and beyond, including Rocket Arena which we just launched with Final Strike Games. We showcased many of these new experiences in our EA Play Live broadcast in June, where our audience grew significantly year-over-year, and the trailers and videos that we debuted have been watched more than 31 million times.  We will begin launching our new EA SPORTS games starting in August. Nowhere else in the world can sports fans find the breadth and depth of interactive experiences like the ones in our EA SPORTS portfolio this year? With UFC 4 launching on August 14, we\u2019ve got something for every fight fan - an amazing roster of fighters, tremendous customization, brand new environments, and more fluid gameplay -- all making this the most authentic MMA game we\u2019ve ever created. Madden NFL 21 is then set to launch on August 28. On top of major gameplay innovation, a new campaign mode, and more of the Superstar X-Factor abilities that fans love, we\u2019re bringing creative and innovative new ways to play Madden that build on the strength of our NFL partnership. We have more people than ever before playing and connecting through FIFA, and when FIFA 21 launches on October 9, the world\u2019s leading football experience will expand with more ways to play with friends. VOLTA SQUADS and FUT Co-Op will bring new social dimensions to the game, and we\u2019re also delivering the most comprehensive update to Career Mode that we\u2019ve ever released. NHL 21 launches October 16, and we\u2019re excited about the great work from our NHL team this year, which we\u2019ll share more about soon. Then in the holiday season, EA SPORTS will also lead the way on the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Next-generation versions of FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21 will bring the next level of innovation and interactive sports experiences to fans with the launch of the new consoles. This will be a great year of new games and content for sports fans around the world.  With our cloud-based broadcasting platform for esports operating at global scale, we delivered 85% more esports broadcast content in the last four months than we did in all of calendar year 2019. Demand for our FIFA, Apex Legends and Madden esports content across major networks is unprecedented, and the great entertainment we are providing is bringing more players and viewers into new experiences with our games. We\u2019re now significantly expanding and diversifying our content for the rest of this year. Our plans are to deliver three times as many broadcasted events in FY21 over last year, spanning linear and digital broadcasts, with more athlete, celebrity and fan competitions, in addition to global esports ecosystems for Apex Legends, FIFA and Madden. We also just launched The Sims Spark\u2019d on TBS and Buzzfeed, our first-ever reality competition TV show. Seamlessly integrating entertaining player stories and gameplay, alongside weekly challenges for Sims 4 players, it\u2019s an entirely new and unique way to create competition. It shows the innovation we can bring to the esports space with our franchises, and we\u2019re very excited by the fan reaction to date.  We\u2019re also very pleased with the response to our new Star Wars: Squadrons game from Motive Studios set to launch on October 2. This is going to be the game for anyone that\u2019s ever had the fantasy of piloting a Star Wars starfighter, with a deep level of immersion built by our teams in collaboration with Disney & Lucasfilm. We\u2019re excited to add another all-new experience to the portfolio of amazing Star Wars titles we\u2019ve delivered to fans, especially one that opens up new dimensions like full VR support and cross-play.  Our business is strong and it\u2019s been an amazing start to the year. These are challenging times amidst the pandemic, and we are deeply appreciative of all that our teams are doing to continually innovate and deliver for our players \u2013 and push the boundaries of interactive entertainment every step of the way \u2013 even while working from home. We also have to thank all of our players for their support and for playing our games. We\u2019re humbled to see so many using our games and our network as a way to connect with their friends and families during this time.  There is much more to come from us at Electronic Arts in FY21. Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake. \nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher even than the unprecedented levels we had forecast in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, the Sims and our mobile titles. And, with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected more people to the games they want and to each other.  All this was reflected in our results, with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow.  I\u2019ll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, and then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business.  Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the three reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability.  EA\u2019s net revenue was $1.46 billion, compared to $1.21 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million, compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter, as well as COVID-related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million, compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and were well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the top line beat.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last twelve months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.  Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year.  Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter.  Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year, and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board, with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. The currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year.  Live services & other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we\u2019ve invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio.  FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events, for the extra week in the quarter, and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented players its most engaging event ever, and delivered its biggest season since launch. And, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users, life to date, and Q1 net bookings more than doubled year-on-year. Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio led by Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which had its best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, The Sims Free Play and more all showed growth of a similar magnitude.  Full game net bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last twelve months. Net bookings for packaged goods and for full-game digital download both almost tripled. This was primarily driven by our deep catalog.  A brief note on financial reporting before going on to guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided by our live services teams and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we\u2019re increasing the period of time over which we recognize a portion of our net revenue. This begins in second quarter, only affects GAAP revenue, and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow.  Now, turning to guidance: due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we are increasing both our net revenue and net bookings guidance for the full year.  In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We are taking a cautious view that assumes that we continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement, driven in part by continued shelter-in-place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy and by the slightly later sports launches.  There are reasons for optimism - for example, we\u2019ve added tens of millions of players to the EA Player Network since the beginning of April. FIFA alone attracted 7 million new on console during the last quarter, and more people are playing FIFA now than at this time than in any previous cycle. This is significant, in that people that have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect them to be. Nevertheless, we haven\u2019t launched a major title since the pandemic struck, so it\u2019s too early to draw general conclusions.  Our business is strong and our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economy will prove to be too cautious.  Thus, our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion, and earnings per share of $2.97. We are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion.  A note on OpEx before moving onto the business drivers. The increase from our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount, due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We\u2019re continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and, in particular, we are increasing the number of mobile titles in development.  We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.950 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And, as you build your model, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year.  For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million, and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter.  We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3, and by the later launch of Madden NFL in Q2 which we've previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live services opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting later, and FIFA moves to the beginning of Q3. With regards to live services, remember also that we focus on engagement ahead of new product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle. See the phasing we provide in our quarterly presentation on our IR website. You\u2019ll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3, and a slightly larger Q4.  As we approach six months working from home, we are finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We\u2019re excited to showcase the incredible efforts of our Madden and FIFA teams through the upcoming launches, and by the work of all of our live services teams. The shelter-in-place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for the business, as players look for safe and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely. Nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality AAA and indie titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increasing reach across platforms and geographies enables us to continue to deliver for players and investors.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew. \nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. These past few months have been unlike anything we\u2019ve ever experienced. It was an extraordinary quarter for games and for Electronic Arts.  Our business is strong. We\u2019ve just had the largest first quarter in the history of the company, with tremendous engagement from existing, new and returning players. We are well positioned to build on that strength. We will continue to deliver more amazing games and content, including new EA SPORTS titles, more groundbreaking and fun esports content, Star Wars: Squadrons launching in October, and more. We\u2019ll continue to extend and enhance the experiences in our live services on all platforms, from console to PC to mobile. And our focus on connecting more players across more platforms will continue, as we bring our subscription to Steam, integrate our games with Stadia, expand support for cross-play, and reach more platforms with our games \u2013 including the next-gen consoles coming later this year.  It\u2019s also increasingly apparent that COVID-19 could be with us for some time. Keeping all of our teams safe is our first priority. They are the true strength of Electronic Arts, and their commitment and courage during the challenges of recent months has been deeply inspiring. Not only have they continued to develop and launch games from home. Our employees have supported nearly 1,000 different charities in the last three months, including tens of thousands of hours of volunteer time. Their contributions to COVID relief efforts and racial justice organizations, along with matching funds and additional contributions from EA, have totaled more than $3 million to date. In this environment, supporting our teams, building our culture, and striving to amplify the positive impacts of play in our communities around the world has never been more important.  We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the quarters ahead. Be well and stay healthy, everyone.  Now Blake and I are here for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMarioLu: Great. Thanks for taking the question. One on FIFA and then one at Star Wars. So the first one on FIFA with it releasing now in fiscal 3Q, although it was previously announced this shift does drive fiscal 2Q guidance to come in below the street. So can you help quantify how much of the shift this caused in terms of bookings? Any other dynamics to keep in mind going forward and should we expect FIFA-22 to now be back in the normal fiscal two release quarter?\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes. It's a good question and I appreciate you asking, the entire delta is FIFA nothing else is going on. We've tried to be pretty clear about that. I don't think people have necessarily heard that but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning on, we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the two quarters. The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all event ultimate teams all event driven that means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year, as well as this year. We made a simple decision which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple extra weeks to final in what is been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do and how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is the hope is that most investors aren't focused on each quarter. They're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million and I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company. We have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious. We also mentioned today that we know there is and if anyone out there thinks there's not economic risk in the back half of the year, I'd like to know that but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call the other thing which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff; it will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us that might be six months, nine months or two years and what we also mentioned which I think is the most important component is as people rejoin or join as a new member of the social network around the game, they tend not to leave and so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just the problem for us is we've never lived through this before and none of us have you guys haven't either. So we don't have a roadmap to be able to help us be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be -- we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward and we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business. So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try to make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's both FIFA and Madden and FIFA ultimate team that are moving but other than that we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision and we made it some time ago because we announced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door and we're confident that that's where it's going to be.  Now your second question, sorry I went on too long on the first question. So I forgot your second question.\nMarioLu: That's great. I haven't asked the second one yet. That's very helpful, Blake. So the second one is on Star Wars. Can you provide some color behind the decision process regarding pricing squadrons at $40 with no additional MTX? So I do think all games are not created equal, so overall I'm surprised how the standard has been for $60 video games in the last years 15. So why go $40 all in and not free to play or just in general what are your thoughts on potentially pricing next gen titles at a higher price point of $70 instead of $60.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes and I'll have Andrew just sort of help out on this as well because it's important here for both of us. I mean we always look at the top -- the games and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scales and most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest fantasies and that's to be able to fly ex wing fighter, fly fighter and be in a dog fight and so it doesn't have the breath of some of our games but it is still an incredible game and so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on lots of games. We've differentiated pricing on things like Plants versus Zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences for example or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an ultimate or a FIFA or Madden. Andrew you want to add to that.\nAndrewWilson: Yes. I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill. And what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price point. And as you've seen from us we have games across the spectrum of pricing whether that's free to play or at $60 or $60 with an additional live service or as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day as we think about it we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations they have and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price point given the breadth of the game, very proud of what we are doing. We wanted it to be a wholly self-contained experience that was deeply immersive in that fantasy. As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill? What are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience? And we build from there as we think about this year you've seen what we've done is we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that and we set out to build this the best PlayStation Xbox one experience as we could, as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5ve and what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.\nToddJuenger: Thank you so much. And glad to hear everybody is relatively well. Can I ask if you don't mind just thinking through the changes and release dates on the sports titles, I know that was probably a production driven decision but when we're looking at the real live physical sports leagues around the world especially in the states obviously there's a lot of uncertainty about the timing and shape of their seasons this year and next. And just wondering how that maps to the release of your games and the events and the live services and how much it matters. For instance, if there was no NFL season in the fall or if it had to be stopped it in halfway through, how does that matter to your games? How should we think about that? I know it's a sort of a broad hypothetical but there's so much uncertainty there. So I guess the underlying question is how much does whatever happens those live sports affect. How we should think about and expect people to engage with and spend money in your games. And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nBlakeJorgensen: Go ahead Andrew.\nAndrewWilson: So I would just -- I would start with kind of two things. One is my sense is that we will have sports of some shape or form in the real world over time. The second thing is regardless of whether we do or we don't sports fans have an insatiable appetite for sports day in day out, week in week out, month and month out. And what you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks and what you have seen in Q1 is we've been able to fulfill that insatiable appetite for sports with our games. And there's really -- when we think about our sports games, we think about it on two vectors. One is the connection, the emotional connection, the real world of sports and all that's happening with the players and teams and leagues that you love. The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players teams and leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sport stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that and we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also dropped in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love. And I would tell you I think that we are comfortable doing that for as long as it needs to. And then to the extent those sports come back online. We believe that's a further accelerator to our business.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes and what I said in the remarks was ultimate team in the quarter was up 70%. I don't think we've ever seen a growth like that and as part of that we know for example Madden ultimate team was up over 300% and there was no sports, live sports going on at any point in time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point and I would just stress this as when people are sports fans, remember their sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sport game alone. No one plays ultimate team alone. They play with each other and that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans, if the underlying sport stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium but at the end of the day it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And sports right I mean you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next six months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, it goes just the opposite which is if you're a Star Wars fan you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars and that's why we saw the growth of Star Wars Jedi fallen order. Growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalogue of Battlefront one and Battlefront two during the quarter. It's when you are Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to this is an incredible opportunity for us, but at the same time we also understand that we don't we can't predict the future and so we're always careful of trying to predict the future. But we do see a huge opportunity. \nToddJuenger: Thank you both for that. If you don't mind just one follow-up, somebody's got to ask the M&A question maybe I'll go this quarter and just it seems more ripe than ever given your cash balance and the cash generation and the price the value of your currency. There's at least one big asset we know of that is believed to be in the market, just wondering your disposition toward the thought and the appeal of acquisition. How you are thinking through that decision given where the industry sits right now and anything you share in that thanks?\nBlakeJorgensen: I mean what I would say there is it is very rare that we don't get a chance to look at anything that's up for sale. I mean you can imagine people call us and say we're thinking about selling a business or we're thinking about selling ourselves. I mean we are a place that a lot of people want to come as a long-term home if they decide to sell the business. So we get to look at almost everything. I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you as we said you've seen in the past where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people. And we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that we were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about Titan fall and that's no offense to Titan fall, it's an amazing game and we'll maybe see a Titan fall at some point sometime down the road, but it was really about the team and it starts at the top with Vince but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was is that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being sub-scale is difficult, but at the same time as you've seen from our results. I think everybody's going to do well in the next couple of quarters in our industry. And so it might take some time but trust that we are more interested than ever because we see talent and building great new franchises is critical to the long-term growth for business.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America.\nRyanGee: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So I believe I heard you guys said ultimate team was up 70% year-over-year. I believe that's revenue. Can you remind us what that growth rate looked like going into shelter in place and here we are end of July? How it looks kind of quarter-to- date? And then I have a follow up.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes. I mean I don't know off of the top of my head remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits maybe mid double digits like between 15% and 20%. I mean we were having a strong ultimate team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcript you could probably see it. I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean this is -- this is off the charts different right. I mean it is exceptional and particularly for games like -- for games like Madden where normally the soft spot in a game like that where we really come out of the Super Bowl and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement around things like the draft and the combine and you would expect this year maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt ultimate teams. But remember, the team a couple years ago started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year.  So we were seeing super strength in both Madden base game and Madden Ultimate team coming into the quarter. And it just continued to get stronger and stronger. I think the other thing is that all the ultimate team stepped up to think about what new events could they run in a world of stay at home or work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there were no sports, but as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and fix essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar as Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down in esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content and I'll just give you a personal example. When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know because she's a massive sports fan; I know we've hit the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want. So what we've seen so far as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April -May time frame and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or to their offices, but it is still well above what we've normally seen particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sports season to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year, but remember we know we've got a lot of new people into the game; a lot of people are engaging in ultimate team in the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer term growth. But that'll ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the games. And about engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong for the next 6 or 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher, to see The Sims up 110% year-over-year. I mean that's driven by a lot of new people elapsed players coming into The Sims and we know with The Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last six years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all the content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited. So sorry a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're, we, I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent. We are conservative as you guys all know and yet at the same time we are unbelievably optimistic about the business even though we got here via a really difficult time around the world.\nRyanGee: No. That saves me from asking several questions and then getting a hard time for asking too many. So maybe I'll just finish with one question on FIFA. So the 7 million players that you guys added sequentially coming into FIFA can you shed some light on who these players are? Are they kind of casual fringe players just looking for something to fill time not spending not converting? Or are they the ones that you've seen payer conversion, ARPU in line with your legacy hardcore players that have been in there basically since FY11 playing FIFA ultimate team? Anything you can say about the new players you're reactivated.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes. It's hard to say and Andrew you can add to this. It's just early right. So you want to see a pattern over time but Andrew go ahead and jump in.\nAndrewWilson: Yes. I would say and you heard a little bit of my prepared remarks, but it is early so this 7 million is made up of lots plays, players haven't been with it for a few years and some completely new players. What I would tell you is while it is early and it is a little bit difficult to predict future behavior on these cohorts at this juncture. They are performing like some of our strongest and most engaged groups in the game. And I think that's testament to the fact that this game does facilitate this connection to friends in connection with the sport and the live service that sits within that game is now so intrinsic to the experience. And a big part of the joy that players get. And what the teams have done through this last quarter is spectacular in terms of their ability to entertain existing players, lapsed returning players and the new players. And we're seeing those groups come together and perform in the same way that our traditionally very highly engaged strong player groups have. So we're at to Blake's point, it's early. It's not easy to predict but the early signs are very strong. And we're very optimistic about what this means for the FIFA community long term.\nOperator: The next question -- he's already in queue. Mr. Michael Ng.\nMichaelNg: Hey. Thank you very much for the question. I just have two. The first is I was wondering if you could just expand on your capital allocation plans which you put on pause at least with the buyback last quarter. Do you have plans to authorize a new buyback? And then the second question is could you talk a little bit about how the 7 million additional players that you added sequentially on FIFA informs your expectation for FIFA -21unit sales this year? Is it clear that should be up year-over-year from a unit's perspective because of the enlarged player base? Thank you.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes. I mean we're always assuming that if we bring new players in we can most likely increase the player base. And the future purchases. I would say right now as you can see we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA two weeks and that's as a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our forecast either way. It's just still too -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA Madden hockey, are all hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those. On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time it was -- we didn't pause it. I'm sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program and we felt like it was not the right time to send a message both externally, as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program. And so we got through this pandemic and had a little better feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there's commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There are only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12- months. We know that we should be returning some of that locked on a large portion of the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future. I just can't predict exactly what's going to happen.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, guys. It's Matt on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. So can you talk a little bit about the difference in behavior, if any that you're seeing between your users in the US and Europe? I know we spent a lot of time in the Q&A talking about potential phasing and how it's kind of obviously really hard to tell the sort of retention and behavior you're going to see on players at this stage. But to some extent some many European countries are a little bit ahead of North America in terms of where they are in reopening post COVID. So are you seeing a marked difference in the behavior of those users? Are they dropping off more? And one of your competitors talked last week about seeing weakness in Europe relative to the US. And is that something that is consistent with what you're seeing. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes. What I would say is one just -- I'll let Andrew jump in here but trends are, if you see a trend for a week you should be really careful because it may not be a trend for three or four weeks. And the European economies are all going through very different swings. Spain's obviously going through another jump in COVID cases and so you want to be really careful. Also every game is different, so the trends in FIFA aren't going to necessarily match the trends in whoever the competitor was that they said was slowing or versus any other game. So I'll let Andrew jump in. He was going to say something it sounds like.\nAndrewWilson: No. I would just say I would echo Blake's comment. I would also point to the performance of FIFA through our last quarter. And we saw tremendous engagement through the quarter. And I think Blake spoke to kind of a peak and that we -- we've seen some change in that, but the engagement through FIFA and our other games has been very, very strong throughout the entire quarter and continues even now to be much, much stronger than it would be typically at this time of the year. And so to Blake's point, I think, it's too early to tell what we have seen in our games is continued strong engagement. And we believe that that's because we are providing particularly the relations to FIFA in Europe that emotional connection to football that was missing and what we saw is football came back online at least somewhat in Europe is that further bolstered that emotional connection to the sport that our FIFA game was able to provide. So too early to tell but we've seen continued strong engagement even in Europe as they've -- as some of those markets have gone back online.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thank you and then just on the topic of working from home, obviously, we're much farther in now to the process of everyone getting up the curve of learning how to operate in this environment. Have you learned anything new? Are there any changes the way that you guys are thinking about having your workforce working from home any new challenges? I know there were some public comments from some people that respond that maybe there were some challenges that they hadn't anticipated with Apex. Just any thoughts you have there. Thank you.\nAndrewWilson: Yes. I would -- again, we're all, I mean, everybody on this call is working from home and there are many great benefits to working from home as it turns out. We've cut down our commute time tremendously. We don't travel as much. So we have the opportunity to spend more time with our families and in some cases, I think, we are significantly more productive in a work from home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging, the mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in one place. I think as an organization we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible. And often offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there are a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce was work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that comes from putting creative people together in a building at least for some part of the time. And again, we are -- we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely, in all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers is that we'll be most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year at which point we'll reevaluate. And we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees and to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer term changes that we might make. We're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now. So not much to share at this point in terms of long-term changes other than there will likely be some. But those some probably won't involve the entire workforce staying work from home forever.\nBlakeJorgensen: Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that is I just -- I remind people to go back and on net bookings our live services with $1.103 billion, up $416 million from prior year. Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services and live services are require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization that is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live services growth like we have. I mean Andrew and I every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because then once again as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run lives, how do you run ultimate team or Apex from home. No one's ever done it and it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over indexing on us moving FIFA out of second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think what we're trying to send the signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for via the COVID virus but we've proven that this is something that's really special. So with that I'll end the call and look forward to seeing everyone or talking to everyone in person maybe someday soon or maybe a year from now who knows. But we appreciate everybody's interest and time. And I know it's a busy day of earnings. So it's tough for teams. But thank you guys for your good questions as always and listening. And we'll talk to you next quarter.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you. Be well. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and now disconnect.",

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We saw extraordinary levels of player engagement through the first quarter, far higher even than the unprecedented levels we had forecast in May. And it proved more resilient than we had expected. Engagement was broad-based, with net bookings for live services at extraordinary levels for FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, the Sims and our mobile titles. And, with increased sales of our games across the breadth of our entire catalog, we connected more people to the games they want and to each other.  All this was reflected in our results, with record Q1 highs in net revenue, net bookings, live services and cash flow.  I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, and then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business.  Before I get to the numbers, let me remind everyone of the three reporting changes we implemented this quarter and discussed in our last quarter call. First, we now present GAAP net revenue in the income statement as one item, rather than as product and service. Second, we report mobile bookings gross of platform fees, instead of net. And finally, we updated the presentation of net bookings by composition to focus on full game and live services sales. Our historical results have been recast for comparability.  EA's net revenue was $1.46 billion, compared to $1.21 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $239 million. Operating expenses were $700 million, compared to $607 million a year ago. This was above our expectations, driven by variable compensation due to our strong performance in the quarter, as well as COVID-related costs and lower attrition. Operating income was $471 million, compared to $415 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share were $1.25 and were well above our expectations of $0.93, driven by the top line beat.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $378 million, up $220 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $340 million. Operating cash flow for the last twelve months was $2.02 billion, a new record. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.  Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.96 billion, up 15% year-on-year.  Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter.  Net bookings for the quarter were $1.39 billion, up $608 million from the prior year, and $390 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board, with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. The currency headwind net of hedges was $42 million year-on-year.  Live services & other net bookings were $1.103 billion, up $416 million from the prior year. This extraordinary result is a consequence of the years of work we've invested in building teams, processes and content for our titles, which delivered strength across our portfolio.  FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, and The Sims all grew very strongly. Ultimate Team was up 70% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the timing of Ultimate Team events, for the extra week in the quarter, and for currency. With Lost Treasures, Apex Legends presented players its most engaging event ever, and delivered its biggest season since launch. And, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 exceeded 30 million users, life to date, and Q1 net bookings more than doubled year-on-year. Mobile was up 32%, with success across our portfolio led by Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which had its best quarter since 2018. The game has now generated over $1 billion in lifetime bookings. FIFA Mobile, SimCity, The Sims Free Play and more all showed growth of a similar magnitude.  Full game net bookings were $287 million, up $192 million from the prior year. 52% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last twelve months. Net bookings for packaged goods and for full-game digital download both almost tripled. This was primarily driven by our deep catalog.  A brief note on financial reporting before going on to guidance. People are playing our games for longer as a result of the amazing content provided by our live services teams and the social connections they make within our games. So for GAAP reporting, we're increasing the period of time over which we recognize a portion of our net revenue. This begins in second quarter, only affects GAAP revenue, and only affects the timing of recognition, not total net revenue. We estimate that it will move the recognition of approximately $300 million in GAAP net revenue from fiscal 2021 into fiscal 2022. It does not affect net bookings or operating cash flow.  Now, turning to guidance: due to the significant outperformance during the quarter, we are increasing both our net revenue and net bookings guidance for the full year.  In doing so, we had to balance the significant boost we saw in Q1 and the confidence we have in our games and live services against the unknowable macroeconomic environment for the rest of the fiscal year. We are taking a cautious view that assumes that we continue to see a modest tailwind to engagement, driven in part by continued shelter-in-place orders. This is offset by a weaker economy and by the slightly later sports launches.  There are reasons for optimism - for example, we've added tens of millions of players to the EA Player Network since the beginning of April. FIFA alone attracted 7 million new on console during the last quarter, and more people are playing FIFA now than at this time than in any previous cycle. This is significant, in that people that have played the game recently are more likely to buy the new one. New players are building networks of friends in our games as they play. Engagement in FIFA and Madden continue to be massively above where we would normally expect them to be. Nevertheless, we haven't launched a major title since the pandemic struck, so it's too early to draw general conclusions.  Our business is strong and our games are on track. Hopefully, our base case around the uncertain economy will prove to be too cautious.  Thus, our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is now $5.625 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.483 billion, and earnings per share of $2.97. We are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $275 million to $1.85 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.725 billion.  A note on OpEx before moving onto the business drivers. The increase from our prior guidance is mainly driven by variable compensation plus higher-than-expected headcount, due to lower turnover during this difficult period. We're continuing to invest in our growth drivers, and, in particular, we are increasing the number of mobile titles in development.  We now expect net bookings for the year to be $5.950 billion, $400 million above our prior guidance. Versus last year, this factors in an FX headwind of about $100 million. And, as you build your model, note that we are also forecasting a fall in interest income of about $80 million compared to last year.  For the second quarter, we now expect GAAP net revenue of $1.125 billion, cost of revenue to be $280 million, and operating expenses of $755 million. This results in earnings per share of $0.21 for the second quarter.  We anticipate net bookings for the second quarter to be $875 million. The significant year-on-year variance is driven by the move of FIFA 21 from Q2 to Q3, and by the later launch of Madden NFL in Q2 which we've previously announced. The change in mix for Q2 weighs on gross margin for the quarter. Madden stays in Q2, but has less live services opportunity than in prior years by virtue of starting later, and FIFA moves to the beginning of Q3. With regards to live services, remember also that we focus on engagement ahead of new product launches, so expect lower bookings at that point of the cycle. See the phasing we provide in our quarterly presentation on our IR website. You'll see that the smaller Q2 is more than offset by a much larger Q3, and a slightly larger Q4.  As we approach six months working from home, we are finding ways to continue to deliver great games and services. We're excited to showcase the incredible efforts of our Madden and FIFA teams through the upcoming launches, and by the work of all of our live services teams. The shelter-in-place orders have so far been a strong tailwind for the business, as players look for safe and social entertainment in these difficult times. A macroeconomic headwind in the second half seems very likely. Nevertheless, our ability to deliver high quality AAA and indie titles for our players, combined with the incredible success of our ongoing live services and increasing reach across platforms and geographies enables us to continue to deliver for players and investors.  Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Yes. It's a good question and I appreciate you asking, the entire delta is FIFA nothing else is going on. We've tried to be pretty clear about that. I don't think people have necessarily heard that but that's the entire delta. We've also not changed the back half of the year guidance down. So you should assume we are planning on, we will make up anything we might have missed during the quarter or the two quarters. The other thing I would just want to remind people is that it's all event ultimate teams all event driven that means that there may be some events that roll into next year, which actually strengthen next year, as well as this year. We made a simple decision which is we wanted to give both the FIFA and Madden team a couple extra weeks to final in what is been the most difficult situation we've ever lived through, which is building games from home. We are incredibly impressed with what they've been able to do and how they've been able to innovate the game within this context. And so our view is the hope is that most investors aren't focused on each quarter. They're focused on the full year. We just raised guidance by $400 million and I remind people in the history of both Andrew and I running the company. We have only raised guidance in the first quarter once. So you guys all know our conservative approach and how we're always cautious. We also mentioned today that we know there is and if anyone out there thinks there's not economic risk in the back half of the year, I'd like to know that but we all know there's economic risk. And so I think I would take our raising of guidance and not lowering guidance in the back half of the year even after moving FIFA and Madden is a pretty positive signal. And I think Andrew and I both mentioned in the call the other thing which was we are continuing to see engagement and monetization levels higher than we've normally seen during where we currently are in the second quarter. And I'm not telling you that that's going to change the second quarter or we would have changed guidance because we just don't know yet. But remember the unbelievably high monetization we saw in Q1 does not drop off a cliff; it will slowly decline as we all go back to a normal life. But if you ask many of us that might be six months, nine months or two years and what we also mentioned which I think is the most important component is as people rejoin or join as a new member of the social network around the game, they tend not to leave and so this should ultimately long-term benefit our business. And it's just the problem for us is we've never lived through this before and none of us have you guys haven't either. So we don't have a roadmap to be able to help us be able to predict exactly what it's going to look like. And so we're trying to be -- we're trying to be transparent. We're trying to be straightforward and we're trying to be optimistic because we are optimistic but we're also trying to be realistic that we know that there's economic strains out there around the world that could ultimately come back to impact our business or anybody's business. So sorry to go on about the question, but I think we want to try to make sure we're -- people are understanding that it's both FIFA and Madden and FIFA ultimate team that are moving but other than that we're not signaling anything else other than we made a decision and we made it some time ago because we announced it some time ago. So we wanted to give the teams a few extra weeks to make sure that the product was exceptional when it came out the door and we're confident that that's where it's going to be.  Now your second question, sorry I went on too long on the first question. So I forgot your second question. Yes and I'll have Andrew just sort of help out on this as well because it's important here for both of us. I mean we always look at the top -- the games and we want to make sure we are providing the greatest value for our players. And games all have different scales and most of our games right now have huge scale. We designed this game to really focus on what we heard from consumers, which is one of their greatest fantasies and that's to be able to fly ex wing fighter, fly fighter and be in a dog fight and so it doesn't have the breath of some of our games but it is still an incredible game and so that's why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy. I'll let Andrew jump in and talk about how we view pricing long term. But I think you've seen us over the years differentiate pricing on lots of games. We've differentiated pricing on things like Plants versus Zombies games because we knew that they were skewed to younger audiences for example or maybe didn't have the depth of all of the game modes that you might see in an ultimate or a FIFA or Madden. Andrew you want to add to that. Go ahead Andrew. Yes and what I said in the remarks was ultimate team in the quarter was up 70%. I don't think we've ever seen a growth like that and as part of that we know for example Madden ultimate team was up over 300% and there was no sports, live sports going on at any point in time during that quarter. And I think Andrew made the point and I would just stress this as when people are sports fans, remember their sports fans connected to a social network. No one plays a fantasy sport game alone. No one plays ultimate team alone. They play with each other and that means that it builds off of the social network more than anything else. And so in the absence of sports people double down and are excited. And so while we always want live sports to go on because it helps feed the engagement and excitement around the business. We also know sports fans are not going to stop being sports fans, if the underlying sport stops. And I think the first quarter proves that better than anything we've ever seen. And so we hope sports is back because we all love sports and we want to engage in it. I'd prefer not to watch sports with an empty stadium but at the end of the day it's better than no sports at all. And our games allow people that continued engagement with something that they really love. And sports right I mean you might ask, well, if there's no Star Wars content in the next six months because movie studios are shut down or TV studios are shut down, does that hurt your business? No, it goes just the opposite which is if you're a Star Wars fan you want to find every single opportunity to engage in Star Wars and that's why we saw the growth of Star Wars Jedi fallen order. Growth of our Star Wars online business and continued growth of the catalogue of Battlefront one and Battlefront two during the quarter. It's when you are Star Wars fan, you want Star Wars and you got to get it somewhere. So that's why we keep coming back to this is an incredible opportunity for us, but at the same time we also understand that we don't we can't predict the future and so we're always careful of trying to predict the future. But we do see a huge opportunity. I mean what I would say there is it is very rare that we don't get a chance to look at anything that's up for sale. I mean you can imagine people call us and say we're thinking about selling a business or we're thinking about selling ourselves. I mean we are a place that a lot of people want to come as a long-term home if they decide to sell the business. So we get to look at almost everything. I can't comment on any specific acquisition other than what I will tell you as we said you've seen in the past where we've done the best is where we have long-term relationships with people. And we're really trying to buy great talent versus games. And I think Respawn is a classic example of that we were able to bring them into the fold, give them incredible support and it was all driven by the fact that they had incredible talent. It wasn't about Titan fall and that's no offense to Titan fall, it's an amazing game and we'll maybe see a Titan fall at some point sometime down the road, but it was really about the team and it starts at the top with Vince but it goes all the way through the whole organization. So we're always looking at that. We'll always continue to look at that. We would hope we can find more. Our hope was is that some of the challenges in our broad world economy would actually make people think and understand that being sub-scale is difficult, but at the same time as you've seen from our results. I think everybody's going to do well in the next couple of quarters in our industry. And so it might take some time but trust that we are more interested than ever because we see talent and building great new franchises is critical to the long-term growth for business. Yes. I mean I don't know off of the top of my head remember, but I think we were bouncing between high single digits and low double digits maybe mid double digits like between 15% and 20%. I mean we were having a strong ultimate team quarter. If you go to the fourth quarter, if you go back and look at the transcript you could probably see it. I just don't have it in front of me. But I mean this is -- this is off the charts different right. I mean it is exceptional and particularly for games like -- for games like Madden where normally the soft spot in a game like that where we really come out of the Super Bowl and there's only a few places where you can kind of continue to drive engagement around things like the draft and the combine and you would expect this year maybe because many of those things were not done in person that might have hurt ultimate teams. But remember, the team a couple years ago started working on changing and adding new modes to the game and improving, and it really came to play in the past year.  So we were seeing super strength in both Madden base game and Madden Ultimate team coming into the quarter. And it just continued to get stronger and stronger. I think the other thing is that all the ultimate team stepped up to think about what new events could they run in a world of stay at home or work from home or whatever it might be. And so they doubled down on social and really drove opportunities in a world in which there were no sports, but as I said in the last question, sports fans were looking for their sports excitement and fix essentially to be able to play. And so you saw that in our esports calendar as Andrew mentioned, we completely doubled down in esports even though we had to do it all from a virtual broadcasting facility versus our own broadcasting facility. And our team did an amazing job of creating some incredible content and I'll just give you a personal example. When I see my wife watching a Madden esports tournament and cheering on TV, I know because she's a massive sports fan; I know we've hit the right tone with consumers. We're delivering for consumers what they want. So what we've seen so far as I mentioned on the call earlier, we saw this peak of massive engagement in the April -May time frame and that slowly declined as some people have gone back to work or to their offices, but it is still well above what we've normally seen particularly at this time of the year, which is the slowest time as we move from one sports season to the next. And I can't tell you how that's going to look for the rest of the quarter or for the rest of the year, but remember we know we've got a lot of new people into the game; a lot of people are engaging in ultimate team in the sports franchises. And we don't think that shuts off overnight and maybe never shuts off. And we hope that will give us longer term growth. But that'll ultimately be a question when we start talking about next year's guidance and all those things that we normally do. But don't take our conservatism in any way on guidance going forward as saying anything about the games. And about engagement, it's all about the economy at the end of the day. And you guys tell me, you saw the GDP numbers this morning. Are you confident the economy is going to be strong for the next 6 or 12 months? I just don't know. That's the thing that weighs on us the most. And yet at the same time, we know that the engagement in our games has never been higher, to see The Sims up 110% year-over-year. I mean that's driven by a lot of new people elapsed players coming into The Sims and we know with The Sims, remember, it's grown every year for the last six years. That means that people who come in don't churn out. They get engaged and then they continue to engage in all the content that's been produced and the new content. And that's where we get pretty excited. So sorry a bigger answer to your question than you probably wanted, but we're, we, I want to make sure everyone understands. We are prudent. We are conservative as you guys all know and yet at the same time we are unbelievably optimistic about the business even though we got here via a really difficult time around the world. Yes. It's hard to say and Andrew you can add to this. It's just early right. So you want to see a pattern over time but Andrew go ahead and jump in. Yes. I mean we're always assuming that if we bring new players in we can most likely increase the player base. And the future purchases. I would say right now as you can see we didn't take our guidance down for the back half of the year. We simply moved FIFA two weeks and that's as a quarterly change. So I wouldn't take any of that as a message that we have moved or changed our forecast either way. It's just still too -- it's still too early to say on that. And so more to come I think by the time we get to our second quarter earnings we'll have a much better sense of do we think guidance is going to go up or down based on where both FIFA Madden hockey, are all hockey and UFC are tracking. But we're very optimistic about all those. On capital allocation, we paused our program because we felt like at the time it was -- we didn't pause it. I'm sorry, we didn't restart a new program because we were at the end of our old program and we felt like it was not the right time to send a message both externally, as well as internally into our company that we were starting a new program. And so we got through this pandemic and had a little better feeling about how things would look in the future. And I think we're closer now. I can't tell you when we would restart a program. There is no doubt that there's commitment to have a program. It's really a timing issue and it's a timing issue driven by the COVID situation. And I think that's pretty consistent with almost every company out there. There are only a couple of companies that have started new programs in the last quarter. And so that's the answer. There's no change in our thinking. We believe we want to effectively and always be returning capital to shareholders. As you saw we had the greatest cash flow we've ever had as a company over the last 12- months. We know that we should be returning some of that locked on a large portion of the shareholders. And so expect you'll hear something from us in the future. I just can't predict exactly what's going to happen. Yes. What I would say is one just -- I'll let Andrew jump in here but trends are, if you see a trend for a week you should be really careful because it may not be a trend for three or four weeks. And the European economies are all going through very different swings. Spain's obviously going through another jump in COVID cases and so you want to be really careful. Also every game is different, so the trends in FIFA aren't going to necessarily match the trends in whoever the competitor was that they said was slowing or versus any other game. So I'll let Andrew jump in. He was going to say something it sounds like. Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that is I just -- I remind people to go back and on net bookings our live services with $1.103 billion, up $416 million from prior year. Most of our revenue for the quarter was live services and live services are require people to be doing something every single day. We're running events every week. We're developing new characters. We're developing new content. We're changing things. We're managing security, managing monetization that is as hard as game development is the fact that we have proven in the quarter that we could show live services growth like we have. I mean Andrew and I every morning wake up and realize we are unbelievably blessed with an incredible workforce that has figured out how to do this. Because then once again as I said earlier, there's no playbook that how do you run lives, how do you run ultimate team or Apex from home. No one's ever done it and it just shows the strength of this organization and the commitment that people have to drive the business in ways that they've never thought they could. And that's pretty powerful. And so for anybody who's over indexing on us moving FIFA out of second quarter to third quarter, I just suggest go back and just think about $1.1 billion in live services in the quarter. That is amazing. And so that's why I think what we're trying to send the signal to people is we don't like the fact that we had to get here for via the COVID virus but we've proven that this is something that's really special. So with that I'll end the call and look forward to seeing everyone or talking to everyone in person maybe someday soon or maybe a year from now who knows. But we appreciate everybody's interest and time. And I know it's a busy day of earnings. So it's tough for teams. But thank you guys for your good questions as always and listening. And we'll talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Blake. These past few months have been unlike anything we've ever experienced. It was an extraordinary quarter for games and for Electronic Arts.  Our business is strong. We've just had the largest first quarter in the history of the company, with tremendous engagement from existing, new and returning players. We are well positioned to build on that strength. We will continue to deliver more amazing games and content, including new EA SPORTS titles, more groundbreaking and fun esports content, Star Wars: Squadrons launching in October, and more. We'll continue to extend and enhance the experiences in our live services on all platforms, from console to PC to mobile. And our focus on connecting more players across more platforms will continue, as we bring our subscription to Steam, integrate our games with Stadia, expand support for cross-play, and reach more platforms with our games \u2013 including the next-gen consoles coming later this year.  It's also increasingly apparent that COVID-19 could be with us for some time. Keeping all of our teams safe is our first priority. They are the true strength of Electronic Arts, and their commitment and courage during the challenges of recent months has been deeply inspiring. Not only have they continued to develop and launch games from home. Our employees have supported nearly 1,000 different charities in the last three months, including tens of thousands of hours of volunteer time. Their contributions to COVID relief efforts and racial justice organizations, along with matching funds and additional contributions from EA, have totaled more than $3 million to date. In this environment, supporting our teams, building our culture, and striving to amplify the positive impacts of play in our communities around the world has never been more important.  We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the quarters ahead. Be well and stay healthy, everyone.  Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Yes. I would start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill. And what are the expectations of those player groups in fulfillment of those motivations. And I think that we start there long before we ever get to price point. And as you've seen from us we have games across the spectrum of pricing whether that's free to play or at $60 or $60 with an additional live service or as part of our subscription offerings. And at the end of the day as we think about it we start with a player, we start with the motivations and expectations they have and we build out the game. In this case, this is a very deep and immersive game and that $40 felt like the right price point given the breadth of the game, very proud of what we are doing. We wanted it to be a wholly self-contained experience that was deeply immersive in that fantasy. As we think about pricing more broadly, I would come back to that position which is we start with what are the player motivations we're trying to fulfill? What are the expectations that players have around depth and breadth and live service in any given experience? And we build from there as we think about this year you've seen what we've done is we've announced that we will offer the ability for players to transition free of charge from existing generation of console titles to the next generation of console titles for FIFA and Madden. We did that and we set out to build this the best PlayStation Xbox one experience as we could, as well as the most innovative and creative experiences for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5ve and what we wanted for our players this year because what they asked for was the smoothest possible transition that meant that they could jump into the game when it launched on existing platforms and then move into the next platform as it made sense for them later on in the year. And that has been our focus this year. And we will continue to kind of look at this over time. So I would just -- I would start with kind of two things. One is my sense is that we will have sports of some shape or form in the real world over time. The second thing is regardless of whether we do or we don't sports fans have an insatiable appetite for sports day in day out, week in week out, month and month out. And what you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks and what you have seen in Q1 is we've been able to fulfill that insatiable appetite for sports with our games. And there's really -- when we think about our sports games, we think about it on two vectors. One is the connection, the emotional connection, the real world of sports and all that's happening with the players and teams and leagues that you love. The other is we provide you a tool set that features those players teams and leagues that you love, but allows you to tell your own personal sport stories. And what you saw from us this past quarter is we really leaned into that and we actually augmented that some. So while we provided opportunities and events so that you might tell your own personal sports stories with your friends and your rivals, we also dropped in about additional esports content, celebrity content and esports and celebrity competitions. And what we've seen is that we've been able to uphold and fulfill the motivations of sports fans and the needs of sports fans and allow them to remain connected to the sports they love. And I would tell you I think that we are comfortable doing that for as long as it needs to. And then to the extent those sports come back online. We believe that's a further accelerator to our business. Yes. I would say and you heard a little bit of my prepared remarks, but it is early so this 7 million is made up of lots plays, players haven't been with it for a few years and some completely new players. What I would tell you is while it is early and it is a little bit difficult to predict future behavior on these cohorts at this juncture. They are performing like some of our strongest and most engaged groups in the game. And I think that's testament to the fact that this game does facilitate this connection to friends in connection with the sport and the live service that sits within that game is now so intrinsic to the experience. And a big part of the joy that players get. And what the teams have done through this last quarter is spectacular in terms of their ability to entertain existing players, lapsed returning players and the new players. And we're seeing those groups come together and perform in the same way that our traditionally very highly engaged strong player groups have. So we're at to Blake's point, it's early. It's not easy to predict but the early signs are very strong. And we're very optimistic about what this means for the FIFA community long term. No. I would just say I would echo Blake's comment. I would also point to the performance of FIFA through our last quarter. And we saw tremendous engagement through the quarter. And I think Blake spoke to kind of a peak and that we -- we've seen some change in that, but the engagement through FIFA and our other games has been very, very strong throughout the entire quarter and continues even now to be much, much stronger than it would be typically at this time of the year. And so to Blake's point, I think, it's too early to tell what we have seen in our games is continued strong engagement. And we believe that that's because we are providing particularly the relations to FIFA in Europe that emotional connection to football that was missing and what we saw is football came back online at least somewhat in Europe is that further bolstered that emotional connection to the sport that our FIFA game was able to provide. So too early to tell but we've seen continued strong engagement even in Europe as they've -- as some of those markets have gone back online. Yes. I would -- again, we're all, I mean, everybody on this call is working from home and there are many great benefits to working from home as it turns out. We've cut down our commute time tremendously. We don't travel as much. So we have the opportunity to spend more time with our families and in some cases, I think, we are significantly more productive in a work from home environment as it relates to our efficiency levels. At the same time, I think we would all acknowledge that there are other components of work from home that are very challenging. Home schooling is challenging, the mental and emotional well-being can be challenged if you're spending all your time in one place. I think as an organization we've remained committed to our employees. We are providing financial assistance, mental and physical and emotional assistance. We're offering flexibility in work hours wherever possible. And often offering caregiver leave as members of our employee base think about home schooling or caring for family and loved ones. I think there are a lot of things that we've learned. I don't think we'll ever go back exactly to the way things were. But at the same time, I don't think we would ever move to a place where the entire workforce was work from home. I do believe there is a kinetic energy that comes from putting creative people together in a building at least for some part of the time. And again, we are -- we're just a few months into this. As I said in my prepared remarks, we will likely, in all likelihood and what we've communicated to employers is that we'll be most of us will be work from home through the rest of this calendar year at which point we'll reevaluate. And we are being very open in our dialogue and communication with employees and to the extent that there are things that we can do to help them through this process or to the extent that there might be longer term changes that we might make. We're opening up that dialogue and having those conversations now. So not much to share at this point in terms of long-term changes other than there will likely be some. But those some probably won't involve the entire workforce staying work from home forever. Thank you. Be well."

I hope all of you are well. I want to start by thanking our incredible teams at Electronic Arts. We have the most talented people in the industry who, every day, demonstrate passion, creativity, and determination. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to Chris Suh. Chris joined us in March as our new Chief Financial Officer. He is an exceptionally qualified leader, and I am looking forward to our partnership as we drive our next phase of growth. EA delivered profitable growth in FY '22, a record year in every important measure of our business. Total players, engagement in our games and live services, net bookings, and underlying profit. We grew our global network of players to more than 580 million unique active accounts, fueled by new players joining titles including EA SPORTS FIFA, Apex Legends and The Sims, and new players that we welcomed from our acquisitions. The strength of our broad IP portfolio, our creative talent together with highly re-occurring revenue streams continues to super-charge growth in our business. We delivered $7.515 billion in net bookings and underlying profit grew more than 20%. It was a record year, and our talented teams rose to the challenge in a big way, to inspire and entertain hundreds of millions of engaged players worldwide. Games are now central to people's lives, and younger audiences have more power as consumers. Gen Alpha, Gen Z and Millennials are digital natives and they are gaming-first generations. They see gaming as their number one choice for entertainment. The consumption of entertainment and sport is deeply social, with players across our network using games to stay connected to friends, and to express themselves. The future of entertainment is interactive, and we derive strength from three structural advantages: our IP; our incredible talent; and our growing network of players deeply engaged in our live services. First, our IP. Everything begins with amazing games, and we continue to invest in one of the most powerful IP portfolios in all of entertainment. Apex Legends will expand in every dimension, going from strength to strength. New gameplay is coming to the console and PC live service; our new mobile service launches globally this month; and the grand finale of the 2022 Apex Legends Global Series for esports is in July. EA SPORTS & Racing is set to grow significantly in FY '23. We have six new EA SPORTS titles this year, with more in development Our pipeline for this year and future years features big, beloved IP that we cannot wait for players to experience including Need for Speed, Dead Space, Star Wars, The Sims, Skate, our Bioware franchises, and Lord of the Rings. Our two new studios in Seattle are working on new projects, our Motive studio has an unannounced title in development, and we have more underway across our global studio teams. Next, we have the best talent in the world. Making amazing games starts with incredible game makers. Innovating across our business, our people make Electronic Arts a great place to work from delivering safe and secure platforms, to telling exciting stories and developing our next generation of creators. We are a collective team of leaders who together deliver one of the broadest portfolios in the industry every year, while continuing to pioneer new experiences. We are proud of our distinctive talent from across the many parts of EA for continuing to deliver more exceptional games and content at scale. Finally, we have a large growing network of players deeply engaged in live services. To provide a sense of scale, we had more daily, weekly, and monthly active players across our entire portfolio. FIFA Mobile recorded its biggest quarter ever, with unique new players surging nearly 80% year-over-year, and Apex Legends is amongst the top live service games in the industry. As we look ahead, we are investing in ways for fans to have amazing, shared experiences together, whether that\u2019s by playing, watching or creating. Through our console, PC, and mobile live services; through esports; through other original content; and with tools that unleash the creativity of our players, we will grow what are already some of the world's largest and most engaged entertainment communities. Earlier today we announced that starting next fiscal year, our football experiences will move under a new EA SPORTS FC brand. This is such an exciting moment for us and our fans. We've just had our biggest year ever for EA SPORTS FIFA games, building on nearly 30 years of connected experiences for players across more than 150 million unique accounts. With more than 300 license partners, 30 leagues and federations, 700 teams, and 19,000 athletes, the future of global football is huge. We're excited to grow EA SPORTS FC. It will be the only place that fans can play in the UEFA Champions League, CONMEBOL Libertadores, the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, LaLiga, MLS and many others. Our global football franchise has long been at the forefront of innovation. From the first isometric playing angles, to online play, Ultimate Team and Women's Teams, the first narrative story mode with The Journey, to VOLTA, to Hypermotion, we have repeatedly delivered new ways to play the game. We're thankful for many great years of partnership with FIFA, and we are looking forward to delivering another full EA SPORTS FIFA game later this year, filled with great features and World Cup content. Then, the new era begins next year with EA SPORTS FC. With a total addressable market of more than 3.5 billion football and soccer fans worldwide, EA SPORTS FC will be the authentic, inclusive, and immersive global entertainment property at the epicenter of football fandom. We have amazing games, we've built around powerful IP, made by incredibly talented teams. We have a network of more than half a billion player accounts. We have outstanding engagement in our games and live services, fueled by social connection and shared experiences. With these strengths at our core, FY '23 is set to be a year of innovation, growth, and leadership for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand the call over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Andrew and good afternoon everyone. As Andrew said, FY '22 was a record year, with net bookings that exceeded $7.5 billion. This is more than $200 million ahead of original guidance, driven by growing player engagement across our broad portfolio of live services and games. We grew both net bookings and underlying profit by over 20% for the full year. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.9 billion, nearly $150 million above our original guidance, and we returned almost $1.5 billion to shareholders. These results speak to the power of our diverse portfolio, and to the durability and consistency of a live services business founded on deep player engagement. For the fourth quarter, net bookings were $1.75 billion, up 18% from the prior year, and reaching a new Q4 high, even with the action we took to cease sales in Russia and Belarus during the quarter. Live services net bookings grew 14% year-over-year. We delivered Q4 net revenue of over $1.8 billion, ahead of our expectations and up 36% year-over-year. Underlying profit was well above our expectations. Q4 operating expenses came in lower than our expectations, driven by the timing of some marketing and sales activities. We are continuing to prioritize our investments into our best long-term growth opportunities, while also remaining agile to realize cost savings and implement efficiencies where appropriate. We generated $444 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, and returned a further $373 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, let me talk about our full year performance. Live services net bookings grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $5.4 billion, and made up over 71% of our total business. Full game sales were up 34% to $2.1 billion. Our healthy live services growth was driven by strength across our broad-based portfolio, mostly notably by Apex Legends and FIFA. Apex Legends is up over 40% for the year, taking it past the $2 billion milestone in lifetime net bookings. Season 12 finished yesterday, and was the most successful ever. And, of course, Apex Legends Mobile is performing well in tests and is close to launch. FIFA 22 is the most successful FIFA ever, launch to date, with net bookings up double digits. Full game sales growth was similarly diverse, with Battlefield, FIFA 22, Madden NFL, It Takes Two, F1, and Mass Effect Legendary Edition all important contributors. On console, digital represented 65% of full game units sold through, up three percentage points from last year. In Mobile, we passed the billion-dollar milestone this year, with nearly $1.2 billion in net bookings. As a result of great work by our teams, our return on advertising spend is now roughly back where it was before the IDFA changes, and now we're looking to maintain that ROAS level as we scale spend back to the level it was before, and as we continue to learn and to adapt to market changes. Across our full portfolio, 12 titles contributed $100 million or more to net bookings in FY '22. Now, let me turn to FY '23. As Andrew laid out, we're entering the year from a position of strength. We're experiencing strong engagement across our live services, have great early indicators for our mobile launches, see continued momentum in our annual sports titles, and have a strong slate of console titles scheduled for the second half. We expect fiscal '23 net bookings to be $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% versus FY '22, driven by growth in live services, particularly in mobile, and supported by the strong launch slate in the second half. Three key drivers of mobile growth in FY '23 are: the launch of Apex Legends Mobile; growth in FIFA Mobile; and the launch of Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth later in the year. FX is a headwind of nearly three points, net of hedges, relative to last year, for both net bookings and underlying profit, which puts our net bookings guidance in constant currency at 8% to 10%. Additionally, the impact of the stoppage of Russia sales is one percentage point to net bookings, and two points to underlying profits. Adjusted for these factors, we continue to see healthy underlying performance, which illustrates the durability of our portfolio of live services. We expect cost of revenue to be $2.020 to $2.065 billion, in part reflecting the anticipated strong growth of our mobile business. We expect operating expenses to be $4.200 to $4.315 billion. This is driven by investment in user acquisition for our two major mobile launches, and adding talent to our development teams to deliver the live services and title slates we have in development for FY '24, FY '25 and beyond. Also note that we've increased the management tax rate used by our long-term model from 18% to 19%, primarily due to U.S. tax rules published in January. We expect operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and capital expenditures of around $200 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. The business continues to be a strong generator of cash, although the year-on-year number is down slightly, primarily due to timing, as our biggest non-sports launch is coming in Q4, with collections in FY '24, and also because our tax rate has increased. We continue to be committed to growing our cash return program, and announced today that we are increasing our dividend by 12%, from $0.17 to $0.19 per share, payable each quarter. We expect to continue to repurchase stock under our current authorization, and we will revisit it closer to the expiration in November of 2022. We expect fiscal '23 GAAP revenue to be $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.87. We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a number of new game launches in Q1, whereas this Q1 is primarily live services, with only F1 22 launching on console and PC later this quarter. In contrast, this coming Q2 has a profile very similar to last year's Q2, with the launches of Madden and FIFA, plus some live services growth offset by some Ultimate Team net bookings phasing into Q3. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, cost of revenue to be $309 million to $321 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.013 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.85 for the first quarter. To conclude, EA delivered another record year, well ahead of our original guidance, driven by strong player engagement across our diverse portfolio of titles. Looking forward, we are capitalizing on this strength to invest in our future. We expect to outgrow the market, to show resilience through uncertain times, building on the foundation of live services and our broad portfolio to deliver growth over the long-term. Now I'll hand the floor back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. As we kick off FY '23, we are investing for growth from a position of strength. With a portfolio of amazing IP, the best talent, and a growing network of highly engaged players, we are scaling to deliver new experiences, on more platforms, across more geographies. Our total addressable market is expanding, and secular trends are driving more consumption of interactive entertainment. Our games are deeply social, and we will continue to build on our strengths as we invest to grow our biggest franchises to connect with more players in the future. We have a clear vision, a clear strategy, and we have a spectacular team ready to deliver in FY '23 for hundreds of millions of players, viewers, and creators around the world. Now Chris and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. It kind of looks like excluding the FX, you guys increased your guidance versus the mid- to high single digits, excluding the FX in Russia that is, versus the high mid-single digits that you had communicated on the third quarter call. First of all, is that the case? And second, has it become more clear since the third quarter call that the churn among gamers who joined during COVID lockdowns has run its course and that average revenue per paying user will remain near the highs seen during the pandemic as 2022 unfolds?\nChris Suh : Great. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the first part first, and then I'll turn it over to Andrew, and he can comment as well on the second part of your question. So from a guidance perspective, we did -- your math is correct. Normalizing for the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which we articulated was three points on net bookings as well as the impact of the decision taken in Russia that effectively puts the equivalent guide more in the high single digits equivalency, which is slightly above the signal that we gave in the last earnings call. So it is indicative of how we finished the quarter with strong player engagement, and we feel good about the outlook.\nAndrew Wilson : And as it relates to player engagement and the value that we see from that over the course of time, I think what you've heard from us throughout COVID is that players sort out our games in the beginning for entertainment reasons, but they stay deeply engaged in them beyond just entertainment. They really saw games as a means of deep social connection with their atomic unit of friends. And this is not four or five friends that you spend a great deal of your social time with. What we have seen even as we are moving past COVID and that people are returning to work and returning to live and returning to school is our engagement has continued to be very, very strong, and in many cases, across some of our franchises at record levels. Given the level of entertainment that we're developing and delivering, given the value of social interaction as part of those experiences, we think this is going to be a continued driver for growth for us.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky : Hi, thank you. Andrew, just on the FIFA license. I was wondering if you could just discuss a little bit more the decision to forego that and how are you kind of thinking about potential risk given the brand shift, but then also the upside in terms of how ending the license kind of frees you up for certain revenue opportunities than in the past would have been restricted?\nAndrew Wilson : Yes. Great question. And as you will have seen from our press release today and certainly I think FIFA affirms some things on their own website, we've been working through this. We're very excited about the future of football. We have, as you heard in the prepared remarks, over 300 licenses that deliver the content and form the experience that we deliver to players that's most meaningful for them. We've got over 150 million players across unique accounts. And so when we think about the future of football right now, we've really made this decision on the basis of being able to deliver experiences that our players wanted. They told, they wanted more modalities of play. They told us they wanted to see more commercial partners in the game that are representative and authentic to the broad global world of football. They're telling us they wanted to move beyond just the core experience and really build out this digital football experience. And they tell us they want to move really, really fast. And so as we move through this, again, we are deeply grateful of our relationship with FIFA for nearly 30 years and deeply respectful for the partnership. And we've worked closely together as two organizations to ensure that we can deliver the biggest FIFA this year that we've ever delivered, featuring World Cup content from both the Men's World Cup and the Women's World Cup for the first time ever. And we work to do that because we believe that's important to our fans. And beyond that, we're excited to work with our 300-plus partners and all the new partners that we're going to have the opportunity to work with to deliver what we believe will be the greatest digital football experience available and sit at the very epicenter of football fandom globally.\nDavid Karnovsky : Okay. Maybe just a follow-up, and I touched on it a little bit, but how do you think specifically about marketing the EA SPORTS FC brand? And would there be initial bump in advertising costs? Or could you just mostly take advantage of that lack of a license fee? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson : Yes. I think it's a little early to tell yet. We're certainly being very thoughtful and deliberate about that. The important thing to understand though is that as you travel around the world and you meet with players who really are deeply engaged with our game, for a player in the U.K., the most important thing to them is the Premier League. For a player in Germany, the most important thing to them is the Bundesliga league. And Spain is La Liga and so on and so forth as you go around the world. What we're focused on right now is building very unique experiences for each of those fans in each of those markets. And what you've seen today is many of our partners come out in support of our ability to do this for our fans. And so certainly, any time you change the name of a product, you must be very thoughtful and we'll certainly have to think about marketing that front. But what gives us confidence as we move into this next phase of growth is that we are working with the partners and the content that our fans love and relate to most directly in the markets in which they do it.\nDavid Karnovsky : Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Soff: Hi, thanks for the question guys. I wanted to dig into the mobile business a bit. You've got Apex on Mobile coming out soon. The FIFA Mobile rebound seems to be doing really well. You announced the new Lord of the Rings game and doing some other stuff on the sports side. So really, the question is how are you guys thinking about the mobile growth opportunity in general. And how has your outlook changed, if at all, since giving that longer-term growth target for the business last year? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson : Yes, great question. I mean we remain very excited about the opportunity in mobile. It continues to be the single biggest gaming platform in the world with a TAM of 3.5 billion players. And so that's just -- to have that kind of TAM access is just extraordinary for us as game makers and delivering live services to that audience. We're seeing really good metrics around Apex Legends right now in test, and that will launch later this year. FIFA had its biggest quarter ever. They had a surge of 80% in users. And Lord of the Rings is coming from what has been our strongest mobile studio capital games who build these type of games and have done so well for us and have such an avid fan following. So as we think about moving forward in mobile, we think that the brands that we have, the expertise that we have, that we've built organically internally and that we've acquired through recent mobile acquisitions represents a really strong opportunity for us over the long term. Remember, when you launch these games, they last for 5-plus years as live services. And what you're seeing this year is three big launches for us in addition to our existing portfolio, which is incredibly strong, and we're going to invest behind that for the long term.\nBenjamin Soff : Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on F1. I believe this upcoming title is the first game in the series that you guys really were able to put your fingerprints on since the acquisition. So can you talk a little bit more about your plans for the franchise, the types of innovation you're bringing to the game? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson : Yes. And that team is an extraordinary team and has always built an incredibly high-quality game, and that was really the impetus for the acquisition to bring that into the EA SPORTS brand portfolio. F1, as you may have seen, if you follow the sport is an all-time high in fandom we had, an extraordinary season last year between Hamilton and Verstappen. We're seeing an incredible season this year with Ferrari leading in the Constructor's Championship and Leclerc and others really pushing Verstappen. And so in our world, if you get to a place where sports fandom is high in engagement and the core sport is high, and then you couple that with an extraordinary development team who have a history and track record of building extremely high-quality products and then you layer in EA SPORTS marketing power and global reach, we think there's incredible opportunity there, and we think that business is going to go from strength to strength.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nEric Handler : Good evening, and thanks for the question. I'm curious to think about the marketing investment that you're going to be spending on Apex Legends for mobile and then you got Lord of the Rings and you're still in the relatively early stages with FIFA for mobile. Should we be thinking about the investment sort of negating a lot of the revenue that comes in from these titles and really, you look to grow the player base in fiscal '23 and then you think about margin expansion in fiscal '24?\nAndrew Wilson : I think that's a good way to think about it. The reality is any time we develop a game and launch a game, there is a combination of development cost and marketing cost to kind of get to launch and get to that critical mass of players at a sequencing of that. It's very different in mobile than it is in traditional console experiences. Traditional console experience, of course, you can spend in development for two, three, four, in some cases, five years, and there's an exceptional amount of development spend upfront. And then the marketing spend proportion of that is much lower. In mobile, the cost of development is lower to get to launch. The acquisition spend early on to supercharge a new launch is higher. But remember, these are live services. And what we're doing is we're driving a golden cohort at the beginning of the launch, and that cohort will continue to deliver a return that we build on over time for the course of the next five plus years. And so early on, you see margin compression in the context of mobile. Over the course of time, you see margin accretion and margin expansion and these live services become global communities of players that continue to play for five plus years and in some cases, as long as a decade.\nChris Suh : Yes. Maybe I could just add on to that, Eric. As you have a chance to go through your -- the model and the guidance that we gave, you'll see that is implied in that -- in the guidance and the cost structure, it is the points that -- to reiterate the points that Andrew made, we're excited about our opportunity in mobile. It represents an enormous TAM opportunity. We're excited about what we have in store for this year. It is a different margin profile, especially in the short term. But as Andrew pointed out, once we get to scale, we see great profit -- revenue and profit opportunity, and we're really excited about the opportunity you had.\nEric Handler: Great. And then just as a follow-up, I believe you said, Andrew, six new sports titles this year. I wonder if you could give a little color on that. Are these mobile titles? Are these new PC console games? What can you tell us there?\nAndrew Wilson : So it's the cast of characters that you would expect from us, plus F1, so we would stretch our FIFA product, that's NHL, that's Madden NFL, that's F1. We've got a new golf game. I'm trying to think now, you've caught me off guard -- and super mega baseball, which was an acquired property. So yes, so -- and that's across console, PC and in some cases, mobile.\nEric Handler: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead \nDrew Crum: Hi guys. Good afternoon. I want to drill down a little bit more on Apex Legends. You're lapping a 40%-plus comp but also launching on mobile. What are your expectations for franchise net bookings in fiscal '23? And will you make any changes to the cadence of live services or content drops across the franchise now that it will be on mobile? Thanks.\nChris Suh : Yes. No, it's a great question. Thank you for the question. As you rightly pointed out, Apex Legends had a terrific year in FY '22. We're across both financial metrics, but also all the player engagement data that Andrew spoke to. And so we're really excited about how we finished the year, coming out of that with a lot of momentum. We do have profitable growth planned again in FY '23. It's a large franchise for us. It's a big business. And so we'll see continued growth on that on the console and on the HD side. In addition to that, with the Apex mobile launch, we are anticipating this to be one of the most exciting launches that we've had on mobile ever. And so the combination of that indicates a lot of optimism and strength for the Apex mobile or Apex Legends business all up.\nAndrew Wilson: And in terms of the cadence of content drops and experience updates and events, again, the Respawn team and the Apex team have demonstrated over the course of the last two plus years an extraordinary connection with their community. And they've been able to figure out exactly when and how to make drops and things that the community wants and needs. And so we don't have a hard and fast rule in terms of which drops will happen when. We really allow the team to work deep with the community. But I think as you -- as the franchise continues to grow and as we move on mobile and launch and grow on a global basis, I think it's reasonable to believe that over the course of time, there will be more and more content launched into the world and a new season starting today, which off the back of a record season 12, we expect will continue to do well. I know Newcastle is a new legend is why the game is going to be one of the great legends inside the game experience.\nDrew Crum: Thank you, guys.\nChris Suh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please go ahead.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks everyone. Good afternoon, and welcome, Chris. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last question, first off. I guess there may be some changes to the release of Legends going forward on Apex. So curious how you think that might impact engagement or each of the contributions from stories going forward. And then the question -- the other question is despite these results, I wonder, Andrew, what you think the impact has been on growth from the persistent short supplies of consoles and GPU chips, et cetera? And what's also factored in the outlook from that perspective? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So let me touch on the first two and then I'll let Chris take the outlook piece. Again, I think that each time the team releases new content, new events, we see growing engagement and have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to really understand the things that are going to drive ongoing engagement for our community. So I wouldn't expect that we would see any decline in engagement with more content, quite the opposite. I think as we go to more platforms and we build out our engagement model over the course of time, I think that we'll see a growing audience, and I think we'll see growing engagement. And that has been our experience so far. In terms of supply chain shortages, again, we've just come off a record year. We beat on almost every measure, even in the face of what is almost certainly supply chain shortages around consoles and chipsets and graphics cards and these types of things. It's hard to know how much bigger that would be. I have to imagine with more consoles out there and more PCs and more graphics cards that our results may have been even better, but we're very happy with the results we had, and we look forward to as supply chain issues start to ease and more consoles end up in the marketplace and more graphics cards and more PC availability that more games have access to higher-quality machines, and that ultimately will drive engagement for us. If you go back through the course of time, at each platform transition, at each technology evolution, the gaming TAM and the gaming community broadly has grown. And so I think this only represents upside for us.\nChris Suh : I'll just add on to Andrew's good summation. From a market standpoint, from the composition of our business, I think this is one of the things that really sort of illustrates the resilience of the live services business model, which with 71% of our business -- or over 71% of our business in FY '22, and it will grow as a share of our business next year with -- especially with the launches of mobile. And so from one standpoint, we feel good about that. And that's all embedded into the guide that you heard us talk about at length. Specific to the console market, we are anticipating Gen 5 console units to be up year-on-year, and that will also be an added tailwind to the business all in all.\nColin Sebastian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Pardon me, your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Wilson: Charlie, I think he dropped off the line. So we can move to the next one.\nOperator: Sure. No problem, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Thornton: Hi, good afternoon, Andrew and Chris. A couple of interrelated ones, if I could. I'm going to ask a question that was asked earlier but in a little bit of a different way. Since you guys talked about mid- to high single-digit bookings growth last quarter, as you've alluded to, there's a lot of incremental headwinds. So my first question is, is there anything that's changed in the fleet as you think about fiscal '23 versus kind of what you were thinking three months ago? That's question one. Question number two, the slate talked about a major IP in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious if there's a reason why that would fit better in fiscal 4Q as opposed to the traditional holiday quarter in 3Q where you typically might put a big piece of IP. Any thoughts there? And then just finally on -- maybe, Andrew, you could talk a little bit about just the work-from-home transition to back to office, how that's playing into productivity and how that maybe gives you confidence that you could kind of release these titles because you do have quite a few in the back half of the year, including in 4Q. So I'm just curious your level of comfort with that based on what you're seeing in the productivity trends. Thanks guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. So there was a lot in there.\nChris Suh: Three parts.\nAndrew Wilson: I think the first one was do we anticipate slight change as an additional element as we kind of have got from third quarter through fourth quarter. The short answer is no. We continue to believe our slate is strong. I think the second question was we've got a major IP in the fourth quarter and why not do that in the holiday quarter. And I would say two things to that. One is we want to get to the highest quality games we possibly can. We're committed to quality. We're committed to giving our development teams all the time they need to build great games and deliver those through a global audience. Underlying that, I'd also highlight, though, that the nature of our business is changing. As Chris pointed out, 71% of our business is coming from live services. And so these traditional launch windows that have been so important in our industry for the longest time aren't as relevant now in a world where players are playing our games day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out. And so the combination of the changing nature of engagement consumption of our games and our deep desire to give our teams all the time they need to get to the best possible game experience really is what's driving that Q4 launch. And then I think the last part of your question was around work-from-home and how is that looking, and I would say, it's still early. We're seeing more and more people back into offices Again, there are still waves of COVID out there, and we're seeing some rising numbers in certain geographies. And good news is, is the severity of infection or the severity of symptoms from infections seems to be much lower than the initial waves and phase of COVID. So I think that's good just for humanity broadly. And certainly, we're seeing a return to office kind of moving through its general iteration. In terms of confidence that I have in launching the games through the year, I have strong confidence largely because having done this for two years, we launched more content than any other developer and publisher video games through this time. And our teams have demonstrated unbelievable tenacity and unbelievable wherewithal. And we've really harnessed the power of our platform technology to continue to deliver games even while working from home. So as people come back together, we get to see more collaboration. I think things get easier. But even if that ends up being a little slower than we would hope, given the ingenuity of our teams, I still have strong confidence in our ability to launch our full slate of high-quality titles this year. I think that was all of them.\nChris Suh: I think you got them.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMike Hickey: Hi, guys. Andrew, and Chris, and Chris, great result, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First question, I guess, just on the economy here. It's been a while, I think, Andrew, has been the business has sort of been captured with our recession. So whether or not we going recession, who knows? How do you think about [technical difficulty] player fee closing up now that pretty much service versus premium digital versus [technical difficulty]. Would you imagine a sort of mix shift, if we do have recession here or pullback in discretionary spend towards free-to-play? Just sort of guess the puts and takes on your clarity and then how you factor that into your guidance? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you, guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. There was a little jumble, Mike. I'm sorry, but I think that the gist of the question was with the macroeconomic climate out there, and I think you mentioned the notion of recession, how do we think about that? How do we think about building our plan and probably specifically you're thinking around OpEx. I think -- and Chris can weigh in here as well. We've been very thoughtful about this as we're embarking on the year ahead. And certainly, there are people way smarter than us who were kind of predicting what will be the macroeconomic outcome over the course of time. Here's what we see. We see we're coming out of a year with record performance. We're seeing our network grow dramatically and engagement grow dramatically. And we're seeing our games used not just for entertainment, but also for social interaction and social connection. We -- so that gives us confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business over the long term. As we look back over previous times where there may have been challenged consumer spending, our industry now games specifically have actually done very, very well for two reasons. One, entertainment really is a fundamental human need. And two, the form of entertainment that we deliver is extremely high value to consumers, given that you get thousands of hours of engagement when you play one of our games. And so our expectation is that even in an environment of macro challenge that our industry now games will continue to do well. One of the other things that we have -- where we've gone back and really looked at this, though, and you study it, is you discover that companies that can invest from a position of strength going into an environment like the one seemingly we're moving into actually benefit disproportionately as you come out of that. And so I think if you take in the fact that we have a growing network, growing engagement, record performance, our games fulfill both entertainment and social interaction than if you look back in history, our industry has performed very well at times like this. And when you take the strength of our business and our ability to invest against new titles this year, as well as titles we developed for the out years, we feel like we've put ourselves in a really strong position even if we were going into a challenging macro headwind. With that being said, we have built flexibility in the plan. You should know that we will be extraordinarily disciplined around costs as we move through this. And that should there be something unforeseen to us, that we have levers in our model that will allow us to adjust. But we do believe it is behest of us to invest from a position of strength as we go into this market.\nMike Hickey: Thank you.\nChris Suh: Well, I think, well, everything, but that was good.\nMike Hickey: Whole day, okay. Sounds good. Second question, Microsoft, hope you can hear me. Microsoft and Sony were sort of flirting -- at least that was the rumor flirting with the idea of adding advertisements into free-to-play game experiences maybe as a way to sort of help developers monetize their player community. And of course, you guys -- you go way back to Burnout Paradise to sort of impetus for trying the idea on the billboards in that game. So obviously, this idea has created a lot of debate within the player community. But just sort of curious your thoughts on whether or not ad monetization and free-to-play games is something that you think can be meaningful and then how you sort of balance that with the player experience. Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. And so for us, I think you finish there where we start, which is the player experience. We want to ensure that the player experience is the best possible player experience that we can provide. And that's why you've seen us kind of test various models over the course of time, some have continued and some we have stopped on the basis of really upholding the best possible player experience we can. What we've seen generally though in entertainment media and even in games, particularly in mobile games right now, you see that there is a place for advertising when done right. And there is a portion of the community that when given the choice will participate in advertising where it benefits their gameplay experience. I think we've learned some of this from Glu as we brought Glu organization, and we've seen this across the industry. And so you should expect that we would continue to kind of test different things, ensuring first and foremost, that we uphold the best possible player experience. But where there is an audience -- but given the choice we'd like to engage with advertising, they have the ability to do so, we want to make that available to them.\nMike Hickey: Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on the FIFA title this year. I believe you guys are already testing cross-play support FIFA 22. So I presume that next year the '23. So what is the impact of profit actually of player engagement? And then similarly, can you remind us what the magnitude of uplift was from including a World Cup mode within FIFA?\nAndrew Wilson : Let me start on the World Cup mode with FIFA. And again, in the context of live service, we're always balancing the investment of time and the investment of dollars from the community. And at any given point in time, based on what's going on in the world of that game and in this case, in the world of football and of the gameplay community, we will look to leverage new content and new events and new experiences either to drive greater engagement and provide new interesting things for players to do or it might be a monetization opportunity. You might recall the last time we did the World Cup, it was an extraordinary engagement opportunity. And I don't have the numbers at the tip of my fingers. But if I remember rightly, we brought 12 million or 13 million people back into the game who had lapsed out of the game through World Cup content and drove incredible engagement through the event and then, of course, as part of the ongoing live service, continue to grow the business over the course of time. We will think about it this year in the same context. We're always thinking about our player community and always thinking about the balance between the investment of time and the investment of dollars, all in service of a more positive and more immersive and a more entertaining player experience. In terms of the value of cross-play, I don't think we have any specific data on that yet out of FIFA. In other franchises is certainly where you get greater liquidity in the franchise and friends can play with each other across devices. That's always a good thing for players. But remember, in our FIFA experience, which has 30-plus million people playing across console and PC, it's already a highly liquid community and every platform already has more enough players to sustain the ongoing player experience. But certainly, as we think about the future of all of our franchises, we want to get to a place where the entire community can play together, and that will be part of our driver as we move forward.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks, Andrew. And then just one on Battlefield, I was just curious if there's any updates on that franchise. I know you guys previously mentioned you're willing to kind of invest more into the franchise in the long term. But has that mindset changed in the past few weeks given the lack of resurgence from the last update? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson : No. And again, we take a long view here. This is one of the great franchises in our industry, built by one of the great teams in our industry. And our expectation is that we'll continue to grow and be a really important part of our portfolio for many, many years to come. We've got incredible leadership over that team now. They're rethinking the development process from the ground up and really using kind of the Vince Zampella/Respawn model of get to the fun as quickly as possible. They've been doing thousands of updates for the community working on quality of life and really getting the core game right. I think there's still more work for us to do there, and the team is committed to doing that work for the community. And beyond that, once we get to a place where we feel like we're in the right place with the core experience and with the core game, then you should expect us to invest and grow beyond where the game is at today.\nMario Lu: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDoug Creutz: Hi, thanks. I think on the last call, you'd indicated that the Battlefield mobile game was close to going into Closed Beta. And at least at one point, you seem to indicate it might be a fiscal '23 launch. Can you just kind of update on where that is, how the Closed Beta go? And how you're feeling about timing for the title at this point?\nAndrew Wilson : Yes. Right now, I think we're looking at going into further testing at the end of May and then subject to the metrics and the data that we've seen and the engagement they see, we might look toward the end of this year, beginning of next year for a global launch. Remember, in mobile, it all really comes down to the tuning and balancing once we go into kind of that Closed Beta phase. We don't have any money in FY '23 right now against that title. So if it was to launch in the year, that would be an upside potential for us. And we want to give ourselves the opportunity to ensure that we -- the game has all the soft launch and Closed Beta that it needs in order to tune and balance. But having played the game, I can tell you, I think that we're excited for the potential.\nDoug Creutz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Bass with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nJamie Bass: Hello guys, and thanks for taking my questions. I just got a couple if that's okay. Firstly, you were talking about the sort of positive metrics within mobile coming back to the levels that were pre-IDFA. Two things on that. Firstly, could you give us sort of an indication of what your expectations are for the key core franchises as in not bringing in Apex mobile and you already had within the mobile franchise. And then second question is on the more boring topics on developer cost inflation, wage inflation. Do you have sort of an outlook for what you're expecting this year in terms of new hires, whether you're expecting a certain percentage in terms of how much actually you need to pay to bring on new developers? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Maybe I'll start with the second one, and then we'll move back to the first one. Certainly, I think that competition for great talent has always been incredibly high in our industry, and that's no different now. When we think about hiring new talent and we talk to candidates, they really make employment decisions based on four key vectors: what is the work they're going to do; who are the people they're going to do it with, of course, what is going to be the conversation; and their opportunity to learn and grow. And as we lean into hiring, we're really leaning to all four of those vectors and try and create a culture where this is a great place to make games. We were able to hire a record numbers in FY '22, even amidst what was already a very competitive marketplace. We expect to continue hiring., I think that we've been recognized by a number of surveys as an extraordinary place to work and we've really focused on the culture of our company and ensuring that we are a great place to come and create games. That doesn't mean we won't be challenged in the marketplace. I think it's going to be more and more challenged. But so far, we have not had trouble hiring incredible talent, and we brought in some amazing new creators and people across our business, quite frankly, through FY '22.\nChris Suh: And on your question specifically, as I commented in my comments in my prepared remarks about the IDFA changes, it is something we're still working through. We have seen some positive movement toward reaching related levels pre-IDFA, and we feel optimistic that we're sort of through the tougher part of it, and we feel good about the outlook from here.\nChris Evenden: And that brings us to the end of\u2026\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Could I just?\nChris Evenden: Okay. Go ahead, sorry.\nAndrew Wilson: I'll catch up with you afterwards. So that was just going to say that brings us to the end of the call today. So thanks, everyone, for your time, and we look forward to speaking to you in the next quarter.\nChris Suh: Thank you so much.\nChris Evenden: Thank you, all.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew and good afternoon everyone. As Andrew said, FY '22 was a record year, with net bookings that exceeded $7.5 billion. This is more than $200 million ahead of original guidance, driven by growing player engagement across our broad portfolio of live services and games. We grew both net bookings and underlying profit by over 20% for the full year. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.9 billion, nearly $150 million above our original guidance, and we returned almost $1.5 billion to shareholders. These results speak to the power of our diverse portfolio, and to the durability and consistency of a live services business founded on deep player engagement. For the fourth quarter, net bookings were $1.75 billion, up 18% from the prior year, and reaching a new Q4 high, even with the action we took to cease sales in Russia and Belarus during the quarter. Live services net bookings grew 14% year-over-year. We delivered Q4 net revenue of over $1.8 billion, ahead of our expectations and up 36% year-over-year. Underlying profit was well above our expectations. Q4 operating expenses came in lower than our expectations, driven by the timing of some marketing and sales activities. We are continuing to prioritize our investments into our best long-term growth opportunities, while also remaining agile to realize cost savings and implement efficiencies where appropriate. We generated $444 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, and returned a further $373 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, let me talk about our full year performance. Live services net bookings grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $5.4 billion, and made up over 71% of our total business. Full game sales were up 34% to $2.1 billion. Our healthy live services growth was driven by strength across our broad-based portfolio, mostly notably by Apex Legends and FIFA. Apex Legends is up over 40% for the year, taking it past the $2 billion milestone in lifetime net bookings. Season 12 finished yesterday, and was the most successful ever. And, of course, Apex Legends Mobile is performing well in tests and is close to launch. FIFA 22 is the most successful FIFA ever, launch to date, with net bookings up double digits. Full game sales growth was similarly diverse, with Battlefield, FIFA 22, Madden NFL, It Takes Two, F1, and Mass Effect Legendary Edition all important contributors. On console, digital represented 65% of full game units sold through, up three percentage points from last year. In Mobile, we passed the billion-dollar milestone this year, with nearly $1.2 billion in net bookings. As a result of great work by our teams, our return on advertising spend is now roughly back where it was before the IDFA changes, and now we're looking to maintain that ROAS level as we scale spend back to the level it was before, and as we continue to learn and to adapt to market changes. Across our full portfolio, 12 titles contributed $100 million or more to net bookings in FY '22. Now, let me turn to FY '23. As Andrew laid out, we're entering the year from a position of strength. We're experiencing strong engagement across our live services, have great early indicators for our mobile launches, see continued momentum in our annual sports titles, and have a strong slate of console titles scheduled for the second half. We expect fiscal '23 net bookings to be $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% versus FY '22, driven by growth in live services, particularly in mobile, and supported by the strong launch slate in the second half. Three key drivers of mobile growth in FY '23 are: the launch of Apex Legends Mobile; growth in FIFA Mobile; and the launch of Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth later in the year. FX is a headwind of nearly three points, net of hedges, relative to last year, for both net bookings and underlying profit, which puts our net bookings guidance in constant currency at 8% to 10%. Additionally, the impact of the stoppage of Russia sales is one percentage point to net bookings, and two points to underlying profits. Adjusted for these factors, we continue to see healthy underlying performance, which illustrates the durability of our portfolio of live services. We expect cost of revenue to be $2.020 to $2.065 billion, in part reflecting the anticipated strong growth of our mobile business. We expect operating expenses to be $4.200 to $4.315 billion. This is driven by investment in user acquisition for our two major mobile launches, and adding talent to our development teams to deliver the live services and title slates we have in development for FY '24, FY '25 and beyond. Also note that we've increased the management tax rate used by our long-term model from 18% to 19%, primarily due to U.S. tax rules published in January. We expect operating cash flow of $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and capital expenditures of around $200 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. The business continues to be a strong generator of cash, although the year-on-year number is down slightly, primarily due to timing, as our biggest non-sports launch is coming in Q4, with collections in FY '24, and also because our tax rate has increased. We continue to be committed to growing our cash return program, and announced today that we are increasing our dividend by 12%, from $0.17 to $0.19 per share, payable each quarter. We expect to continue to repurchase stock under our current authorization, and we will revisit it closer to the expiration in November of 2022. We expect fiscal '23 GAAP revenue to be $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.87. We anticipate net bookings for the first quarter to be $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a number of new game launches in Q1, whereas this Q1 is primarily live services, with only F1 22 launching on console and PC later this quarter. In contrast, this coming Q2 has a profile very similar to last year's Q2, with the launches of Madden and FIFA, plus some live services growth offset by some Ultimate Team net bookings phasing into Q3. For the first quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, cost of revenue to be $309 million to $321 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.013 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.85 for the first quarter. To conclude, EA delivered another record year, well ahead of our original guidance, driven by strong player engagement across our diverse portfolio of titles. Looking forward, we are capitalizing on this strength to invest in our future. We expect to outgrow the market, to show resilience through uncertain times, building on the foundation of live services and our broad portfolio to deliver growth over the long-term. Now I'll hand the floor back to Andrew. Great. Thank you for the question. I'll start with the first part first, and then I'll turn it over to Andrew, and he can comment as well on the second part of your question. So from a guidance perspective, we did -- your math is correct. Normalizing for the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, which we articulated was three points on net bookings as well as the impact of the decision taken in Russia that effectively puts the equivalent guide more in the high single digits equivalency, which is slightly above the signal that we gave in the last earnings call. So it is indicative of how we finished the quarter with strong player engagement, and we feel good about the outlook. Yes. Maybe I could just add on to that, Eric. As you have a chance to go through your -- the model and the guidance that we gave, you'll see that is implied in that -- in the guidance and the cost structure, it is the points that -- to reiterate the points that Andrew made, we're excited about our opportunity in mobile. It represents an enormous TAM opportunity. We're excited about what we have in store for this year. It is a different margin profile, especially in the short term. But as Andrew pointed out, once we get to scale, we see great profit -- revenue and profit opportunity, and we're really excited about the opportunity you had. Yes. No, it's a great question. Thank you for the question. As you rightly pointed out, Apex Legends had a terrific year in FY '22. We're across both financial metrics, but also all the player engagement data that Andrew spoke to. And so we're really excited about how we finished the year, coming out of that with a lot of momentum. We do have profitable growth planned again in FY '23. It's a large franchise for us. It's a big business. And so we'll see continued growth on that on the console and on the HD side. In addition to that, with the Apex mobile launch, we are anticipating this to be one of the most exciting launches that we've had on mobile ever. And so the combination of that indicates a lot of optimism and strength for the Apex mobile or Apex Legends business all up. Thank you. I'll just add on to Andrew's good summation. From a market standpoint, from the composition of our business, I think this is one of the things that really sort of illustrates the resilience of the live services business model, which with 71% of our business -- or over 71% of our business in FY '22, and it will grow as a share of our business next year with -- especially with the launches of mobile. And so from one standpoint, we feel good about that. And that's all embedded into the guide that you heard us talk about at length. Specific to the console market, we are anticipating Gen 5 console units to be up year-on-year, and that will also be an added tailwind to the business all in all. Three parts. I think you got them. Well, I think, well, everything, but that was good. And on your question specifically, as I commented in my comments in my prepared remarks about the IDFA changes, it is something we're still working through. We have seen some positive movement toward reaching related levels pre-IDFA, and we feel optimistic that we're sort of through the tougher part of it, and we feel good about the outlook from here. Thank you so much."

            "content": "Thanks Chris. I hope all of you are well. I want to start by thanking our incredible teams at Electronic Arts. We have the most talented people in the industry who, every day, demonstrate passion, creativity, and determination. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to Chris Suh. Chris joined us in March as our new Chief Financial Officer. He is an exceptionally qualified leader, and I am looking forward to our partnership as we drive our next phase of growth. EA delivered profitable growth in FY '22, a record year in every important measure of our business. Total players, engagement in our games and live services, net bookings, and underlying profit. We grew our global network of players to more than 580 million unique active accounts, fueled by new players joining titles including EA SPORTS FIFA, Apex Legends and The Sims, and new players that we welcomed from our acquisitions. The strength of our broad IP portfolio, our creative talent together with highly re-occurring revenue streams continues to super-charge growth in our business. We delivered $7.515 billion in net bookings and underlying profit grew more than 20%. It was a record year, and our talented teams rose to the challenge in a big way, to inspire and entertain hundreds of millions of engaged players worldwide. Games are now central to people's lives, and younger audiences have more power as consumers. Gen Alpha, Gen Z and Millennials are digital natives and they are gaming-first generations. They see gaming as their number one choice for entertainment. The consumption of entertainment and sport is deeply social, with players across our network using games to stay connected to friends, and to express themselves. The future of entertainment is interactive, and we derive strength from three structural advantages: our IP; our incredible talent; and our growing network of players deeply engaged in our live services. First, our IP. Everything begins with amazing games, and we continue to invest in one of the most powerful IP portfolios in all of entertainment. Apex Legends will expand in every dimension, going from strength to strength. New gameplay is coming to the console and PC live service; our new mobile service launches globally this month; and the grand finale of the 2022 Apex Legends Global Series for esports is in July. EA SPORTS & Racing is set to grow significantly in FY '23. We have six new EA SPORTS titles this year, with more in development Our pipeline for this year and future years features big, beloved IP that we cannot wait for players to experience including Need for Speed, Dead Space, Star Wars, The Sims, Skate, our Bioware franchises, and Lord of the Rings. Our two new studios in Seattle are working on new projects, our Motive studio has an unannounced title in development, and we have more underway across our global studio teams. Next, we have the best talent in the world. Making amazing games starts with incredible game makers. Innovating across our business, our people make Electronic Arts a great place to work from delivering safe and secure platforms, to telling exciting stories and developing our next generation of creators. We are a collective team of leaders who together deliver one of the broadest portfolios in the industry every year, while continuing to pioneer new experiences. We are proud of our distinctive talent from across the many parts of EA for continuing to deliver more exceptional games and content at scale. Finally, we have a large growing network of players deeply engaged in live services. To provide a sense of scale, we had more daily, weekly, and monthly active players across our entire portfolio. FIFA Mobile recorded its biggest quarter ever, with unique new players surging nearly 80% year-over-year, and Apex Legends is amongst the top live service games in the industry. As we look ahead, we are investing in ways for fans to have amazing, shared experiences together, whether that's by playing, watching or creating. Through our console, PC, and mobile live services; through esports; through other original content; and with tools that unleash the creativity of our players, we will grow what are already some of the world's largest and most engaged entertainment communities. Earlier today we announced that starting next fiscal year, our football experiences will move under a new EA SPORTS FC brand. This is such an exciting moment for us and our fans. We've just had our biggest year ever for EA SPORTS FIFA games, building on nearly 30 years of connected experiences for players across more than 150 million unique accounts. With more than 300 license partners, 30 leagues and federations, 700 teams, and 19,000 athletes, the future of global football is huge. We're excited to grow EA SPORTS FC. It will be the only place that fans can play in the UEFA Champions League, CONMEBOL Libertadores, the Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, LaLiga, MLS and many others. Our global football franchise has long been at the forefront of innovation. From the first isometric playing angles, to online play, Ultimate Team and Women's Teams, the first narrative story mode with The Journey, to VOLTA, to Hypermotion, we have repeatedly delivered new ways to play the game. We're thankful for many great years of partnership with FIFA, and we are looking forward to delivering another full EA SPORTS FIFA game later this year, filled with great features and World Cup content. Then, the new era begins next year with EA SPORTS FC. With a total addressable market of more than 3.5 billion football and soccer fans worldwide, EA SPORTS FC will be the authentic, inclusive, and immersive global entertainment property at the epicenter of football fandom. We have amazing games, we've built around powerful IP, made by incredibly talented teams. We have a network of more than half a billion player accounts. We have outstanding engagement in our games and live services, fueled by social connection and shared experiences. With these strengths at our core, FY '23 is set to be a year of innovation, growth, and leadership for Electronic Arts. Now I'll hand the call over to Chris. Thanks, Chris. As we kick off FY '23, we are investing for growth from a position of strength. With a portfolio of amazing IP, the best talent, and a growing network of highly engaged players, we are scaling to deliver new experiences, on more platforms, across more geographies. Our total addressable market is expanding, and secular trends are driving more consumption of interactive entertainment. Our games are deeply social, and we will continue to build on our strengths as we invest to grow our biggest franchises to connect with more players in the future. We have a clear vision, a clear strategy, and we have a spectacular team ready to deliver in FY '23 for hundreds of millions of players, viewers, and creators around the world. Now Chris and I are here for your questions. And as it relates to player engagement and the value that we see from that over the course of time, I think what you've heard from us throughout COVID is that players sort out our games in the beginning for entertainment reasons, but they stay deeply engaged in them beyond just entertainment. They really saw games as a means of deep social connection with their atomic unit of friends. And this is not four or five friends that you spend a great deal of your social time with. What we have seen even as we are moving past COVID and that people are returning to work and returning to live and returning to school is our engagement has continued to be very, very strong, and in many cases, across some of our franchises at record levels. Given the level of entertainment that we're developing and delivering, given the value of social interaction as part of those experiences, we think this is going to be a continued driver for growth for us. Yes. Great question. And as you will have seen from our press release today and certainly I think FIFA affirms some things on their own website, we've been working through this. We're very excited about the future of football. We have, as you heard in the prepared remarks, over 300 licenses that deliver the content and form the experience that we deliver to players that's most meaningful for them. We've got over 150 million players across unique accounts. And so when we think about the future of football right now, we've really made this decision on the basis of being able to deliver experiences that our players wanted. They told, they wanted more modalities of play. They told us they wanted to see more commercial partners in the game that are representative and authentic to the broad global world of football. They're telling us they wanted to move beyond just the core experience and really build out this digital football experience. And they tell us they want to move really, really fast. And so as we move through this, again, we are deeply grateful of our relationship with FIFA for nearly 30 years and deeply respectful for the partnership. And we've worked closely together as two organizations to ensure that we can deliver the biggest FIFA this year that we've ever delivered, featuring World Cup content from both the Men's World Cup and the Women's World Cup for the first time ever. And we work to do that because we believe that's important to our fans. And beyond that, we're excited to work with our 300-plus partners and all the new partners that we're going to have the opportunity to work with to deliver what we believe will be the greatest digital football experience available and sit at the very epicenter of football fandom globally. Yes. I think it's a little early to tell yet. We're certainly being very thoughtful and deliberate about that. The important thing to understand though is that as you travel around the world and you meet with players who really are deeply engaged with our game, for a player in the U.K., the most important thing to them is the Premier League. For a player in Germany, the most important thing to them is the Bundesliga league. And Spain is La Liga and so on and so forth as you go around the world. What we're focused on right now is building very unique experiences for each of those fans in each of those markets. And what you've seen today is many of our partners come out in support of our ability to do this for our fans. And so certainly, any time you change the name of a product, you must be very thoughtful and we'll certainly have to think about marketing that front. But what gives us confidence as we move into this next phase of growth is that we are working with the partners and the content that our fans love and relate to most directly in the markets in which they do it. Yes, great question. I mean we remain very excited about the opportunity in mobile. It continues to be the single biggest gaming platform in the world with a TAM of 3.5 billion players. And so that's just -- to have that kind of TAM access is just extraordinary for us as game makers and delivering live services to that audience. We're seeing really good metrics around Apex Legends right now in test, and that will launch later this year. FIFA had its biggest quarter ever. They had a surge of 80% in users. And Lord of the Rings is coming from what has been our strongest mobile studio capital games who build these type of games and have done so well for us and have such an avid fan following. So as we think about moving forward in mobile, we think that the brands that we have, the expertise that we have, that we've built organically internally and that we've acquired through recent mobile acquisitions represents a really strong opportunity for us over the long term. Remember, when you launch these games, they last for 5-plus years as live services. And what you're seeing this year is three big launches for us in addition to our existing portfolio, which is incredibly strong, and we're going to invest behind that for the long term. Yes. And that team is an extraordinary team and has always built an incredibly high-quality game, and that was really the impetus for the acquisition to bring that into the EA SPORTS brand portfolio. F1, as you may have seen, if you follow the sport is an all-time high in fandom we had, an extraordinary season last year between Hamilton and Verstappen. We're seeing an incredible season this year with Ferrari leading in the Constructor's Championship and Leclerc and others really pushing Verstappen. And so in our world, if you get to a place where sports fandom is high in engagement and the core sport is high, and then you couple that with an extraordinary development team who have a history and track record of building extremely high-quality products and then you layer in EA SPORTS marketing power and global reach, we think there's incredible opportunity there, and we think that business is going to go from strength to strength. I think that's a good way to think about it. The reality is any time we develop a game and launch a game, there is a combination of development cost and marketing cost to kind of get to launch and get to that critical mass of players at a sequencing of that. It's very different in mobile than it is in traditional console experiences. Traditional console experience, of course, you can spend in development for two, three, four, in some cases, five years, and there's an exceptional amount of development spend upfront. And then the marketing spend proportion of that is much lower. In mobile, the cost of development is lower to get to launch. The acquisition spend early on to supercharge a new launch is higher. But remember, these are live services. And what we're doing is we're driving a golden cohort at the beginning of the launch, and that cohort will continue to deliver a return that we build on over time for the course of the next five plus years. And so early on, you see margin compression in the context of mobile. Over the course of time, you see margin accretion and margin expansion and these live services become global communities of players that continue to play for five plus years and in some cases, as long as a decade. So it's the cast of characters that you would expect from us, plus F1, so we would stretch our FIFA product, that's NHL, that's Madden NFL, that's F1. We've got a new golf game. I'm trying to think now, you've caught me off guard -- and super mega baseball, which was an acquired property. So yes, so -- and that's across console, PC and in some cases, mobile. And in terms of the cadence of content drops and experience updates and events, again, the Respawn team and the Apex team have demonstrated over the course of the last two plus years an extraordinary connection with their community. And they've been able to figure out exactly when and how to make drops and things that the community wants and needs. And so we don't have a hard and fast rule in terms of which drops will happen when. We really allow the team to work deep with the community. But I think as you -- as the franchise continues to grow and as we move on mobile and launch and grow on a global basis, I think it's reasonable to believe that over the course of time, there will be more and more content launched into the world and a new season starting today, which off the back of a record season 12, we expect will continue to do well. I know Newcastle is a new legend is why the game is going to be one of the great legends inside the game experience. Yes. So let me touch on the first two and then I'll let Chris take the outlook piece. Again, I think that each time the team releases new content, new events, we see growing engagement and have demonstrated an extraordinary ability to really understand the things that are going to drive ongoing engagement for our community. So I wouldn't expect that we would see any decline in engagement with more content, quite the opposite. I think as we go to more platforms and we build out our engagement model over the course of time, I think that we'll see a growing audience, and I think we'll see growing engagement. And that has been our experience so far. In terms of supply chain shortages, again, we've just come off a record year. We beat on almost every measure, even in the face of what is almost certainly supply chain shortages around consoles and chipsets and graphics cards and these types of things. It's hard to know how much bigger that would be. I have to imagine with more consoles out there and more PCs and more graphics cards that our results may have been even better, but we're very happy with the results we had, and we look forward to as supply chain issues start to ease and more consoles end up in the marketplace and more graphics cards and more PC availability that more games have access to higher-quality machines, and that ultimately will drive engagement for us. If you go back through the course of time, at each platform transition, at each technology evolution, the gaming TAM and the gaming community broadly has grown. And so I think this only represents upside for us. Charlie, I think he dropped off the line. So we can move to the next one. Okay. So there was a lot in there. I think the first one was do we anticipate slight change as an additional element as we kind of have got from third quarter through fourth quarter. The short answer is no. We continue to believe our slate is strong. I think the second question was we've got a major IP in the fourth quarter and why not do that in the holiday quarter. And I would say two things to that. One is we want to get to the highest quality games we possibly can. We're committed to quality. We're committed to giving our development teams all the time they need to build great games and deliver those through a global audience. Underlying that, I'd also highlight, though, that the nature of our business is changing. As Chris pointed out, 71% of our business is coming from live services. And so these traditional launch windows that have been so important in our industry for the longest time aren't as relevant now in a world where players are playing our games day in, day out, week in, week out, month in, month out. And so the combination of the changing nature of engagement consumption of our games and our deep desire to give our teams all the time they need to get to the best possible game experience really is what's driving that Q4 launch. And then I think the last part of your question was around work-from-home and how is that looking, and I would say, it's still early. We're seeing more and more people back into offices Again, there are still waves of COVID out there, and we're seeing some rising numbers in certain geographies. And good news is, is the severity of infection or the severity of symptoms from infections seems to be much lower than the initial waves and phase of COVID. So I think that's good just for humanity broadly. And certainly, we're seeing a return to office kind of moving through its general iteration. In terms of confidence that I have in launching the games through the year, I have strong confidence largely because having done this for two years, we launched more content than any other developer and publisher video games through this time. And our teams have demonstrated unbelievable tenacity and unbelievable wherewithal. And we've really harnessed the power of our platform technology to continue to deliver games even while working from home. So as people come back together, we get to see more collaboration. I think things get easier. But even if that ends up being a little slower than we would hope, given the ingenuity of our teams, I still have strong confidence in our ability to launch our full slate of high-quality titles this year. I think that was all of them. Yes. There was a little jumble, Mike. I'm sorry, but I think that the gist of the question was with the macroeconomic climate out there, and I think you mentioned the notion of recession, how do we think about that? How do we think about building our plan and probably specifically you're thinking around OpEx. I think -- and Chris can weigh in here as well. We've been very thoughtful about this as we're embarking on the year ahead. And certainly, there are people way smarter than us who were kind of predicting what will be the macroeconomic outcome over the course of time. Here's what we see. We see we're coming out of a year with record performance. We're seeing our network grow dramatically and engagement grow dramatically. And we're seeing our games used not just for entertainment, but also for social interaction and social connection. We -- so that gives us confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business over the long term. As we look back over previous times where there may have been challenged consumer spending, our industry now games specifically have actually done very, very well for two reasons. One, entertainment really is a fundamental human need. And two, the form of entertainment that we deliver is extremely high value to consumers, given that you get thousands of hours of engagement when you play one of our games. And so our expectation is that even in an environment of macro challenge that our industry now games will continue to do well. One of the other things that we have -- where we've gone back and really looked at this, though, and you study it, is you discover that companies that can invest from a position of strength going into an environment like the one seemingly we're moving into actually benefit disproportionately as you come out of that. And so I think if you take in the fact that we have a growing network, growing engagement, record performance, our games fulfill both entertainment and social interaction than if you look back in history, our industry has performed very well at times like this. And when you take the strength of our business and our ability to invest against new titles this year, as well as titles we developed for the out years, we feel like we've put ourselves in a really strong position even if we were going into a challenging macro headwind. With that being said, we have built flexibility in the plan. You should know that we will be extraordinarily disciplined around costs as we move through this. And that should there be something unforeseen to us, that we have levers in our model that will allow us to adjust. But we do believe it is behest of us to invest from a position of strength as we go into this market. Yes. And so for us, I think you finish there where we start, which is the player experience. We want to ensure that the player experience is the best possible player experience that we can provide. And that's why you've seen us kind of test various models over the course of time, some have continued and some we have stopped on the basis of really upholding the best possible player experience we can. What we've seen generally though in entertainment media and even in games, particularly in mobile games right now, you see that there is a place for advertising when done right. And there is a portion of the community that when given the choice will participate in advertising where it benefits their gameplay experience. I think we've learned some of this from Glu as we brought Glu organization, and we've seen this across the industry. And so you should expect that we would continue to kind of test different things, ensuring first and foremost, that we uphold the best possible player experience. But where there is an audience -- but given the choice we'd like to engage with advertising, they have the ability to do so, we want to make that available to them. Thank you. Let me start on the World Cup mode with FIFA. And again, in the context of live service, we're always balancing the investment of time and the investment of dollars from the community. And at any given point in time, based on what's going on in the world of that game and in this case, in the world of football and of the gameplay community, we will look to leverage new content and new events and new experiences either to drive greater engagement and provide new interesting things for players to do or it might be a monetization opportunity. You might recall the last time we did the World Cup, it was an extraordinary engagement opportunity. And I don't have the numbers at the tip of my fingers. But if I remember rightly, we brought 12 million or 13 million people back into the game who had lapsed out of the game through World Cup content and drove incredible engagement through the event and then, of course, as part of the ongoing live service, continue to grow the business over the course of time. We will think about it this year in the same context. We're always thinking about our player community and always thinking about the balance between the investment of time and the investment of dollars, all in service of a more positive and more immersive and a more entertaining player experience. In terms of the value of cross-play, I don't think we have any specific data on that yet out of FIFA. In other franchises is certainly where you get greater liquidity in the franchise and friends can play with each other across devices. That's always a good thing for players. But remember, in our FIFA experience, which has 30-plus million people playing across console and PC, it's already a highly liquid community and every platform already has more enough players to sustain the ongoing player experience. But certainly, as we think about the future of all of our franchises, we want to get to a place where the entire community can play together, and that will be part of our driver as we move forward. No. And again, we take a long view here. This is one of the great franchises in our industry, built by one of the great teams in our industry. And our expectation is that we'll continue to grow and be a really important part of our portfolio for many, many years to come. We've got incredible leadership over that team now. They're rethinking the development process from the ground up and really using kind of the Vince Zampella/Respawn model of get to the fun as quickly as possible. They've been doing thousands of updates for the community working on quality of life and really getting the core game right. I think there's still more work for us to do there, and the team is committed to doing that work for the community. And beyond that, once we get to a place where we feel like we're in the right place with the core experience and with the core game, then you should expect us to invest and grow beyond where the game is at today. Yes. Right now, I think we're looking at going into further testing at the end of May and then subject to the metrics and the data that we've seen and the engagement they see, we might look toward the end of this year, beginning of next year for a global launch. Remember, in mobile, it all really comes down to the tuning and balancing once we go into kind of that Closed Beta phase. We don't have any money in FY '23 right now against that title. So if it was to launch in the year, that would be an upside potential for us. And we want to give ourselves the opportunity to ensure that we -- the game has all the soft launch and Closed Beta that it needs in order to tune and balance. But having played the game, I can tell you, I think that we're excited for the potential. Maybe I'll start with the second one, and then we'll move back to the first one. Certainly, I think that competition for great talent has always been incredibly high in our industry, and that's no different now. When we think about hiring new talent and we talk to candidates, they really make employment decisions based on four key vectors: what is the work they're going to do; who are the people they're going to do it with, of course, what is going to be the conversation; and their opportunity to learn and grow. And as we lean into hiring, we're really leaning to all four of those vectors and try and create a culture where this is a great place to make games. We were able to hire a record numbers in FY '22, even amidst what was already a very competitive marketplace. We expect to continue hiring., I think that we've been recognized by a number of surveys as an extraordinary place to work and we've really focused on the culture of our company and ensuring that we are a great place to come and create games. That doesn't mean we won't be challenged in the marketplace. I think it's going to be more and more challenged. But so far, we have not had trouble hiring incredible talent, and we brought in some amazing new creators and people across our business, quite frankly, through FY '22. Okay. Could I just? I'll catch up with you afterwards. So that was just going to say that brings us to the end of the call today. So thanks, everyone, for your time, and we look forward to speaking to you in the next quarter."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Anita. Welcome to EA\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me on the call are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. And lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q4 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call is scheduled for Tuesday, May the 10th. As a reminder, we\u2019ll post the schedule of our entire fiscal year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company.

I hope all of you and your families and loved ones are staying healthy. Let me first say thank you to our talented teams at Electronic Arts, all 12,000 people putting so much energy every day into doing amazing things for our players. As we begin, I\u2019d also like to say a few words about John passing. John\u2019s passing was a tremendous loss for the American football community, for the sports world at large and for all of us at Electronic Arts. Through his years as a winning coach, as a beloved broadcaster, and as the pioneering namesake of our game, Coach Madden was football for tens of millions of fans. He taught us many things over nearly 35 years of partnership. Some of his most important lessons, including authenticity, are things we\u2019ve held close to EA SPORTS ever since. We feel incredibly fortunate to have been part of Coach\u2019s legacy and just as fortunate to be part of how it will live on through our future Madden NFL games. We will have more to share about how we are honoring Coach Madden in the weeks ahead and from all of us at Electronic Arts, our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with his family, friends and many, many fans.  It has been a year of outstanding growth so far in FY 2022. Q3 was a record quarter, with our live services and mobile portfolio delivering strong recurring revenue and year-over-year growth. Our franchises like Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS titles, The Sims and more have universal appeal and as we expand to more ways to play across more platforms and business models, we are growing our total players, engagement, net bookings and underlying profitability. We did have a challenge in Q3 as the launch of Battlefield 2042 did not meet expectations. Battlefield 2042 was always an ambitious game and our teams pushed to innovate across many dimensions including massive scale and 128-player matches, new modes, new dynamic gameplay and more. Developing this game with our teams working from home for nearly two years ultimately proved to be challenging. Through our processes for testing and preparation, we believed the experience was ready to be put into our players\u2019 hands. We launched with strong stability, however, as more players experienced the full game, it became clear that we are up and -- unanticipated performance issues that we would need to address. Some of the design choices we made with the game also did not resonate with everyone in our community. We are fully committed to realizing the full potential of this game and fully committed to our Battlefield fans. We have already implemented a series of major updates to the game, and there is more to be done. Players can expect meaningful updates to continue in the weeks ahead and we are shifting the first season of live service content to early summer as we work closely with our community to evolve and improve the core experience in Battlefield 2042. Despite Battlefield\u2019s miss against our expectations, with the strength of our business we are continuing to deliver record growth and performance in FY 2022. With Battlefield\u2019s performance to-date and our decision to move the first season of live service into Q1 FY 2023, so we can focus on the core experience, we have adjusted our full fiscal year net bookings guidance to $7.525 billion, which remains $225 million above our original net bookings guidance for FY 2022. On the strength of our live services, operational discipline and continuing digital transformation, we\u2019re reaffirming our full-year expectations for underlying profitability. We expect strong growth to continue in FY 2023. Looking across our portfolio, we saw continuing year-over-year growth in total players, engagement, net bookings, cash flow and underlying profitability in Q3. I\u2019ll touch on each of those pieces here. Beginning with total players, our games and experiences connect a global player network that continues to scale. Over the last year, our network has grown to more than 540 million unique active accounts, across more than 18 games and 25 live services, spanning all major platforms from consoles to PC to mobile and cloud. From an engagement standpoint, more players are spending more time in our titles. Looking across our portfolio on all platforms, we\u2019ve had more than 180 million monthly active accounts on average in our games during FY 2022. Apex Legends monthly active players are up more than 30% year-over-year in Q3, and across our combined EA SPORTS portfolio, monthly active players are also growing year-over-year. Engagement is deepening as well, with players spending nearly 20% more time in games across our portfolio in FY 2022 compared to the previous year.  Growth in our network and engagement continues to drive growth in our business. With our top franchises delivering strong recurring revenue, our net bookings for Q3 grew 7.4% year-over-year for the quarter and for the full year we project 22% growth in net bookings over last year. Performance across the business and operational discipline also continued to deliver strong cash flow and underlying profitability growth in Q3. This continuing growth is anchored by proven franchises where we have a strong track record for execution. Apex Legends is now one of the biggest and most successful ongoing live services in the industry and is built on our owned IP. With more than 28 million new players joining in the last year and new seasons and in-game events that continue to deliver new experiences to a deeply engaged community, FY 2022 is the biggest year yet for Apex. Average player investment in the game has grown significantly year-over-year and we expect to achieve -- and we continue to expect net bookings for Apex to approach $1 billion in FY 2022. We are expanding to reach more players and viewers, with new original content on the way, our growing Apex Legends esports ecosystem, and Apex Legends Mobile which will soon be moving into soft launch as we continue our worldwide rollout. We\u2019ve had strong engagement and community feedback during closed beta testing and we\u2019re excited for more players to experience Apex Legends Mobile soon. Mobile is a core growth engine for us, and it is accelerating. With new launches and acquired expertise and technologies leveraged across our portfolio, we expect mobile to be a major catalyst in FY 2023 with growth well into double digits. Led by Apex Mobile, our newly-updated FIFA Mobile game, Golf Clash and more unannounced projects, we are expanding our portfolio of more than 15 top mobile live services to reach new audiences and grow our recurring revenue. EA SPORTS is a powerhouse in the sports and entertainment world. We\u2019ve driven hundreds of millions of dollars in net bookings growth year-to-date, with our EA SPORTS business up nearly 10% year-over-year. We continue to see incredible growth for the future of global soccer and our global soccer franchise was the number one title in the western world in calendar 2021. Madden NFL 22 was the number one sports title in the U.S. during the holiday period and it was the number three top selling game in the U.S. for all of last year. Under our leadership, F1 2021 also continues to perform well above expectations with unit sales nearly doubling year-over-year during the holiday period. In our mobile sports portfolio, we just launched the latest version of our EA SPORTS FIFA Mobile game around the world. This was the biggest update to the game ever and early performance has been exceptional. Engagement is up more than 50% over the previous season and retention in the first week is nearly double. With the added expertise of Playdemic and Glu, and a deep pipeline of new sports experiences in development, EA SPORTS continues to be an exceptional growth business, built on predictable and recurring revenue with outstanding opportunities ahead. Our pipeline further amplifies our strength. In addition to our core franchises, we are building new experiences in some of the biggest enduring IP in entertainment. Last week we announced a new agreement with Disney & Lucasfilm Games to develop new experiences in the Star Wars universe, continuing our collaboration of more than a decade. Respawn is leading development of the next game in our action-adventure Star Wars Jedi series, as well as two additional Star Wars titles. This adds to our deep pipeline of announced and unannounced projects with our wholly-owned IP, including Need for Speed, our BioWare franchises, The Sims, Skate, Dead Space and more. Looking forward, we are continuing to build on the structural advantages of our portfolio and accelerating growth by executing against our core strategy. We are focused on creating amazing games and content, providing creation tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences, aggregating and distributing our content and experiences to more players on more platforms, more geographies and business models, and harnessing the power of social ecosystems in and around our games. The demand for amazing games and new ways to play, watch, share and create has never been stronger. As one of the industry\u2019s largest and most profitable businesses with strong recurring revenue, we are well-positioned to take advantage of this continued secular growth. We look forward to delivering against these opportunities through FY 2023 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was a quarter that demonstrated the strength of our live services portfolio. Despite a tough Battlefield launch, we came within a couple of percent of our net bookings guidance and beat our expectations for underlying profitability. The quarter was the largest in our company\u2019s history for net bookings, underlying profitability and cash generation. Sales of Battlefield 2042 were disappointing, but they are offset by a strong showing from FIFA and continued strength from Apex and our other franchises. We delivered net revenue of $1.79 billion and net bookings of $2.58 billion. FIFA 2022\u2019s strong start continued into this quarter, with unit sales now up double-digits over last year, launch to-date and players continued to engage in FIFA Ultimate Team and invest in their teams. This has made it the strongest FIFA launch ever measured from launch to the end of Q3. Apex Legends that split net, excuse me, net bookings continue to grow at an extraordinary rate and will deliver close to a $1 billion for the year. Digital represented 64% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 2 percentage points from last year. The strong digital mix for full game sales, aided by growth in live services, pushed underlying Q3 gross margin 2.3 percentage points above last year. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in below our expectations, driven by variable compensation and savings and phasing of marketing spend. It\u2019s worth noting that we were able to hire more people than in any other quarter in our history and are continuing to invest in our games teams. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP net revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.844 billion and earnings per share of $2.43, up from our original expectation of $1.34. We are taking our net bookings guidance for the year to $7.525 billion. Although $100 million reduction on our position at the end of Q2, it is $225 million above our original guidance for the year. The reduction is driven by Battlefield 2042 in both Q3 and Q4, but offset by strength in the rest of the business, particularly in FIFA and Apex Legends. We\u2019re committed to turning Battlefield around and building a sustainable live service, even if some of the actions we\u2019re taking, like moving the first Season into FY 2023, impact net bookings in the short-term. Reflecting the strength of our portfolio, our operating cash flow guidance is now $1.900 billion. This would be close to the largest full year operating cash flow in the company\u2019s history, despite nearly $200 million of one-time tax payments related to acquisitions this year. With capital expenditures still around $200 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.700 billion. Note that this is $200 million above our original expectations for FY 2022 free cash flow. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.  For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.759 billion, cost of revenue to be $404 million and operating expenses of $1.086 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.46 for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $1.761 billion. This would be our largest Q4 ever, even if we only count organic growth. We\u2019ll formally guide FY 2023 in May, when we report Q4, but we\u2019ve heard that some of you are concerned that the Battlefield performance might impact next year\u2019s growth. Let me emphasize here again that we are a portfolio company. As originally forecast, the Battlefield franchise would have accounted for significantly less than 10% of this year\u2019s net bookings and well below 5% of next year\u2019s. We\u2019re revising those numbers, but you can see it has little impact on FY 2023 growth. The main drivers of growth next year remain FIFA on console, Apex Legends, Apex Mobile and FIFA Mobile. Golf Clash will also contribute to year-on-year growth, since we acquired Playdemic halfway through the year. With regards to new launches in FY 2023, we\u2019ve disclosed that Need for Speed is on the slate and we\u2019ll announce more titles closer to the time. In total, we still expect mid-to-high single-digit growth next year. To summarize, we just delivered the largest quarter in the company\u2019s history. FIFA goes from strength-to-strength. Apex Legends continues to show extraordinary growth. Battlefield disappointed, but our broad portfolio of games and live services insulates us from the impact of any one title. Our portfolio approaches -- approach enables us to deliver double-digit organic growth this year and continue to deliver strong cash flow, and provides a strong foundation for growth as we look to the future. Now before I hand the call to Andrew, you may have notice that yesterday we have a new CFO for the company and I think the new CFO, Chris is going to be a fabulous addition and will do a much better job, probably, than I have ever done. I thank, Andrew and the team, our executive, as well as the entire company for the amazing partnership that I have had here for nine and a half years at EA. It has been the most enjoyable experience of my entire career. I also thank the buying side and sell side analysts and partners for all of their support over the years and wonderful interaction. And last but not least, been Chris Evenden, Eric Green [ph] and Fabiola for their amazing IR performance that interacts with all of you. So, now, I\u2019ll hand the back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. These are exciting times in our industry. Interactive entertainment continues to grow by every measure and our audiences are expanding and diversifying, major franchises are at the center of culture and entertainment, and the world is recognizing how games have the power to connect global communities. Our focus continues to be on our people, our players, on our amazing portfolio of games, content and services, and extraordinary growth opportunities in the future. Thanks to our incredibly talented teams at Electronic Arts, we are delivering entertainment to hundreds of millions of people around the world and connecting them through some of the most powerful and enduring franchises. With the breadth and depth of our business that continues to expand our network, deepen engagement, and drive growth in our recurring net bookings and ongoing profitability, we are well-positioned and strategically -- well-positioned strategically to continue building on our success and delivering for our players. As we look ahead and Blake just referenced, we were excited to announce yesterday that Chris Suh is joining Electronic Arts as our next CFO. Chris is coming to us after more than 25 years at Microsoft, where he served as Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Cloud and AI group, which he led with incredible success during Microsoft\u2019s transformation to a cloud-first company. We have a big vision for the future, and in addition to Chris\u2019 financial leadership of our organization, I look forward to having him as a strategic partner with extensive experience driving scale and growth to help us achieve our goals. As we announced previously, Blake will be leaving our team after nearly a decade of leadership at EA. Blake has been an incredible leader, partner and advisor. But most importantly, he is a dear friend and I feel deeply grateful for our time working together. His expertise and the team he has built have been instrumental in our growth and financial achievements, and have positioned us well for continued success. Blake will remain with us until the summer to assist with the transition and special projects. Thank you, Blake, for everything you\u2019ve done and continue to do for our company, and again, thank you for your friendship. Now, we are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Just a quick thank you to Blake for being a great partner and looking forward to meeting Chris. Two questions. So, first, just around Battlefield, can you guys sort of frame for us how you think about the vision for the future of that franchise, and in particular, how the new leadership for the Battlefield you are just thinking about expanding and adapting that franchise over time? And I\u2019ve got a second question.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Great question. Again, we have a very bold vision for where this franchise go. This franchise has always led the category in creativity, innovation, scale, gameplay, community. And as we are coming to launch, again, we had a very bold vision for this game. As it turns out, we\u2019ve had some challenges, not least of all, trying to build this game and provide this game from home, and so our focus now is really making sure that core experience lives up to our fans, the community\u2019s expectations. Beyond that we\u2019ll continue to invest and grow the franchise, we have great leadership with Vince and Byron, and others, with tremendous background from other great shooters in the industry, kind of leading the future. I believe that we\u2019re going to see this game do really well over the course of time. I think we\u2019ll expand to mobile. We will expand to other new interesting ways to play. But certainly this is just a moment where we take a pause and do all we can for the core game and the core community.\nBenjamin Soff: Got it. And then, just in light of the announcement that you guys are working on those three new Star Wars games. Can you talk a little bit more about your vision for that IP? And is it fair to say that going forward, you\u2019re planning to lean more towards investing in your own IP? And if so, what are the like some of the potential pros and cons of that as a strategy? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. The very strength of our business is our balanced portfolio. We have both a deep and a broad portfolio. And what we\u2019ve demonstrated over the course of our, the best part of 40 years is to really develop both our own IP over time, the Need for Speed, The Sims, Battlefield, Apex Legends, our BioWare franchises, we have Skate in development now, Dead Space on the way, so an incredible portfolio of own IP that has an extraordinary following across the industry. Combined with other long-term enduring IP, we have the powerhouse sports franchises. And they are true evergreen franchises and this is not just about licensing content. This is about working with over 300 partners across the various sports industries to deliver a true connection with the sports, the leagues, the teams, the players that our fans love. And we\u2019ve been doing that now for well over 30 years and I think that we will continue to do that for many, many years in the future. And things like the Star Wars franchise, again, a long-term relationship we\u2019ve had with Disney for more than a decade. And this is not simply about building or revisiting things that already exist in the universe, but really adding to that Star Wars universe and really delivering new opportunities for Star Wars fans to experience great Star Wars content. And so as you think about our strategy going forward and the strength of our company, it really comes down to our ability to develop and build and publish industry-leading owned IP, but also work with partners over decades to truly deliver fan favorites with long and enduring fan bases, like, our Sports franchises and like Disney.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Hey. Thanks. Thanks for taking the call and just reiterate the positive sentiment from Blake. Blake is doing a great run. Really enjoyed it. I guess I just had really one question. No follow up. You\u2019re -- one of your bigger competitors was just taken out. You guys have quite a good portfolio and have taken a portfolio approach for years. How do you think the industry will look in three years or four years? Do you guys see yourself as a consolidator of potential seller? How do you see this industry shaking out over the next three years to five years? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Great question. And you should imagine we read this for some time as it turns out and part of the reason why we have built the strength in our broad and deep portfolio and why we have gone out in search of the best teams in the industry to bring them into our company and build great entertainment for our global player base, what is now well over 0.5 billion fans, is because we do believe in the power of entertainment. We just believe in the power of interactive entertainment. I think what we\u2019re seeing now in the marketplace is the launching of the value of what we do in particular. And so, as I think about the attainment coming together, you\u2019re seeing some other companies talk about this. But when we think about our players and we think about the things that they engage in, they play our games more than any other form of entertainment, but they also consume linear media and scripted entertainment and sports broadcasts, and music and other things. And so, as we look at the future, we are building strength in our whole ability to live interactive entertainment to our fans, which we think will continue to grow well north of a 1 billion fans over time. But we\u2019re also aware that our fans are expecting us to find new and interesting ways for them to experience entertainment. And so, as our -- as we think about the future, you should think about it with IP at the center and engagement around play, watch, creep, social ecosystem that brings that they love. And when you look at our strategy of what we\u2019re doing around in great -- creating great entertainment, around building tools, so that now community can engage more deeply, around the aggregation and distribution of content across platforms, across business models, across geographies, and really leaning into the social ecosystem to the board out of engagement in our games, I think you should imagine that\u2019s what the world look [Technical Difficulty]\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark. Your line is now open.\nMike Hickey: Hey, Andrew, Blake, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. And Blake, I\u2019m going to miss you buddy. I am sure you would be getting a lot of skin and so I\u2019m not feeling sorry for you. But it\u2019s been great working with you, so. Question is, I guess, on Battlefield, obviously, disappointed. Can you give us -- can you size the units you sold in the quarter? I think you\u2019ve guided for 12 or so, but just sort of curious where you ended up versus expectations? And then thinking about how you sort of re-engage that audience. There\u2019s been some ideas around beta play, curious about the possibility? And then I didn\u2019t hear mobile, have you got mobile for Battlefield or is that just delayed? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Sure. Let me -- Mike, thanks for your nice comment to the other analysts as well. Unfortunately, I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t get as much skin as I would like. But we\u2019re going to refrain from trying to give updates there. Remember, Battlefield is less than 10% of our revenue. We sold less units than we thought we would. But what I would say is that, remember these [Technical Difficulty] and so our goal is to add new excitement to stretch this out. And in some ways, we hoped it benefits FY 2023 since we\u2019ve had a pretty strong FY 2022 and so it helps us in the future. I\u2019ll let Andrew address the second part of your question.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. So, I think that, you remember coming into the launch, the demand measures were very high, influence for us. The core underlying created for the game still has really strong demand around it. And we -- as I mentioned, we had some challenges around stability, particularly on high end PC machines and performance and there were some design decisions, but not all the community really agreed with. And so our focus right now is to really go back in and make sure we get that stuff right. And as much as I hate to admit it, DICE\u2019s the studio that has been able to do this a number of times now and really go back and rebuild at the core and reengage the community, as long as we do that in conjunction with a committee. That\u2019s what that studio was so great at doing. So I think the combination of DICE with the new leadership and a strong vision for the future, we will build out the core, we will reengage the community and we will manifest that demand that we saw coming into launch over the course of time. Mobile is still developing, the metrics are showing up really strong. I think, right now we\u2019re looking at going into the next closed beta at the end of this month, and as is the case of mobile, we need to choose and test in the environment. And then as it relates to free-to-play and other modes of play, again we have a big bold vision for this franchise. This franchise since its inception has been a leader in creativity and innovation was how it\u2019s played and how it\u2019s delivered. And you should expect that we will continue to work to deliver new and interesting ways to engage with this game over the course of time. And while I\u2019m disappointed with how it launched, I\u2019m still very excited for the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon and thanks for the question. Andrew, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about when you think about the expansion that\u2019s going on in the video games industry in the last year or so and we\u2019re seeing a lot of user-generated content and platforms around that start to proliferate. We\u2019ve seen a lot of venture capital funding into blockchain and NFT gaming, wondering how you\u2019re thinking about those channels eventually and it\u2019s easier to build from within? Is it better to buy once there\u2019s some established players there? Just want to get your mindset there.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Great question. I will tell you, I started this industry over 20 years ago. At that point in time it was the fastest growing entertainment industry on the planet by a wide margin. I think it has been the fastest growing entertainment industry on the planet every year since then. But still people seem to be surprised by this. So we\u2019re not surprised by it at all, and I think, as technology has continued to evolve, we have been able to deliver new and interesting and fun ways to engage with content. And what we\u2019ve seen more recently is just how powerful the social ecosystem, the social networks bought out of engagement in our games truly are amazing. Now -- it\u2019s not now just about ingesting entertainment the same way we do traditional scripted media or traditional broadcasters, usual music. This is about experiencing entertainment with your friends and that\u2019s unbelievably powerful. I think that has been really the fuel that has driven the growth in recent time. As part of that, of course, the ability to create your own content and put it into that ecosystem has become a really valuable part of, of what our industry offers to our players and our fans. The traditional media just doesn\u2019t and this is something that we hold true. Again, it\u2019s been at the very center of The Sims for a long time. It\u2019s at the very center of mode like FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team, to the very center of the design of Skate, which we\u2019ll be launching soon. And so this concept of UGC or user-generated content is really just an extension of the social interaction that I\u2019m able to have with my friends in and around experiencing what is the best anytime on the planet. And so I believe that\u2019s going to be a really important part of our future. Now, to the extent whether we want to build that out or buy out over time, right now we are building, we\u2019re building technology, we\u2019re building credit, we\u2019re building assets with we\u2019re offering that out to communities around the world and we\u2019re seeing great uptake of that. If there was an acquisition opportunity in the future, we would openly look at that, but we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not looking at anything at this juncture. Around the NFT and where VCs are investing, again we see this also happened our industry. We start with 3D, we start with AR/VR, we\u2019re now seeing with MCs. There\u2019s always something in and around our industry that is driving a lot of external investment. The way I look at this is, collectability is really built on four key metrics. It\u2019s around high quality content, it\u2019s around scarcity, it\u2019s around proof-of-authenticity and it\u2019s around a group of people that find value in that content. And we\u2019ve seen that happen in the real world and we\u2019ve seen that happen in a virtual world. We\u2019ve certainly seen that happen in and around our games for some number of years. And I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players. Whether that\u2019s part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we\u2019re going to -- we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re driving audience.\nEric Handler: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey. Good afternoon, Andrew and Blake absolute best of luck to you and your future endeavors here. It\u2019s been a pleasure. I guess two questions. First for me, you got to talk about in the back half of the fiscal year, obviously, Battlefield missed. That\u2019s partially offset by strengthen in FIFA, Apex and others. With FIFA, in particular, I guess, you talked a lot about kind of unit strength year-on-year? I\u2019m just kind of curious how you felt about or are feeling about your Ultimate Team and the live services component into the back half of the year? I guess, it\u2019s first question. Second question, I am curious, you are coming back to mobile, and maybe some of the recent acquisitions, kind of curious if you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about advertising, I know, it\u2019s come up a bit, other companies might get 10% to 20% of their mobile bookings from advertising, Glu brings some new capabilities, I am curious how you are thinking about advertising, I am curious how you\u2019re thinking about the Glu pipeline, you have almost a year into that deal. And then also, when we might start to hear a little more about kind of what your plans are with Metalhead and Super Mega baseball? Thanks guys.\nBlake Jorgensen: So let me -- I\u2019ll start on the live service piece and then I will let Andrew hit the second question. Live service growth in the quarter was 9% and trailing 12 months is 21%, and that\u2019s across all of our live services. And so, if you look at something like Apex or FIFA, they\u2019re clearly well north of that. And we feel -- continue to feel it is one of the cores of our business, because it is reoccurring and highly dependent on the social networks that we\u2019ve created in our games, and particularly, on sports, those are evergreen networks that continue every year. And so the metrics we see are exceptional up well over last year. If you look at the Apex numbers, as we reported, the dramatic improvement year-over-year and everything they do is continuing to try to drive engagement with people that brought a large number of new players into the game or obtained players and continue to come up with amazing and unique ideas for ways to play. So we\u2019re very excited about how that continues and it continues across all of our sports, and we\u2019re looking as to how do we do that across more and more games going forward. So I\u2019ll let Andrew talk about Glu a little bit.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Again, we are working closely with Glu. It is still relatively early days with the acquisition for both them and Playdemic, and we are working both on bolstering our existing 15 live services and building out new ones. And as per my prepared remarks, we\u2019re projecting well into double-digit growth next year and that includes Apex Mobile and renewed FIFA Mobile, and a full year of Golf Clash and ongoing growth across the portfolio and we\u2019re excited about that. With respect to advertising, specifically, we are taking the Glu advertising stack and applying it across our games. And it\u2019s little early to know just yet exactly how that will manifest, but based on what we are seeing across the industry, we expect that that represents some revenue growth there also. So, overall, mobile now really is a strength of ours. It\u2019s a very important part of how we drive growth in the business, both in our existing games, in our new launches and with the potential of mobile advertising across the portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDrew Crum: Okay. Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon, and Blake, best of luck. I am Curious as to your thoughts on where the businesses in terms of engagement normalizing? Is the reopening headwind behind you or is this something we should anticipate in calendar 2022? Is it contemplated in their fiscal 2023 net bookings forecast? And then, separately, your OpEx growth year-to-date is approaching 30% year-on-year? Should we see that slow materially once you start to anniversary acquisitions or how should we be thinking about OpEx going forward? Thanks.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. I can take the OpEx question quickly, Drew. I mean, clearly, most of that was driven by two things; one is, our acquisitions, probably, the biggest driver of it; but second is, driven by the fact that we\u2019ve used this opportunity of some questions in the gamer community about which companies are going to be around and which aren\u2019t, and we\u2019ve been able to hire some amazing talent during that because of our stability. And so that doesn\u2019t continue on forever. Obviously, the acquisition growth is a one-time component, sorry. So, I think, we\u2019re -- remember our OpEx is really comes down on two things, headcount and marketing expense. So the marketing expense will swing by the titles that are in any one year, but we\u2019re pretty good at managing that. And the headcount we\u2019re also very good at managing and so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a jump like we\u2019ve seen this past year. But remember, even with the OpEx growth that you see, look at the Q3 EPS number. I mean, clearly, we\u2019ve been able to manage that even with a downdraft of $48 million in revenue that we didn\u2019t originally plan. And so we\u2019re a pretty flexible organization to be able to try to manage that to keep margins going and so I think you\u2019ll see that going forward.\nAndrew Wilson: On engagement through or post-COVID, depending on how you think about it, I think we\u2019ve been on a rolling situation around the world of kind of coming back and shaved down a little and coming back. Broadly speaking, though, much of the world is out and about, they\u2019re at sporting events, they go into theme parks, they\u2019re watching movies, they\u2019re going to dinner. So much of the world has returned mostly to normal at this juncture by our calculation. Even as part of that we\u2019ve seen not only number of players grow, again, over 540 million people now on our network, we\u2019ve also seen time spent in our games grow by over 20%. And I kind of look to that as not just about creating amazing games, entertainment, but it is the social interaction. I think what COVID has taught us is that games are a great way not just to get our entertainment fixed, to remain deeply connected with our friends and fans and rivals. And what we\u2019re seeing now, I believe, is actually the long-term effect of the discovery of not just the value of our of what we do in terms of entertainment, but also the value in maintaining connections with those we care most about and we would expect that to continue and actually create a flywheel for added growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. I think it\u2019s a little bit early to talk about this. But I would be very curious about how you\u2019re thinking about your business and strategies that relates to the metaverse as that becomes more real. Is that something that you view is just another opportunity for you to engage your fans? Is it a battle about time span? Is it potentially sort of change industry, sort of rev shares or is it just sort of a non-event and you guys think you can sort of continue to focus on your IP and engagement and it\u2019s really sort of not material? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. I mean a great question and certainly another one of these things that is kind of a topic gives you at the moment and many people are talking about it in different contexts, quite frankly. At the end of the day, the metaverse is a three dimensional social space where you come together to experience things with your friends. And so now much of that happens in the two dimensional internet around the social networks that we see. But I will tell you, a lot of that happens in the context of our games. And as I look at the nature of our games, I look at the engagement that we\u2019re seeing inside these 3D spaces that we create in and around sports and other worlds. What you see with our industry is the beginnings of what a metaverse might be. And over the course of time, you should expect us to continue to expand and extend the world that we have been creating for the last 30 years and deliver more experiences beyond the core consider the game. So what can you do in FIFA beyond playing football? What were you doing Need for Speed beyond driving the game? What will you do in The Sims as you come together with your friends beyond the creation of content? And you\u2019ll see that continue to evolve for us over the course of time. And I don\u2019t know ultimately what the metaverse will become. But what I do know is the games we create are becoming more important as social spaces and they are just as places to enjoy great entertainment as we continue to build out those experiences and as whatever the metaverse becomes it\u2019s an almost certainty that we will play a very important role in it and that our players will be on the leading edge of the evolution of what these spaces might become.\nJason Bazinet: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nMike Ng: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about EA Play, where are we with EA Play subscriber today and how do you see the outlook for video games description services changing particularly with recent consolidation? And then, second, it was encouraging to hear the reiteration of the mid-to-high single-digit topline growth for next year? I was wondering if you could go a little bit more in detail around some of the drivers. What do you see driving some of the FIFA trends and are there new games or unannounced titles embedded in that outlook? Thank you very much.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Let me quickly hit on the EA Play component and then I\u2019ll let Blake talk about the mid-to-high single-digit growth. EA Pay continues to grow for us. It continues to be a really, really positive consumer experience, getting access to some of the greatest content in the industry. What we see more broadly across entertainment is its subscription continues to be a core driver. And what we\u2019re able to do is drive ongoing engagement, perhaps, in a way, even it -- the stronger than traditional linear or scripted entertainment. I think that you\u2019ll -- we will continue to see consumers engage in our content through subscription and we will continue to provide our content that way and I think we\u2019ll start to see more and more growth across platform. We continue to be the leading provider of a gaming subscription across platforms in our industry, and with the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the new experiences we have coming. We believe that we\u2019re going to continue to drive growth. And over the course of time back to my earlier point around entertainment, you might expect us to do more things beyond just games in the context of that subscription around a broader service for our clients and we\u2019re pretty excited about what that might become over the course of time.\nBlake Jorgensen: And on the 2023 question, obviously, as we said, we\u2019re not yet ready to give guidance, which we normally don\u2019t do at this time of the year, but we did give some hints. And the keys to driving growth are obviously our core portfolio, things like FIFA, for example, and live services is associated with it, bat and hockey and other sports. Apex Legends, obviously, has continued to evolve and show an amazing growth. We will have an Apex Legends Mobile game in the market. We don\u2019t know exactly what time that will be and there\u2019ll be a global build for that game, as well as the Chinese build for that game. And we\u2019re working with a partner there and things are going very well in test, but we\u2019re excited about that as a major growth driver. We will have more growth we think out of the FIFA Mobile game that we just put into the market. And remember that we only had our book, really a half of year of Playdemic Golf Clash game. We\u2019ll have a full year event next year. And we\u2019re working with Playdemic on how they can take that Clash mechanic into other sports areas where we have licenses already. And then we\u2019ve got a Need for Speed game coming and there are three or four more things to that we haven\u2019t announced yet, but you can imagine we are always trying to find ways to grow the portfolio year-over-year through new titles, new IP and expansion. And as well, acquisitions, which right now we\u2019re in the digest mode, but doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t keep looking at everything going forward. So we\u2019re excited about next year. It looks like a strong year to come. And as Andrew said, we know that this is one of the greatest entertainment vehicles in the world right now until we\u2019re really in the sweet spot and that\u2019s what gets us excited about it.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you both. Sounds incredibly helpful. And Blake, best of luck in your next chapter.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, and Blake, it\u2019s been a pleasure interacting with you over the years.\nBlake Jorgensen: I appreciate that.\nMario Lu: Yeah. I guess the first question is more high level. You guys said in your slides. Spending -- playing time is increased 20% this quarter compared to the year prior? What was the largest driver of that and I don\u2019t know if you have this data, but what\u2019s the typical lag historically between growth and time span and monetization? And then, secondly, you guys did not really talk about Madden as much on this call. So just wondering what the delta is between it performance versus like a FIFA. Are things, like, maybe unpack something what\u2019s kind of driving the growth here, anything out of Madden that you can talk about? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. So let me start with Madden. Madden is also having a great year and we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth. As you know and then for all of you who follow the season, this has been an unbelievably exciting season of football and what we know\u2026\nBlake Jorgensen: 49ers. Yeah.\nAndrew Wilson: \u2026and let\u2019s -- well, and what\u2019s exciting for a second, the playoff games and the season overall has been an unbelievably exciting game. The ratings for the NFL have been extremely strong through the year and that\u2019s driving really strong engagement in and around our Madden franchise and it continues to go from strength-to-strength.\nBlake Jorgensen: With respect to what drove engagement, again, we have this great portfolio and while we certainly saw extraordinary growth in Apex Legends, we saw a great growth in FIFA. We also saw growth across the portfolio. And on -- Apex was 30%, FIFA was our esports portfolio was up 10% on what is a very big number. But we\u2019ve seen growth across the portfolio that speaks to the value of the breadth and the depth of our portfolios. In terms of lag between engagement and monetization growth, which I think was one part of your question there. I don\u2019t have exact numbers for you on that. What I would say is our teams work very closely with the communities and ensure that they\u2019re always providing new and interesting content. And what we know about all of our communities they play and they make a choice of do they want to invest more time or do they want to invest more money in the experience and it\u2019s really the ability to build that balanced ecosystem that speaks to the strength of our live services over time. And so it\u2019s a very symbiotic relationship that happens between the investment of time and investment money over the course of the experience and our teams have become very, very good at that and work very, very closely with their communities to drive it.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. And one thing, I just remind everybody, and we may have already said this, but I\u2019ll say it again. We shipped last year order due to the pandemic. We delayed it three weeks to move it into the third [Tech Difficulty] this year and the second quarter. So when you look at the growth of the third quarter, knowing that that didn\u2019t include the initial shift in a FIFA, it\u2019s almost hard to believe the strength of the business. And so I just want our people not to forget that and we\u2019re not going to provide numbers or details around that exactly, but just know that the situation we are having moved [Technical Difficulty] back to the second quarter. It\u2019s pretty impressive.\nMario Lu: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Marok: Thanks for taking my questions and wanted to pass my best wishes on to Blake as well. On Apex Legends, so season 12 seems like a more substantial content drop than the typical season. So whether it\u2019s amount of content or type of content, is there anything that particularly stands out as a driver for new player acquisition and engagement, whether it\u2019s game modes, new maps or things like that? And then second on FIFA, around the growth in unit sales year-over-year? I guess, at this point, who was interested in FIFA 2022 that maybe wasn\u2019t in FIFA 2021? Are there any particular markets or customer segments that saw solid unit growth? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Well, some detailed questions and the great question. So thank you. On Apex, again, as we -- as the teams put together these seasons of content and they think about that new content, a new modality to play, a new ways to connect. Remember, Apex is now well over 100 million clients. So there\u2019s no one size fits all component that really attracts new players or engages any broad group of players deeply. I think what the esports team and the Apex team in particular have been able to demonstrate is they work very close with their community. They deeply engage with their community and they are delivering content modalities, applying maps, these things that really speak to what the community are asking for and what we\u2019ve seen since the very beginning of the launch of this game is them being able to work in a very calculated way around the delivery of really interesting new content, new maps and new models apply on a season by season basis that has continued to grow the overall player base, continue to grow the overall experience, continue to grow the engagement that play base has with the experience and the investment those players are making as part of their engagement. And so we\u2019re very excited about that.\nBlake Jorgensen: And then, with respect to FIFA, again, this is another team that has demonstrated the power of working very closely with the community in and around a live service. Football, soccer, as we call it in this country continues to grow the leagues, the teams, the players are going from strength-to-strength in popularity. As -- we have over 300 licenses in the game and answering the partners that we work with in the provision of what is a growing, broadening, deepening experience for our player base. And as the world of football grows, as we build our fan base, again, if you think about the fan base we have for our product or our service, it\u2019s the largest digital football club in the world with well over 100 million fans and we work very close with that fan base around their ability to experience football in a way that\u2019s most meaningful to them, around their league, around their teams, around the plays and love. And the reason we are always continued to drive growth in and around that franchise is because we do work very closely with our global community of fans and we are delivering them again, content gameplay modalities of play that is most interesting and most exciting to them, and connects them most deeply with the sport they love and the fans they love it with.\nAndrew Marok: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next -- okay. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDoug Creutz: Hey. Thank you. Cloud+ dropped a pretty expensive looking halo trailer over the weekend and Netflix has had some success with The Witcher and League of Legends on their streaming service. There\u2019s absolutely ravenous demand for content right now from 0.5 dozen or so streaming services. And you guys have some IP particularly within BioWare that I think would be pretty good as a basis for show. Are we finally at a point where video game IP has some meaningful transmedia opportunities or do you think that\u2019s still more theory than a reality?\nAndrew Wilson: No. I think what -- based on exactly what you just said and what we\u2019ve experienced, there is -- video game IP or interactive entertainment IP is now some of the most culturally relevant IP in all of entertainment and I think that\u2019s going to continue to grow. When you think about hundreds of millions of fans engaging in and around the IP we create, like, Apex, like, The Sims, like Need for Speed, like, our BioWare franchises, like, Dead Space, like, Skate. It\u2019s not a natural to that to spawn kind of a scripted entertainment element. I think traditionally, the scripted entertainment elements in our industry have not been big revenue drivers themselves. But where there have been a high quality, they\u2019ve lifted the overall engagement the franchise more deeply, so there\u2019s kind of a one, two punch that drives growth in the business. I think as we think about our future, we do believe that this thing that we do that is interactive entertainment is becoming more and more important on a daily basis to all things, and that our fans are going to want to experience that in many different modalities and some of that might be scripted entertainment in nature. And you should expect that the way we\u2019re looking at any and all aspects that allow us to expand and expand our brands for our fan base. But we\u2019re doing it very thoughtfully, and again, as part of our strategy doing it profitably.\nDoug Creutz: Great. Thanks, Andrew, and best wishes, Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Doug. Look, I think, that\u2019s the last question. I appreciate everyone\u2019s [Technical Difficulty] support us and I\u2019ll be around for a while and make sure that we get our new CFO fully on board, and as I said, he will be much better than me. So everyone stay healthy and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Q3 was a quarter that demonstrated the strength of our live services portfolio. Despite a tough Battlefield launch, we came within a couple of percent of our net bookings guidance and beat our expectations for underlying profitability. The quarter was the largest in our company's history for net bookings, underlying profitability and cash generation. Sales of Battlefield 2042 were disappointing, but they are offset by a strong showing from FIFA and continued strength from Apex and our other franchises. We delivered net revenue of $1.79 billion and net bookings of $2.58 billion. FIFA 2022's strong start continued into this quarter, with unit sales now up double-digits over last year, launch to-date and players continued to engage in FIFA Ultimate Team and invest in their teams. This has made it the strongest FIFA launch ever measured from launch to the end of Q3. Apex Legends that split net, excuse me, net bookings continue to grow at an extraordinary rate and will deliver close to a $1 billion for the year. Digital represented 64% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 2 percentage points from last year. The strong digital mix for full game sales, aided by growth in live services, pushed underlying Q3 gross margin 2.3 percentage points above last year. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in below our expectations, driven by variable compensation and savings and phasing of marketing spend. It's worth noting that we were able to hire more people than in any other quarter in our history and are continuing to invest in our games teams. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP net revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.844 billion and earnings per share of $2.43, up from our original expectation of $1.34. We are taking our net bookings guidance for the year to $7.525 billion. Although $100 million reduction on our position at the end of Q2, it is $225 million above our original guidance for the year. The reduction is driven by Battlefield 2042 in both Q3 and Q4, but offset by strength in the rest of the business, particularly in FIFA and Apex Legends. We're committed to turning Battlefield around and building a sustainable live service, even if some of the actions we're taking, like moving the first Season into FY 2023, impact net bookings in the short-term. Reflecting the strength of our portfolio, our operating cash flow guidance is now $1.900 billion. This would be close to the largest full year operating cash flow in the company's history, despite nearly $200 million of one-time tax payments related to acquisitions this year. With capital expenditures still around $200 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.700 billion. Note that this is $200 million above our original expectations for FY 2022 free cash flow. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information.  For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.759 billion, cost of revenue to be $404 million and operating expenses of $1.086 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.46 for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 fiscal 2022 net bookings to be $1.761 billion. This would be our largest Q4 ever, even if we only count organic growth. We'll formally guide FY 2023 in May, when we report Q4, but we've heard that some of you are concerned that the Battlefield performance might impact next year's growth. Let me emphasize here again that we are a portfolio company. As originally forecast, the Battlefield franchise would have accounted for significantly less than 10% of this year's net bookings and well below 5% of next year's. We're revising those numbers, but you can see it has little impact on FY 2023 growth. The main drivers of growth next year remain FIFA on console, Apex Legends, Apex Mobile and FIFA Mobile. Golf Clash will also contribute to year-on-year growth, since we acquired Playdemic halfway through the year. With regards to new launches in FY 2023, we've disclosed that Need for Speed is on the slate and we'll announce more titles closer to the time. In total, we still expect mid-to-high single-digit growth next year. To summarize, we just delivered the largest quarter in the company's history. FIFA goes from strength-to-strength. Apex Legends continues to show extraordinary growth. Battlefield disappointed, but our broad portfolio of games and live services insulates us from the impact of any one title. Our portfolio approaches -- approach enables us to deliver double-digit organic growth this year and continue to deliver strong cash flow, and provides a strong foundation for growth as we look to the future. Now before I hand the call to Andrew, you may have notice that yesterday we have a new CFO for the company and I think the new CFO, Chris is going to be a fabulous addition and will do a much better job, probably, than I have ever done. I thank, Andrew and the team, our executive, as well as the entire company for the amazing partnership that I have had here for nine and a half years at EA. It has been the most enjoyable experience of my entire career. I also thank the buying side and sell side analysts and partners for all of their support over the years and wonderful interaction. And last but not least, been Chris Evenden, Eric Green [ph] and Fabiola for their amazing IR performance that interacts with all of you. So, now, I'll hand the back to Andrew. Sure. Let me -- Mike, thanks for your nice comment to the other analysts as well. Unfortunately, I'm sure I won't get as much skin as I would like. But we're going to refrain from trying to give updates there. Remember, Battlefield is less than 10% of our revenue. We sold less units than we thought we would. But what I would say is that, remember these [Technical Difficulty] and so our goal is to add new excitement to stretch this out. And in some ways, we hoped it benefits FY 2023 since we've had a pretty strong FY 2022 and so it helps us in the future. I'll let Andrew address the second part of your question. So let me -- I'll start on the live service piece and then I will let Andrew hit the second question. Live service growth in the quarter was 9% and trailing 12 months is 21%, and that's across all of our live services. And so, if you look at something like Apex or FIFA, they're clearly well north of that. And we feel -- continue to feel it is one of the cores of our business, because it is reoccurring and highly dependent on the social networks that we've created in our games, and particularly, on sports, those are evergreen networks that continue every year. And so the metrics we see are exceptional up well over last year. If you look at the Apex numbers, as we reported, the dramatic improvement year-over-year and everything they do is continuing to try to drive engagement with people that brought a large number of new players into the game or obtained players and continue to come up with amazing and unique ideas for ways to play. So we're very excited about how that continues and it continues across all of our sports, and we're looking as to how do we do that across more and more games going forward. So I'll let Andrew talk about Glu a little bit. Yeah. I can take the OpEx question quickly, Drew. I mean, clearly, most of that was driven by two things; one is, our acquisitions, probably, the biggest driver of it; but second is, driven by the fact that we've used this opportunity of some questions in the gamer community about which companies are going to be around and which aren't, and we've been able to hire some amazing talent during that because of our stability. And so that doesn't continue on forever. Obviously, the acquisition growth is a one-time component, sorry. So, I think, we're -- remember our OpEx is really comes down on two things, headcount and marketing expense. So the marketing expense will swing by the titles that are in any one year, but we're pretty good at managing that. And the headcount we're also very good at managing and so I don't think you're going to see a jump like we've seen this past year. But remember, even with the OpEx growth that you see, look at the Q3 EPS number. I mean, clearly, we've been able to manage that even with a downdraft of $48 million in revenue that we didn't originally plan. And so we're a pretty flexible organization to be able to try to manage that to keep margins going and so I think you'll see that going forward. And on the 2023 question, obviously, as we said, we're not yet ready to give guidance, which we normally don't do at this time of the year, but we did give some hints. And the keys to driving growth are obviously our core portfolio, things like FIFA, for example, and live services is associated with it, bat and hockey and other sports. Apex Legends, obviously, has continued to evolve and show an amazing growth. We will have an Apex Legends Mobile game in the market. We don't know exactly what time that will be and there'll be a global build for that game, as well as the Chinese build for that game. And we're working with a partner there and things are going very well in test, but we're excited about that as a major growth driver. We will have more growth we think out of the FIFA Mobile game that we just put into the market. And remember that we only had our book, really a half of year of Playdemic Golf Clash game. We'll have a full year event next year. And we're working with Playdemic on how they can take that Clash mechanic into other sports areas where we have licenses already. And then we've got a Need for Speed game coming and there are three or four more things to that we haven't announced yet, but you can imagine we are always trying to find ways to grow the portfolio year-over-year through new titles, new IP and expansion. And as well, acquisitions, which right now we're in the digest mode, but doesn't mean that we won't keep looking at everything going forward. So we're excited about next year. It looks like a strong year to come. And as Andrew said, we know that this is one of the greatest entertainment vehicles in the world right now until we're really in the sweet spot and that's what gets us excited about it. Thank you. I appreciate that. 49ers. Yeah. With respect to what drove engagement, again, we have this great portfolio and while we certainly saw extraordinary growth in Apex Legends, we saw a great growth in FIFA. We also saw growth across the portfolio. And on -- Apex was 30%, FIFA was our esports portfolio was up 10% on what is a very big number. But we've seen growth across the portfolio that speaks to the value of the breadth and the depth of our portfolios. In terms of lag between engagement and monetization growth, which I think was one part of your question there. I don't have exact numbers for you on that. What I would say is our teams work very closely with the communities and ensure that they're always providing new and interesting content. And what we know about all of our communities they play and they make a choice of do they want to invest more time or do they want to invest more money in the experience and it's really the ability to build that balanced ecosystem that speaks to the strength of our live services over time.

I appreciate everyone's [Technical Difficulty] support us and I'll be around for a while and make sure that we get our new CFO fully on board, and as I said, he will be much better than me. So everyone stay healthy and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I hope all of you and your families and loved ones are staying healthy. Let me first say thank you to our talented teams at Electronic Arts, all 12,000 people putting so much energy every day into doing amazing things for our players. As we begin, I'd also like to say a few words about John passing. John's passing was a tremendous loss for the American football community, for the sports world at large and for all of us at Electronic Arts. Through his years as a winning coach, as a beloved broadcaster, and as the pioneering namesake of our game, Coach Madden was football for tens of millions of fans. He taught us many things over nearly 35 years of partnership. Some of his most important lessons, including authenticity, are things we've held close to EA SPORTS ever since. We feel incredibly fortunate to have been part of Coach's legacy and just as fortunate to be part of how it will live on through our future Madden NFL games. We will have more to share about how we are honoring Coach Madden in the weeks ahead and from all of us at Electronic Arts, our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with his family, friends and many, many fans.  It has been a year of outstanding growth so far in FY 2022. Q3 was a record quarter, with our live services and mobile portfolio delivering strong recurring revenue and year-over-year growth. Our franchises like Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS titles, The Sims and more have universal appeal and as we expand to more ways to play across more platforms and business models, we are growing our total players, engagement, net bookings and underlying profitability. We did have a challenge in Q3 as the launch of Battlefield 2042 did not meet expectations. Battlefield 2042 was always an ambitious game and our teams pushed to innovate across many dimensions including massive scale and 128-player matches, new modes, new dynamic gameplay and more. Developing this game with our teams working from home for nearly two years ultimately proved to be challenging. Through our processes for testing and preparation, we believed the experience was ready to be put into our players' hands. We launched with strong stability, however, as more players experienced the full game, it became clear that we are up and -- unanticipated performance issues that we would need to address. Some of the design choices we made with the game also did not resonate with everyone in our community. We are fully committed to realizing the full potential of this game and fully committed to our Battlefield fans. We have already implemented a series of major updates to the game, and there is more to be done. Players can expect meaningful updates to continue in the weeks ahead and we are shifting the first season of live service content to early summer as we work closely with our community to evolve and improve the core experience in Battlefield 2042. Despite Battlefield's miss against our expectations, with the strength of our business we are continuing to deliver record growth and performance in FY 2022. With Battlefield's performance to-date and our decision to move the first season of live service into Q1 FY 2023, so we can focus on the core experience, we have adjusted our full fiscal year net bookings guidance to $7.525 billion, which remains $225 million above our original net bookings guidance for FY 2022. On the strength of our live services, operational discipline and continuing digital transformation, we're reaffirming our full-year expectations for underlying profitability. We expect strong growth to continue in FY 2023. Looking across our portfolio, we saw continuing year-over-year growth in total players, engagement, net bookings, cash flow and underlying profitability in Q3. I'll touch on each of those pieces here. Beginning with total players, our games and experiences connect a global player network that continues to scale. Over the last year, our network has grown to more than 540 million unique active accounts, across more than 18 games and 25 live services, spanning all major platforms from consoles to PC to mobile and cloud. From an engagement standpoint, more players are spending more time in our titles. Looking across our portfolio on all platforms, we've had more than 180 million monthly active accounts on average in our games during FY 2022. Apex Legends monthly active players are up more than 30% year-over-year in Q3, and across our combined EA SPORTS portfolio, monthly active players are also growing year-over-year. Engagement is deepening as well, with players spending nearly 20% more time in games across our portfolio in FY 2022 compared to the previous year.  Growth in our network and engagement continues to drive growth in our business. With our top franchises delivering strong recurring revenue, our net bookings for Q3 grew 7.4% year-over-year for the quarter and for the full year we project 22% growth in net bookings over last year. Performance across the business and operational discipline also continued to deliver strong cash flow and underlying profitability growth in Q3. This continuing growth is anchored by proven franchises where we have a strong track record for execution. Apex Legends is now one of the biggest and most successful ongoing live services in the industry and is built on our owned IP. With more than 28 million new players joining in the last year and new seasons and in-game events that continue to deliver new experiences to a deeply engaged community, FY 2022 is the biggest year yet for Apex. Average player investment in the game has grown significantly year-over-year and we expect to achieve -- and we continue to expect net bookings for Apex to approach $1 billion in FY 2022. We are expanding to reach more players and viewers, with new original content on the way, our growing Apex Legends esports ecosystem, and Apex Legends Mobile which will soon be moving into soft launch as we continue our worldwide rollout. We've had strong engagement and community feedback during closed beta testing and we're excited for more players to experience Apex Legends Mobile soon. Mobile is a core growth engine for us, and it is accelerating. With new launches and acquired expertise and technologies leveraged across our portfolio, we expect mobile to be a major catalyst in FY 2023 with growth well into double digits. Led by Apex Mobile, our newly-updated FIFA Mobile game, Golf Clash and more unannounced projects, we are expanding our portfolio of more than 15 top mobile live services to reach new audiences and grow our recurring revenue. EA SPORTS is a powerhouse in the sports and entertainment world. We've driven hundreds of millions of dollars in net bookings growth year-to-date, with our EA SPORTS business up nearly 10% year-over-year. We continue to see incredible growth for the future of global soccer and our global soccer franchise was the number one title in the western world in calendar 2021. Madden NFL 22 was the number one sports title in the U.S. during the holiday period and it was the number three top selling game in the U.S. for all of last year. Under our leadership, F1 2021 also continues to perform well above expectations with unit sales nearly doubling year-over-year during the holiday period. In our mobile sports portfolio, we just launched the latest version of our EA SPORTS FIFA Mobile game around the world. This was the biggest update to the game ever and early performance has been exceptional. Engagement is up more than 50% over the previous season and retention in the first week is nearly double. With the added expertise of Playdemic and Glu, and a deep pipeline of new sports experiences in development, EA SPORTS continues to be an exceptional growth business, built on predictable and recurring revenue with outstanding opportunities ahead. Our pipeline further amplifies our strength. In addition to our core franchises, we are building new experiences in some of the biggest enduring IP in entertainment. Last week we announced a new agreement with Disney & Lucasfilm Games to develop new experiences in the Star Wars universe, continuing our collaboration of more than a decade. Respawn is leading development of the next game in our action-adventure Star Wars Jedi series, as well as two additional Star Wars titles. This adds to our deep pipeline of announced and unannounced projects with our wholly-owned IP, including Need for Speed, our BioWare franchises, The Sims, Skate, Dead Space and more. Looking forward, we are continuing to build on the structural advantages of our portfolio and accelerating growth by executing against our core strategy. We are focused on creating amazing games and content, providing creation tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences, aggregating and distributing our content and experiences to more players on more platforms, more geographies and business models, and harnessing the power of social ecosystems in and around our games. The demand for amazing games and new ways to play, watch, share and create has never been stronger. As one of the industry's largest and most profitable businesses with strong recurring revenue, we are well-positioned to take advantage of this continued secular growth. We look forward to delivering against these opportunities through FY 2023 and beyond. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake. Thanks, Blake. These are exciting times in our industry. Interactive entertainment continues to grow by every measure and our audiences are expanding and diversifying, major franchises are at the center of culture and entertainment, and the world is recognizing how games have the power to connect global communities. Our focus continues to be on our people, our players, on our amazing portfolio of games, content and services, and extraordinary growth opportunities in the future. Thanks to our incredibly talented teams at Electronic Arts, we are delivering entertainment to hundreds of millions of people around the world and connecting them through some of the most powerful and enduring franchises. With the breadth and depth of our business that continues to expand our network, deepen engagement, and drive growth in our recurring net bookings and ongoing profitability, we are well-positioned and strategically -- well-positioned strategically to continue building on our success and delivering for our players. As we look ahead and Blake just referenced, we were excited to announce yesterday that Chris Suh is joining Electronic Arts as our next CFO. Chris is coming to us after more than 25 years at Microsoft, where he served as Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Cloud and AI group, which he led with incredible success during Microsoft's transformation to a cloud-first company. We have a big vision for the future, and in addition to Chris' financial leadership of our organization, I look forward to having him as a strategic partner with extensive experience driving scale and growth to help us achieve our goals. As we announced previously, Blake will be leaving our team after nearly a decade of leadership at EA. Blake has been an incredible leader, partner and advisor. But most importantly, he is a dear friend and I feel deeply grateful for our time working together. His expertise and the team he has built have been instrumental in our growth and financial achievements, and have positioned us well for continued success. Blake will remain with us until the summer to assist with the transition and special projects. Thank you, Blake, for everything you've done and continue to do for our company, and again, thank you for your friendship. Now, we are here for your questions. Yeah. Great question. Again, we have a very bold vision for where this franchise go. This franchise has always led the category in creativity, innovation, scale, gameplay, community. And as we are coming to launch, again, we had a very bold vision for this game. As it turns out, we've had some challenges, not least of all, trying to build this game and provide this game from home, and so our focus now is really making sure that core experience lives up to our fans, the community's expectations. Beyond that we'll continue to invest and grow the franchise, we have great leadership with Vince and Byron, and others, with tremendous background from other great shooters in the industry, kind of leading the future. I believe that we're going to see this game do really well over the course of time. I think we'll expand to mobile. We will expand to other new interesting ways to play. But certainly this is just a moment where we take a pause and do all we can for the core game and the core community. Yeah. The very strength of our business is our balanced portfolio. We have both a deep and a broad portfolio. And what we've demonstrated over the course of our, the best part of 40 years is to really develop both our own IP over time, the Need for Speed, The Sims, Battlefield, Apex Legends, our BioWare franchises, we have Skate in development now, Dead Space on the way, so an incredible portfolio of own IP that has an extraordinary following across the industry. Combined with other long-term enduring IP, we have the powerhouse sports franchises. And they are true evergreen franchises and this is not just about licensing content. This is about working with over 300 partners across the various sports industries to deliver a true connection with the sports, the leagues, the teams, the players that our fans love. And we've been doing that now for well over 30 years and I think that we will continue to do that for many, many years in the future. And things like the Star Wars franchise, again, a long-term relationship we've had with Disney for more than a decade. And this is not simply about building or revisiting things that already exist in the universe, but really adding to that Star Wars universe and really delivering new opportunities for Star Wars fans to experience great Star Wars content. And so as you think about our strategy going forward and the strength of our company, it really comes down to our ability to develop and build and publish industry-leading owned IP, but also work with partners over decades to truly deliver fan favorites with long and enduring fan bases, like, our Sports franchises and like Disney. Yeah. Great question. And you should imagine we read this for some time as it turns out and part of the reason why we have built the strength in our broad and deep portfolio and why we have gone out in search of the best teams in the industry to bring them into our company and build great entertainment for our global player base, what is now well over 0.5 billion fans, is because we do believe in the power of entertainment. We just believe in the power of interactive entertainment. I think what we're seeing now in the marketplace is the launching of the value of what we do in particular. And so, as I think about the attainment coming together, you're seeing some other companies talk about this. But when we think about our players and we think about the things that they engage in, they play our games more than any other form of entertainment, but they also consume linear media and scripted entertainment and sports broadcasts, and music and other things. And so, as we look at the future, we are building strength in our whole ability to live interactive entertainment to our fans, which we think will continue to grow well north of a 1 billion fans over time. But we're also aware that our fans are expecting us to find new and interesting ways for them to experience entertainment. And so, as our -- as we think about the future, you should think about it with IP at the center and engagement around play, watch, creep, social ecosystem that brings that they love. And when you look at our strategy of what we're doing around in great -- creating great entertainment, around building tools, so that now community can engage more deeply, around the aggregation and distribution of content across platforms, across business models, across geographies, and really leaning into the social ecosystem to the board out of engagement in our games, I think you should imagine that's what the world look [Technical Difficulty] Yeah. So, I think that, you remember coming into the launch, the demand measures were very high, influence for us. The core underlying created for the game still has really strong demand around it. And we -- as I mentioned, we had some challenges around stability, particularly on high end PC machines and performance and there were some design decisions, but not all the community really agreed with. And so our focus right now is to really go back in and make sure we get that stuff right. And as much as I hate to admit it, DICE's the studio that has been able to do this a number of times now and really go back and rebuild at the core and reengage the community, as long as we do that in conjunction with a committee. That's what that studio was so great at doing. So I think the combination of DICE with the new leadership and a strong vision for the future, we will build out the core, we will reengage the community and we will manifest that demand that we saw coming into launch over the course of time. Mobile is still developing, the metrics are showing up really strong. I think, right now we're looking at going into the next closed beta at the end of this month, and as is the case of mobile, we need to choose and test in the environment. And then as it relates to free-to-play and other modes of play, again we have a big bold vision for this franchise. This franchise since its inception has been a leader in creativity and innovation was how it's played and how it's delivered. And you should expect that we will continue to work to deliver new and interesting ways to engage with this game over the course of time. And while I'm disappointed with how it launched, I'm still very excited for the future. Yeah. Great question. I will tell you, I started this industry over 20 years ago. At that point in time it was the fastest growing entertainment industry on the planet by a wide margin. I think it has been the fastest growing entertainment industry on the planet every year since then. But still people seem to be surprised by this. So we're not surprised by it at all, and I think, as technology has continued to evolve, we have been able to deliver new and interesting and fun ways to engage with content. And what we've seen more recently is just how powerful the social ecosystem, the social networks bought out of engagement in our games truly are amazing. Now -- it's not now just about ingesting entertainment the same way we do traditional scripted media or traditional broadcasters, usual music. This is about experiencing entertainment with your friends and that's unbelievably powerful. I think that has been really the fuel that has driven the growth in recent time. As part of that, of course, the ability to create your own content and put it into that ecosystem has become a really valuable part of, of what our industry offers to our players and our fans. The traditional media just doesn't and this is something that we hold true. Again, it's been at the very center of The Sims for a long time. It's at the very center of mode like FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team, to the very center of the design of Skate, which we'll be launching soon. And so this concept of UGC or user-generated content is really just an extension of the social interaction that I'm able to have with my friends in and around experiencing what is the best anytime on the planet. And so I believe that's going to be a really important part of our future. Now, to the extent whether we want to build that out or buy out over time, right now we are building, we're building technology, we're building credit, we're building assets with we're offering that out to communities around the world and we're seeing great uptake of that. If there was an acquisition opportunity in the future, we would openly look at that, but we don't -- we're not looking at anything at this juncture. Around the NFT and where VCs are investing, again we see this also happened our industry. We start with 3D, we start with AR/VR, we're now seeing with MCs. There's always something in and around our industry that is driving a lot of external investment. The way I look at this is, collectability is really built on four key metrics. It's around high quality content, it's around scarcity, it's around proof-of-authenticity and it's around a group of people that find value in that content. And we've seen that happen in the real world and we've seen that happen in a virtual world. We've certainly seen that happen in and around our games for some number of years. And I believe that collectability will continue to be an important part of our industry and the games and experiences that we offer our players. Whether that's part of the NFT and the blockchain? Well, that remains to be seen. And I think the way we think about it, is we want to deliver the best possible player experience we can. And so we're going to -- we will evaluate that over time. But right now, it's not something that we're driving audience. Yeah. Again, we are working closely with Glu. It is still relatively early days with the acquisition for both them and Playdemic, and we are working both on bolstering our existing 15 live services and building out new ones. And as per my prepared remarks, we're projecting well into double-digit growth next year and that includes Apex Mobile and renewed FIFA Mobile, and a full year of Golf Clash and ongoing growth across the portfolio and we're excited about that. With respect to advertising, specifically, we are taking the Glu advertising stack and applying it across our games. And it's little early to know just yet exactly how that will manifest, but based on what we are seeing across the industry, we expect that that represents some revenue growth there also. So, overall, mobile now really is a strength of ours. It's a very important part of how we drive growth in the business, both in our existing games, in our new launches and with the potential of mobile advertising across the portfolio. On engagement through or post-COVID, depending on how you think about it, I think we've been on a rolling situation around the world of kind of coming back and shaved down a little and coming back. Broadly speaking, though, much of the world is out and about, they're at sporting events, they go into theme parks, they're watching movies, they're going to dinner. So much of the world has returned mostly to normal at this juncture by our calculation. Even as part of that we've seen not only number of players grow, again, over 540 million people now on our network, we've also seen time spent in our games grow by over 20%. And I kind of look to that as not just about creating amazing games, entertainment, but it is the social interaction. I think what COVID has taught us is that games are a great way not just to get our entertainment fixed, to remain deeply connected with our friends and fans and rivals. And what we're seeing now, I believe, is actually the long-term effect of the discovery of not just the value of our of what we do in terms of entertainment, but also the value in maintaining connections with those we care most about and we would expect that to continue and actually create a flywheel for added growth. Yeah. I mean a great question and certainly another one of these things that is kind of a topic gives you at the moment and many people are talking about it in different contexts, quite frankly. At the end of the day, the metaverse is a three dimensional social space where you come together to experience things with your friends. And so now much of that happens in the two dimensional internet around the social networks that we see. But I will tell you, a lot of that happens in the context of our games. And as I look at the nature of our games, I look at the engagement that we're seeing inside these 3D spaces that we create in and around sports and other worlds. What you see with our industry is the beginnings of what a metaverse might be. And over the course of time, you should expect us to continue to expand and extend the world that we have been creating for the last 30 years and deliver more experiences beyond the core consider the game. So what can you do in FIFA beyond playing football? What were you doing Need for Speed beyond driving the game? What will you do in The Sims as you come together with your friends beyond the creation of content? And you'll see that continue to evolve for us over the course of time. And I don't know ultimately what the metaverse will become. But what I do know is the games we create are becoming more important as social spaces and they are just as places to enjoy great entertainment as we continue to build out those experiences and as whatever the metaverse becomes it's an almost certainty that we will play a very important role in it and that our players will be on the leading edge of the evolution of what these spaces might become. Yeah. Let me quickly hit on the EA Play component and then I'll let Blake talk about the mid-to-high single-digit growth. EA Pay continues to grow for us. It continues to be a really, really positive consumer experience, getting access to some of the greatest content in the industry. What we see more broadly across entertainment is its subscription continues to be a core driver. And what we're able to do is drive ongoing engagement, perhaps, in a way, even it -- the stronger than traditional linear or scripted entertainment. I think that you'll -- we will continue to see consumers engage in our content through subscription and we will continue to provide our content that way and I think we'll start to see more and more growth across platform. We continue to be the leading provider of a gaming subscription across platforms in our industry, and with the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the new experiences we have coming. We believe that we're going to continue to drive growth. And over the course of time back to my earlier point around entertainment, you might expect us to do more things beyond just games in the context of that subscription around a broader service for our clients and we're pretty excited about what that might become over the course of time. Yeah. So let me start with Madden. Madden is also having a great year and we're seeing tremendous growth. As you know and then for all of you who follow the season, this has been an unbelievably exciting season of football and what we know... ...and let's -- well, and what's exciting for a second, the playoff games and the season overall has been an unbelievably exciting game. The ratings for the NFL have been extremely strong through the year and that's driving really strong engagement in and around our Madden franchise and it continues to go from strength-to-strength. Yeah. And one thing, I just remind everybody, and we may have already said this, but I'll say it again. We shipped last year order due to the pandemic. We delayed it three weeks to move it into the third [Tech Difficulty] this year and the second quarter. So when you look at the growth of the third quarter, knowing that that didn't include the initial shift in a FIFA, it's almost hard to believe the strength of the business. And so I just want our people not to forget that and we're not going to provide numbers or details around that exactly, but just know that the situation we are having moved [Technical Difficulty] back to the second quarter. It's pretty impressive. Well, some detailed questions and the great question. So thank you. On Apex, again, as we -- as the teams put together these seasons of content and they think about that new content, a new modality to play, a new ways to connect. Remember, Apex is now well over 100 million clients. So there's no one size fits all component that really attracts new players or engages any broad group of players deeply. I think what the esports team and the Apex team in particular have been able to demonstrate is they work very close with their community. They deeply engage with their community and they are delivering content modalities, applying maps, these things that really speak to what the community are asking for and what we've seen since the very beginning of the launch of this game is them being able to work in a very calculated way around the delivery of really interesting new content, new maps and new models apply on a season by season basis that has continued to grow the overall player base, continue to grow the overall experience, continue to grow the engagement that play base has with the experience and the investment those players are making as part of their engagement. And so we're very excited about that. No. I think what -- based on exactly what you just said and what we've experienced, there is -- video game IP or interactive entertainment IP is now some of the most culturally relevant IP in all of entertainment and I think that's going to continue to grow. When you think about hundreds of millions of fans engaging in and around the IP we create, like, Apex, like, The Sims, like Need for Speed, like, our BioWare franchises, like, Dead Space, like, Skate. It's not a natural to that to spawn kind of a scripted entertainment element. I think traditionally, the scripted entertainment elements in our industry have not been big revenue drivers themselves. But where there have been a high quality, they've lifted the overall engagement the franchise more deeply, so there's kind of a one, two punch that drives growth in the business. I think as we think about our future, we do believe that this thing that we do that is interactive entertainment is becoming more and more important on a daily basis to all things, and that our fans are going to want to experience that in many different modalities and some of that might be scripted entertainment in nature. And you should expect that the way we're looking at any and all aspects that allow us to expand and expand our brands for our fan base. But we're doing it very thoughtfully, and again, as part of our strategy doing it profitably."

I also want to extend a warm welcome to everyone at Playdemic who are now officially part about Electronic Ops team. We're thrilled to have them on board adding to our continued strength in sports and mobile. Q2 FY '22 was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts. We're growing with our leading franchises, new launches, and large services all performing well during the quarter and our acquisition are driving additional growth beyond our core business. With more than 500 million unique active accounts, we're connecting players all over the world to each other, to a more about favorite content.  As a result, net revenue, net bookings, and EPS were above our Q2 guidance. And we're now raising our full-year net revenue, net bookings, and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year. Our core strategy is built on full key opportunities. The creation of amazing games and content. Tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences. The aggregation and distribution of content and experiences to an aggregated audience across platforms, business models, and geographies. And harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around down gains.  As part of this, we are executing against 3 growth drivers in FY '22, expanding our blockbuster franchises, building on our leadership in sports, and growing live services across our portfolio. I'll focus my comments on these today. With our talented creative teams, powerful IP and platform rates, we continue to grow leading blockbuster franchises. Experiences like EA sports FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and The Sims, are some of the most prominent and powerful properties in all of entertainment. Apex Legends continues to grow as one of the top franchises in the industry. A brand-new IP that has scaled to more than a 100 million players and is closing in on a billion dollars in net bookings annually. Season 9 and season 10 introspectively set new marks for the highest active players of Season one.  And Q2 was the biggest quarter of income spending in Apex that we've had to date. Apex is growing beyond the game as well. It was one of the most watched titles on Twitch during the quarter with more than a $130 million hours of season 10 content watched to-date, up nearly 40% from the previous season. As the success of Apex Legends continues, it demonstrates how we are building long-term ecosystems in and around our biggest franchises. At its core is outstanding gameplay. Embedded in an immersive world of law and characters that continues to expand. Seasons of new content and in-game events like the recent collection event, keep the experience fresh for new and returning players. We've introduced new experiences like the squad-based arenas and recently added a ranked mode.  The Apex Legends eSports ecosystem is growing as well. With the second year of Apex Legends Global Series now on the way. Apex is moving from strength to strength. And we will add to that when we bring Apex Legends to mobile platforms later this year. Battlefield, another of our blockbuster properties in beloved by tens of millions of fans. Ahead of our upcoming Battlefield 2043 launch this month, 7.7 million players participated in the Battlefield 2042 open battle in October, including 3.1 million during the early access period, which is the largest early access event we've ever had.  This is an opportunity to take an early version of the game still in development, bring in a large audience into the experience and test and learn ahead of launch. With a small squad for the game in our open beta, we brought players into the full scale, 128 player combats, and many of the only in Battlefield moments that make this franchise so special. The engagement and feedback from players also helped out teams with areas of the game play to polish and refine as we move towards launch. We've now revealed all three of the game\u2019s pillars. [Indiscernible] 128 plan multi-play Income Quest and breakthrough modes. Battlefield portal, a new write-up play that has the community very excited to create their own Battlefield experiences and hazard zones with completely new squad focus combat and tactical gameplay that fans are going to love.  We're looking forward to play as getting to all of these experiences when the full battle for 233 game launches on November 19. Europe 0.22, we're continuing to grow our leadership in sports through new gains, acquisitions, and new areas of expansion. Our global football, or soccer for us in the North America franchise continues to be one of the leading game properties in the world, with approximately a 100 million players across all platforms in the first 6 months of the fiscal year. EA Sports FIFA 22, which launched at the very end of Q2, is off to the strongest start in franchise history. The innovation and our new Hot promotion technology revolutionized gameplay and has inspired, engaged in growing the community. Total players were up 16%, and [Indiscernible] franchise players are up nearly 50% year-over-year from launch. With net bookings also up significantly year-over-year from launch. We're seeing growth across the game with Ultimate Team engagement up 15% year-over-year, and more players coming into Volta and career modes.  There is strength in all areas of our global football franchise, including Mobile, will later this fiscal year, will bring new modes, new features, and improved gameplay that FIFA Mobile, creating our most rewarding mobile football experience today. For nearly 30-years, EA SPORTS has been driven to create the best global football franchise in the world. Moving forward, we're in a position to drive greater growth in line with the continued expansion and popularity of the sport.  With the talent of our development teams, our robust portfolio of more than 300 license part including the Premier League, UEFA, CONMEBOL, the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A, the MLS, [Indiscernible], and many more. And our expertise in growth areas including e-sports and mobile. EA sports are ready to activate across the full spectrum of the football world. We have opportunities of new modalities of play, and new social experiences that will bring more fans together. As the sport grows, we have opportunities to expand cultural and lifestyle experiences through brand partnerships and content that our fans want more of in and around the game.  And we will continue to lead with the most innovative games on more platforms bringing the full breadth of the sport to the forefront from grassroots football to more of women's league teams and clients. We are more confident than ever about our broad future football and we will grow our franchises leadership with our partners around the world. We are continually investing in innovation, creativity, and all benches to bring EA SPORTS games close to the heart of real-world sporting fans. Engagement in Madden NFL '22 has grown each week of this NFL season as players jump into the refreshed Franchise Mode and Madden Ultimate Team to connect and compete with their friends.  We've grown the implementing business year-over-year as F1 2021 when Codemasters continues to bring in more players and keep fans engaged in one of the most intense F1 [Indiscernible] in years. NHL 22 launched in October, just as the NHL season began. With a new next-generation console experience delivering a dramatic new visual and gameplay leap for hockey fans. With a portfolio that now spend global football, American football, basketball, hockey, baseball, golf, UFC Fighting, and racing. No other entertainment provider in the world has the reach across top-level leagues, teams, and partners as EA SPORTS. We have a unique opportunity to bring together these properties and passionate [Indiscernible] enabling social connections through more innovative experiences and content.  Expanding a live service across our portfolio, particularly in mobile, is our third growth driver for FY 2022. In Q2, we closed the acquisition of Playdemic, creators of the massively successful Gulf clash mobile games. We're looking forward to combining our strength to continue the success of Gulf clash as a live service and bringing the clash mechanic to more of our sports franchises where our [Indiscernible] expertise will enable us to create some great new experiences. Our EA Mobile teams also continue to derive success in launch services, including Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which surpassed 100 million players last-to-date in Q2. Through the collective talent of the Glu Mobile, Playdemic, and EA Mobile teams.  We have built a powerful mobile [Indiscernible] of organization within a year. This group is shortly for accelerating growth in our portfolio. More than 15 top mobile live services, as well as introducing new experiences that takeout powerful IP, including Battlefield in the expanding mobile audience. The opportunities in front of us are exciting. We feel great about the position we are in with strong leaders, including our new Chief Operating Officer, managing Company-wide operations, creative leaders joining our management team, and our new Chief Executive Officer leading our efforts to grow social ecosystems. All supporting our 19 games as we drive growth in the next year of interactive entertainment. Now, I will turn the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of play day at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable Mobile title and Butte trend for new sports titles in our broad portfolio. We delivered net revenue of $1.83 billion and net bookings of $1.85 billion. Net bookings were $126 million above our guidance, making it our largest Q2 ever. And more than doubled the level of last year's. We're raising our guidance again for the second time this year based on our confidence of our franchises and live services through the remainder of the year.  EA SPORTS FIFA 21 performed exceptionally well through its product cycle, with engagement in its last couple of months [Indiscernible] very significantly on FIFA 20. Keeping fans engaged, drove strong retention from FIFA 21 into FIFA 22. We're off to the strongest start ever with the new title. Full game sales, and FIFA Ultimate Team are both up double-digits year-on-year based on the first three weeks of sales. Apex Legends net bookings were up over 150% year-on-year. There was some benefit from having 2 collections of that this quarter, but even so the underlying growth rate is clearly extremely strong. Apex has delivered over $1.6 billion in net bookings life to-date, and we're well ahead of our expectations for the year.  To launch an original IP and steadily building into a franchise of this magnitude is exceptional. And I would like to recognize the respond team for their creativity, deep understanding of the player base, and for their excellent execution, which can be seen again this week with the successful launch of seasonal level. Although we continue to watch closely, we have not seen a slowdown in engagement or stand on our games as countries such as the UK emerged from lockdown. Digital represents 62% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6% points from last year.  The strong digital mix for full game sales aided by growth in live services, pushed underlying gross margins significantly above last year's. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in slightly below our expectations. So now turning to guidance, we now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.848 billion, and earnings per share of $2.03 up from our original expectations of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are raising our net bookings guidance for the year by $225 million to $7.625 billion.  This is driven by outperformance so far this year plus ongoing strength from Apex and FIFA and just under $100 million from 6 months of Playdemic. This is partially offset by pressure on some of our Mobile titles, including product changes and IDFA impacts and some moves elsewhere in our portfolio. Our expectations for Battlefield are roughly unchanged from the time of our last call. We started the year already forecasting strong organic growth, and now we're $325 million ahead of that, having raised guidance twice. More specifics are in the downloadable model we post on our website.  We have also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.95 billion, with capital expenditures reduced to around $200 million this year, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.75 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. As noted last quarter, capex is at an elevated level for a couple of years as we invest in our employee work environments and new offices around the globe. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion, cost of revenue, would be $625 million, and operating expenses of $1.1 billion.  This results in an earnings per share of $0.02 for the third quarter. Remember GAAP EPS is driven by GAAP revenue deferrals, which is a very large number in Q3. We expect Q3 Financial 2022, net bookings to be $2.625 billion, up over 9% on last year's Q3, which it should be noted, included last year, the launch of FIFA21, that was the large quarter ever for Q3 of the Company's history. The games and live service teams are driving continued growth in our franchises. And we have Battlefield launching in just over a week. Our broad portfolio of games and live services position us well for a strong holiday season, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year, and beyond. Now, I'll hand the call back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Blake. The holiday quarter is always an exciting time. We're looking forward to delivering amazing entertainment and connecting hundreds of millions of players around the world through each other throughout games and live services in the months ahead. I'm going to take the opportunity here to say thank you again to our incredible teams at electronic apps. Their commitment to creativity and innovation in service applies is second to none. And every day it is inspiring to work alongside such talented and dedicated people. It's been a strong year to date, and we're confident in our plans to drive continued growth in the years ahead. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: If you would like to ask a question at this time, please [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just have two. First, I was just wondering if you could provide us an update on your outlook for some of your new Mobile titles like Apex Legends and Battlefield, and then second, I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on the FIFA license, how aggressively will you negotiate for that, and what are some of the contingencies that you have planned for that one. Thank you.\nBlake Jorgensen: Let me start with Mobile and then I'll let Andrew answer the FIFA question. We have not put in to our guidance virtually any revenue for either Apex Mobile or Battlefield Mobile this year. Apex Mobile is currently in test in multiple countries around the world. And we never quite know exactly what we're going to get out of test markets, but we're very pleased with the progress so far, which means we could bring it out earlier, but I would say that most of it is really focused on next year, which we think is a positive since this year is so strong. It will continue to help next year. And I would put Battlefield in that same category.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. And I would just cover up. The metrics that we're getting out of those games continues to be very strong. And so, we continue to be confident about the opportunity around both of them. And with respect to license negotiations, I would start by saying, we have great relations with all of our partners, all 300 of them, including FIFA. As we think about the future of football, we think the future is very bright. We are positive and very fabric of the cultural football globally and important part of fandom for football, and when we got to interact with hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe. They want more modalities of play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11 on 11 football. They want more digital experiences outside the game, eSports, NFTs, broader sports consumption. And they want us to move really, really quickly. And so, I would tell you as we think about the future of football within is very bright, we're going to work with our global collection of partners that will still best enable us to do that. And we'll continue our conversations with each and every one of them to the extent that they are aligned with that objective.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Blake.\nOperator: Next question is from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Thanks [Indiscernible] I just have 2 questions for you. The first one is, how should we think about Apex Legends, live services, and maybe even a comment or 2 on Battlefield live services as we head through the holiday and into next year. Or is it just a matter of more content, better efficiency on monetization, or how should we think about live services there?\nAndrew Wilson: What I talked about in the prepared remarks is that the Apex Legends team has really been very thoughtful and deliberate about the development and the building of this live service and the community support since the very beginning. And it starts with core gameplay. And what we've seen them be out to do with bringing more players each and every season. And kind of our weekly active in our monthly active players is grown throughout the cycle so far. They add new models of play, to things like ranked mode and arenas.  They add new events that are important and more deeply engage the community. And so, I think that as we think about live service on a go forward basis, you should expect that thing to continue to be thoughtful and deliberate. They'll continue to build out modalities of play, they'll continue to create more content, but also really work with the community-on-community level in events which really drive the most engagement over time. And we continue to be very confident this is going to be a really, really strong global franchise for us for at least a decade.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then just a second question, Andrew, just high level, you're pretty forward-thinking CEO when it comes to technology. How do you see things like play-to - earn opportunities within the video games space? There seems to be a bit of an argument on whether that's good or bad for gaming.\nAndrew Wilson: Anything that brings more people in and engages those people for more time in a context with the extent that I think it's a good thing over time. I think that is the very foundation of our live services. I think the play-to-earn or the NFC conversation is still really, really early. And there's a lot of conversation and is at some level a lot of hype about it. I do think it will be an important part about the future of our industry on a go-forward basis. But it's still early to figure out how that's going to work. I feel good about our position with respect to that.  I mean, as a Company, we have been leaders in the creation of digital content that has real collectible value in the embedding of that content as part of large services and what we know about collection over time is that collectability is far more valuable to the collector, where the collected item has utility. And I think that in the context of the games that we create and the live services that we offer, Collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future. So still early to tell, but I think we're in a really good position and you should expect us to think more innovatively and creatively about that on a go-forward basis.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Awesome. Thank you so much guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen.\nDoug Creutz: Hey, thanks. In your commentary, you alluded to some softness in the mobile market. I [Indiscernible] if could you just talk a little bit more about what you've seen, some of what your peers have important numbers that would suggest there was some sequential softening in the market. Do you think it's done the IDFA? Do you think there's different dynamics and playing with pandemic restrictions, easing in mobile versus console? Any color you can give would be helpful.\nAndrew Wilson: I think when we -- sorry.\nBlake Jorgensen: Sorry go ahead. Andrew. Go ahead. No, you can go ahead.\nAndrew Wilson: I was going to say I think that when we look at across our mobile portfolio, we feel like we're in a really good position on a go-forward basis. We've got strong teams, got a strong IP, we've got a huge network of players, and we've got global reach. And we're already seeing the value of that when you think about our ability to offer EA IP for Glu Mobile folks, or our Playdemic folks to start thinking about new and interesting experiences.  I didn't think we've seen some softness in some of our games, particularly those that rely a little bit more needs acquisition. I think that will work through that over time. Again, creative talent, great IP, huge network applies in global reach allowance work through that and find a path through that. But net-net, I think that there is a little idea phase. But nothing that has us concerned about our ability to continue to grow our Mobile business overtime.\nBlake Jorgensen: And [Indiscernible], I would say don't underestimate that in any -- I mean, we did 4 acquisitions in one year. There are always challenges to integration of acquisitions and sometimes those challenges are done we changed plans inside the businesses. There are things that we may not have anticipated or fully understood. And so, some of that is impacting -- none of it is troublesome, none of it is long term in our mind, and we're doing a great job in the integration it just happened also quickly. You can't plan on exactly when acquisitions are going to happen.  And we're very excited about the Glu team and the Playdemic team as Andrew mentioned in his comments. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position and I think for us the biggest opportunity is, and this is an obvious one and that is, how do we take our existing sports licensors and the talent that the Glu's and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through that talent base and -- or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. And it's a huge opportunity for us, obviously in FIFA, but also in Madden and PGA and other areas where we can either augment their games, add to their games, or add new games. And so that's why we're so excited about the acquisitions and not all that worried about any short-term softness in the business.\nDoug Creutz: Very helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nMr. David: Thank you. This is David on for Alexia. Just with Battlefield. Maybe you could discuss the key learnings from the data. How much should we read into participation for the early access period of indicator of demand. And I wonder if you just had a comment on the risk of if any, of releasing the game a week part of Black Friday? I think this was somewhat of a challenge for the game in 2018.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. So, I think that on balance, the feedback from the beta was overwhelmingly positive. There were some conversations around some elements of the beta, which is not unnatural innovator. And we will be able to take that feedback around those elements -- those constructive elements and really implement that in the game. And again, I think what we had talked about with the community is, it was an earlier build of the game that we used for the beta as the team continues to work, and tune, and polish the final build for the game. So, we feel really good about that. I think when you think about the early access numbers and engaging numbers overall, you should read that as tremendous demand.  The game is very appealing, the setting is very appealing, the modalities of play, the innovation and creativity that does, and the other things to work on that game -- have put into the game is something that the community's receiving very, very well and is really, really excited about. I wouldn't read too much into the week before Black Friday, I get that on a calendar basis, that looks the same as Battlefield 5. I would tell you though needing the Battlefield 5, we did not see the level of demand we're seeing now.  We did not have the level of innovation and again that we have now. We didn't have new platform technology driving a high-fidelity gaming experience that we have now. And so net-net coming out of the beta, we feel very good about player demand, the team has been working very hard on tuning and polish and filing the game where we feel really good about the game that the committee is going to get to play on day one. And the team also has wonderful plans for the future large service. That stuff where there's notion of [Indiscernible] nearly engaging our players deeply in the ability to create their own Battlefield experiences. And so, we feel very good and confident about the future Battlefield at this stage.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. The other thing I would -- I'd remember about Black Friday is that in years past there may have been 5 times more games in the marketplaces that will be this year. We already know that many games have been postponed, and so the calendar is nowhere near as crowded. Which means the need for discounting is nowhere near as high.  Second is, and more importantly is that, as we talked about, we're now running over 60 plus percent digital downloads and a game like Battlefield cues even more to PCs, which means the download numbers going to be even higher. And what that Allows us to do, is make short-term price changes if we need to, but we don't have to cut big deals with retailers like we used to do historically. And I think that will bode well for us from an ability to sell through a lot of games, as well as not have to discount those games dramatically.\nMr. David: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Thank you and good afternoon. A couple from me as well. Apex performance looks really strong. The season updates are driving a lot of usage and monetization growth, but I'm curious beyond those updates and the Mobile extensions. Is it fair to say that you don't really see a need still for a bigger refresh or sequel to either Apex or the Legacy franchise? And then secondly, I might have missed it, but I didn't see commentary on Fiscal '23 growth in the release, which I think you had included last quarter. Thanks\nAndrew Wilson: And I'll let Blake the second part.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yeah. That's what I'm about to say.\nAndrew Wilson: We continue to believe. Again, I go back to respond as a team, have been very deliberate and thoughtful about developing and building this franchise and nurturing and growing the community and their engagement over time. And I actually -- I think we're just at the beginning, I think there's such tremendous upside, and all that we're doing both in the existing experience on existing platforms and as we expand the Mobile. But again, I have nothing to announce today. But when you think about the broader ecosystem of experiences, we plan to offer, I wouldn't discount the notion of adding more modalities of play or even more tradition modalities of play to that experience, overtime.\nBlake Jorgensen: And I would just note following the number of characters that are now in the game versus on day 1 are dramatically different and just gives you a sense of how that game is continuing to evolve, not to mention the ways to play, the modalities, land, the maps and so forth. On the 23 questions, I think, you know this, because we've been talking about just business for a long time. We typically don't even start talking about 23 until our third quarter, and we don't really give guidance until the end of our fourth quarter. What I will tell you is we are very optimistic about '23 and that's possibly what we're trying to signal today in that optimism and excitement.  And I think the thing to remember is over 70% of our business is in a lot of services, and that comprises things like Ultimate Team, Apex, Mobile, The Sims. It is questioning the special sauce of what we do. It is bringing people together, make sure that they're part of a social network, and then continue to serve them content that keeps them engaged in what they love. And that is different than many other companies in the industry. We've always tried to help people understand about the breadth of our franchises. And when you think about live services in combination with our sports franchises, which have come out every year at the same time basically, for -- mainly the life of this Company.  And we 've built incredible live services around those sports franchises, which makes it a much safer business model than having to go build something from scratch and hope you get it out on time. And when you then broaden that across The Sims and Mobile titles. And then add live services to new titles like Battlefield that don't have real life services today, you have a much more stable and growing business for the future. So, we're very confident in growth for next year independent of any one title because of that live service component of our business. And we're very excited about what that means going forward, and the ability for us to continue to add and evolve those live services to be even bigger over time\nColin Sebastian: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Martin Yan with Oppenheimer.\nMartin Yan: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question, I have 2. Number 1 is on FIFA or sports games with collection elements. In general, how do you think about maybe maintaining the value of player investments and making their annually investments into the micro-transactions [Indiscernible] during over, perhaps on longer time? And I have a second question.\nAndrew Wilson: Do you want to give us a second question then we'll answer them?\nMartin Yan: Sure.\nAndrew Wilson: We'll, answer them both.\nMartin Yan: So, the second question is on your -- maybe our detailed rationale of elevating the studio GMs to executive leadership team. I think that's quite unique for a AAA publisher, and maybe help us understand what are the benefits and what exactly they will do to, in their decision--making and how they are getting involved with the executive leadership team.\nAndrew Wilson: Both really good questions. I think of that -- as we think about digital collectibles, particularly our sports games, again, in different across different franchise. And so, collectability has different value over time. And collectability games like FIFA, and Maden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time. And the short answer to that is yes. And the slightly longer answer to that is, we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players.  And we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy. And you're seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending that -- they're getting that value. But we will continue -- as we have evolved the Ultimate Team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players. To your second question around elevating studio GMs, for me it's a very pragmatic choice. When I think about the growth vectors for us as a Company inside of our industry, there is extraordinary games and content.  There were tools to more deeply engage the community, there will be aggregation and distribution of that content on aggregated audience. And there is an ecosystem born out of the engagement content, but exist beyond the [Indiscernible] gaming experience. At the end of the day, every one of those value drivers stops with the games and the content that we create. And so, for me it was really saying to our creative leaders. I want to make sure that you are in a strategic conversation, is going to help us drive growth as a Company. I think it is a very central strands of DNA of who we are.  They have demonstrated unbelievable leadership in our Company in support of our employees and in support of our fans and in the creation of amazing games and content. And this is a recognition that the next buys of growth of this Company are going to be born out of innovation and creativity across those 4 vectors but it will all start with that content. And as the leaders of the teams that create that content, I thought it was important to have them in the conversation.\nMartin Yan: Got it. Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Next questions from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson.\nClay Griffin: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to Battlefield. You've talked about there being a strong free-to-play component within Battlefield ultimately. So, I guess, putting aside the Mobile extension, do you have a better sense of what that might look like now or do you need to see the engagement with the various game modes, I guess post launch and [Indiscernible]?\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, when we think about all of our games and our big blockbuster franchises like Apex, like FIFA, like Madden, like Battlefield [Indiscernible] we're always thinking about innovation and creativity at its core, how do we build that out into modalities of play? How do we think about that across platform? How do we think about the extension those experiences and business model is 1 piece of that puzzle? I think when we look at our Battlefield franchise today with the knowledge that it probably makes sense to have a free-to-play component to that overall ecosystem in the future.  Job number 1 was truly a reinvention of the action shooter category and I think that's what they have seek -- sort of do. And that's what they've achieved through this 128-plan multiplayer [Indiscernible] expansion, deeper engagement in creativity to portal mode, and innovative new modes in and around the game. I think the next page of that is going to be the launch of the Battlefield Mobile total. And then as we continue to expand that -- and that in itself will serve tens of millions of players. I think as we ever think about further expanding apply those over time, free-to-play will make sense for the franchise, but it's not the focus right now.\nClay Griffin: Great. And then I guess, if you look at Battlefield historically, I guess my sense is that the community has as a general rule, not always maybe embrace cosmetic customization to the extent we've seen in other games. I guess, the question is, is that a fair assessment? And if so, I guess how do you think about monetization without reverting back to a DLC type monetization mechanic that might fracture the player base?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I'm not sure the notion of not being engaged in cosmetic content, is a fair assessment. I think that I don't feel premium, some number of years ago was kind of an innovation in the category that really extended the game experience out. 12, 18, 24 months. I think we saw deep engagements from the community in that. I think what we also sold out which we didn't get all of the community to engage deeply in that. And some parts the community want to engage in kind of a different profile. And so, we did away with premium, we've been kind of working with the community since then on different ways to extend and enhance the experience through live service. I feel good about what the team has planned now, I feel like it gives everybody in the community, which is probably bigger than 40 million players right now, an opportunity we extend and enhance their experience and engage.  Why that makes sense for them, but it doesn't bifurcate or trifurcate the community anyway. So, I think that this is a great community. I think they're a core community. I think the franchise and beloved amongst them. I think what we're seeing, even having been out of the market for 3 years, is demand and appeal continues to be incredibly high. And I'm excited about what we're going to launch with again, but I'm even more excited by the plans the team has taken and grow and expand that experience for global player.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Your next questions from Mario Lu, with Barclays.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks for taking a question. My question is on previous pack. In the pack, I believe roughly 1/3 of Ultimate Team players for payers. So, any color you can share on how the payer conversion has improved via this new mechanism and secondly, do you think this method of monetization is specific to player pack or can it be transferred to other titles like into Apex packs for example?\nAndrew Wilson: I don't have specific metrics on Pike conversion that I can share today. I'm going to say what we have seen in the combination of all of the new advancements we did in Ultimate Team, including one element which is the preview products. We've seen higher engagement and higher monetization overall. And as we've rolled that out, what we've seen is that we've converted a different level of spender or a different type of spender on the comics to preview packs. And so, what's clear to us is this is a really fun and new and innovative and creative way throughout our growing play [Indiscernible] engage with the most popular mode in the game. And we'll continue to evolve and offer new things. And as I said earlier, we're always trying to figure out a way to offer new place of value for our players, and new reasons for them to engage and connect with their friends through the experience. On the notion of could -- evolve into other areas. I think the shortage that is absolutely. I think what we're seeing is that the surprise and delight of the traditional surprise mechanic continues to be something that is really fun and rewarding for this pond apply base. And then there's another group applies -- want to think differently about how they extended enhance their experience.  And you should expect that we will take the learning from FIFA across the portfolio and learning from elsewhere in the portfolio, things like our Mobile business, and things like Apex Legends, bring that back into our sports franchises. So, part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle, and having 0.5, billion implied in our network engaging deeper in the experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio and we're going to look to continue to do great things for our players as we learn from franchise-to-franchise.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Your next question is from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.\nEric Handler: Thank you, very much and good evening, 2 questions for you. First on Apex Legends. I'm curious, a little over a year or so ago, we -- you started to talk a little bit more about localization for the game. Wonder if you could give us a little update there and how that's impacted the engagement, or bookings, or whatever. And then secondly, I think it's been a couple of quarters since we've heard much about The Sims Franchise. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about what's happening with that franchise. Is it still on a growth trajectory and where are you seeing innovation there?\nBlake Jorgensen: Hey, Andrew?\nAndrew Wilson: I thought you might grab that one, Blake, sorry,\nBlake Jorgensen: We know. you\nEric Handler: Guys\nBlake Jorgensen: Normally I just pointed him across the table, or he points at me. The Apex Legends, I'll start there, and to Andrew can talk a little bit about The Sims. We continue to work on how and why Apex works in certain markets. And there are certain markets, that it is unbelievable the strength of the franchise, where we haven't really done much of it than localized the language. Japan is a great example of that. And so, the team has been working hard, particularly on the Mobile build of the game to be able to localize it more to how people want to play the game in those markets. And then you want to be careful that you don't bifurcate the game in too many ways, but there may be some ways cosmetically or beyond language adjustments to make the game more powerful in those markets.  And you should have seen that soon, that's an ongoing process. It is hard to see and hard for us to carve that out as part of the financials. But trust that part of the reason that the business continues to grow as that we are doing that, you'll see much more of that as the mobile build, starts to go broad in the world where we're entering markets, where people have not played the game on console or PC because those aren't available to them.  And so, part of the markets that we're testing right now, are those types of markets where this is a new game for them, and so we're watching very closely as to how people play that, react to that, do they have positive or negative reactions to certain characters, for example, of certain types of gameplays. And that's part of why we want to take our time to make sure we test the Mobile build around the world because that's where it's the most powerful and where the most upside exist.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, and on The Sims again, The Sims is one of the great franchises about industry and exists in a category where we have very little competition as lost doll category. The Sims continued to do well with all engagement metrics up year-over-year. with Q2 bookings were up 32% year-over-year. In July, we released colleagues leading our 11th expansion pack, which quickly became one of the most popular packs we've ever done, Android performance. Well above our internal focus to the franchisees.  So, I guess I think this is a growing player base in the seams, the franchise's continued to grow. And I would tell you, again, we had a lot to talk about other than The Sims today. We'll come back and share more in the future, but that team continues to think about how to grow that franchise. Even more than this a -- in a category and with a player base that is very different from the rest of that portfolio.\nEric Handler: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question is from Steven Chu with Credit Suisse.\nSteven Chu: Okay. Thank you. So hey, Andrew and Blake. So, it's kind of building on the Apex Mobile commentary just now. Just wondering if you can give us an update on a more granular level on the cross pollination or polonization, I guess, between your newly acquired Mobile development studios with the EA brands. I think we're all very an ago to watch expand a FIFA audience to 2 billion plus. Given the footprint of football, football slash soccer. So just I understand to do no harm for the newly acquired studios where you have to be thinking about the multiple iterations, FIFA, or I guess UFC, as it might be known in the future. So just an update if you if you can, on what you might be doing in terms of the integration there.\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. Again, it's still relatively early for these integrations. And Playdemic is really, really early. But what I would tell you is, as we've thought about this, we really think about it across 3 vectors. Which is the core credit teams and how to best get value there and we have built a single Mobile organization out of our EA Mobile teams Playdemic and Glu on the Jeff Koppers, who is an industry veteran but has more than a decade in Mobile leadership. And is really rethinking and building a strong forward-looking strategy around Mobile for us. The second element is IP, and when we did these acquisitions, we talked about both sport and lifestyle. TAP Sports, baseball, Golf Clash, Design Home, Covet Fashion, FIFA, Madden, UFC, hockey, The Sims.  And so, part of what was going that before is we start to think about the integration. We have gone through; we're working on seems to -- we were working on this thing. It probably doesn't make that much sense to build that game when you can take that engine on apply it to the FIFA business, the TAP Sports engine, or the Gulf clash engine to football -- European football or American football. And we're in that planning phase right now and I would say the teams themselves, they're are really excited to take that core underlying technology and really apply to franchises that have global reach and global strength. The third is just kind of our network at play and how we start to work across that.  Glu has a tremendous advertising engine. And we're starting to think about how to tight that advertising engine across our client network into our other products. We're already starting to see the benefit. And then things like reach, we've already been able to launch TAP Sports, Baseball into Japan. And so, some early wins in what is still an early phase of integration. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as the leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of Mobile -first talent on global portfolio of IP, a network of half a billion players and global reach. And I think you should watch this space because there's lots of great things coming over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the place of Mobile.\nSteven Chu: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jamie Pass with Berenberg.\nJamie Bass: Thanks for the question. I was actually going to ask a couple of things that Marden, been covered now. So, 1 question remaining, which is stay with commentary from results when your peers about the potential for wage inflation among developers overcoming yet, could you just give a bit of color on how you're thinking on the cost side, are you worried about increasing headcount and the potential cost associated with that?\nAndrew Wilson: I'm sorry.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes.\nAndrew Wilson: Go ahead Go ahead. Sorry.\nBlake Jorgensen: I was just going to say we always spend time thinking about that and trying to manage it as best as possible. I think there's no doubt that there's going to be some wage inflation. The bulk of what you, if you're looking at our P&L, the bulk of what you see in terms of increases in Apex are due to the fact that we brought new people into the Company through acquisitions, as well as through new hires. I don't see a substantial wage inflation pressure, but we're always conscious of it and trying to manage that.\nJamie Bass: Okay. Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: And I will just say I think we are committed as an organization. We're very thoughtful with that compensation for all of our people to ensure that we keep pace with the market, and they are fairly rewarded for the amazing work they do. And so far, we have been able to do that really well. And I think we'll continue to do that in the future.\nJamie Bass: That's very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question is from Andrew Marok with Raymond James.\nAndrew Marok: Thanks for taking my question. One on the content cadence for Apex. So, response's been clear about their intention to limit crunch and is settled int the quarterly season releases. Is 1 season every 3 months a magic timeframe for players and for respond? Or is it the case were stepping up could potentially increase the velocity of season launches? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: It's an ongoing question. I think there is no straight answer to that. I think there's a lot -- we've got a lot of questions to the response engines are very inception of Apex Legends launch. As I continue to say, that team is being very deliberate and very thoughtful and works very closely with the community. They have in fact staffed up dramatically. They've got more people in LA, they've going another team in Vancouver that continues to work on the game and grow and develop more content.  I would say I think this team more than just about any other team in our Company and perhaps the industry, they have a very deep understanding of the player base and the community and they are building for the long-term. And so, the short answer is, could we deliver more content? Possibly. Does that make sense? Maybe. But what I do is I trust that team to be very close to [Indiscernible] thoughtful about how they build and develop that content over time, and that will mean sometimes that every 3 months, sometimes that it will be longer and some time it will be shorter.  But what we have seen them do and demonstrate now since the very inception is their ability to maintain player sentiment, to be a hard the best talent into their organization and continue to grow the business over time. And I think that they will continue to do that for many, many years in the future. So, with that, we'll wrap up the call there. Thank you, everyone for joining us and for great questions. Be well, and we'll speak with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Bye So,\nOperator: This concludes this conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We had a strong beat this quarter, primarily driven by our live services led by Apex Legends and FIFA Ultimate Team. We closed our acquisition of play day at the end of the quarter, adding both a highly profitable Mobile title and Butte trend for new sports titles in our broad portfolio. We delivered net revenue of $1.83 billion and net bookings of $1.85 billion. Net bookings were $126 million above our guidance, making it our largest Q2 ever. And more than doubled the level of last year's. We're raising our guidance again for the second time this year based on our confidence of our franchises and live services through the remainder of the year.  EA SPORTS FIFA 21 performed exceptionally well through its product cycle, with engagement in its last couple of months [Indiscernible] very significantly on FIFA 20. Keeping fans engaged, drove strong retention from FIFA 21 into FIFA 22. We're off to the strongest start ever with the new title. Full game sales, and FIFA Ultimate Team are both up double-digits year-on-year based on the first three weeks of sales. Apex Legends net bookings were up over 150% year-on-year. There was some benefit from having 2 collections of that this quarter, but even so the underlying growth rate is clearly extremely strong. Apex has delivered over $1.6 billion in net bookings life to-date, and we're well ahead of our expectations for the year.  To launch an original IP and steadily building into a franchise of this magnitude is exceptional. And I would like to recognize the respond team for their creativity, deep understanding of the player base, and for their excellent execution, which can be seen again this week with the successful launch of seasonal level. Although we continue to watch closely, we have not seen a slowdown in engagement or stand on our games as countries such as the UK emerged from lockdown. Digital represents 62% of full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6% points from last year.  The strong digital mix for full game sales aided by growth in live services, pushed underlying gross margins significantly above last year's. Operating expenses, which include recent acquisition costs, came in slightly below our expectations. So now turning to guidance, we now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.848 billion, and earnings per share of $2.03 up from our original expectations of $1.34. Remember that this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We are raising our net bookings guidance for the year by $225 million to $7.625 billion.  This is driven by outperformance so far this year plus ongoing strength from Apex and FIFA and just under $100 million from 6 months of Playdemic. This is partially offset by pressure on some of our Mobile titles, including product changes and IDFA impacts and some moves elsewhere in our portfolio. Our expectations for Battlefield are roughly unchanged from the time of our last call. We started the year already forecasting strong organic growth, and now we're $325 million ahead of that, having raised guidance twice. More specifics are in the downloadable model we post on our website.  We have also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.95 billion, with capital expenditures reduced to around $200 million this year, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.75 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. As noted last quarter, capex is at an elevated level for a couple of years as we invest in our employee work environments and new offices around the globe. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.75 billion, cost of revenue, would be $625 million, and operating expenses of $1.1 billion.  This results in an earnings per share of $0.02 for the third quarter. Remember GAAP EPS is driven by GAAP revenue deferrals, which is a very large number in Q3. We expect Q3 Financial 2022, net bookings to be $2.625 billion, up over 9% on last year's Q3, which it should be noted, included last year, the launch of FIFA21, that was the large quarter ever for Q3 of the Company's history. The games and live service teams are driving continued growth in our franchises. And we have Battlefield launching in just over a week. Our broad portfolio of games and live services position us well for a strong holiday season, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year, and beyond. Now, I'll hand the call back to Andrew. Let me start with Mobile and then I'll let Andrew answer the FIFA question. We have not put in to our guidance virtually any revenue for either Apex Mobile or Battlefield Mobile this year. Apex Mobile is currently in test in multiple countries around the world. And we never quite know exactly what we're going to get out of test markets, but we're very pleased with the progress so far, which means we could bring it out earlier, but I would say that most of it is really focused on next year, which we think is a positive since this year is so strong. It will continue to help next year. And I would put Battlefield in that same category. Sorry go ahead. Andrew. Go ahead. No, you can go ahead. And [Indiscernible], I would say don't underestimate that in any -- I mean, we did 4 acquisitions in one year. There are always challenges to integration of acquisitions and sometimes those challenges are done we changed plans inside the businesses. There are things that we may not have anticipated or fully understood. And so, some of that is impacting -- none of it is troublesome, none of it is long term in our mind, and we're doing a great job in the integration it just happened also quickly. You can't plan on exactly when acquisitions are going to happen.  And we're very excited about the Glu team and the Playdemic team as Andrew mentioned in his comments. And I think going forward, we're in a really good position and I think for us the biggest opportunity is, and this is an obvious one and that is, how do we take our existing sports licensors and the talent that the Glu's and the Playdemics have in the sports side and drive new sports products through that talent base and -- or have them help our talent drive better products across those licenses. And it's a huge opportunity for us, obviously in FIFA, but also in Madden and PGA and other areas where we can either augment their games, add to their games, or add new games. And so that's why we're so excited about the acquisitions and not all that worried about any short-term softness in the business. Yeah. The other thing I would -- I'd remember about Black Friday is that in years past there may have been 5 times more games in the marketplaces that will be this year. We already know that many games have been postponed, and so the calendar is nowhere near as crowded. Which means the need for discounting is nowhere near as high.  Second is, and more importantly is that, as we talked about, we're now running over 60 plus percent digital downloads and a game like Battlefield cues even more to PCs, which means the download numbers going to be even higher. And what that Allows us to do, is make short-term price changes if we need to, but we don't have to cut big deals with retailers like we used to do historically. And I think that will bode well for us from an ability to sell through a lot of games, as well as not have to discount those games dramatically. Yeah. That's what I'm about to say. And I would just note following the number of characters that are now in the game versus on day 1 are dramatically different and just gives you a sense of how that game is continuing to evolve, not to mention the ways to play, the modalities, land, the maps and so forth. On the 23 questions, I think, you know this, because we've been talking about just business for a long time. We typically don't even start talking about 23 until our third quarter, and we don't really give guidance until the end of our fourth quarter. What I will tell you is we are very optimistic about '23 and that's possibly what we're trying to signal today in that optimism and excitement.  And I think the thing to remember is over 70% of our business is in a lot of services, and that comprises things like Ultimate Team, Apex, Mobile, The Sims. It is questioning the special sauce of what we do. It is bringing people together, make sure that they're part of a social network, and then continue to serve them content that keeps them engaged in what they love. And that is different than many other companies in the industry. We've always tried to help people understand about the breadth of our franchises. And when you think about live services in combination with our sports franchises, which have come out every year at the same time basically, for -- mainly the life of this Company.  And we 've built incredible live services around those sports franchises, which makes it a much safer business model than having to go build something from scratch and hope you get it out on time. And when you then broaden that across The Sims and Mobile titles. And then add live services to new titles like Battlefield that don't have real life services today, you have a much more stable and growing business for the future. So, we're very confident in growth for next year independent of any one title because of that live service component of our business. And we're very excited about what that means going forward, and the ability for us to continue to add and evolve those live services to be even bigger over time Hey, Andrew? We know. you Normally I just pointed him across the table, or he points at me. The Apex Legends, I'll start there, and to Andrew can talk a little bit about The Sims. We continue to work on how and why Apex works in certain markets. And there are certain markets, that it is unbelievable the strength of the franchise, where we haven't really done much of it than localized the language. Japan is a great example of that. And so, the team has been working hard, particularly on the Mobile build of the game to be able to localize it more to how people want to play the game in those markets. And then you want to be careful that you don't bifurcate the game in too many ways, but there may be some ways cosmetically or beyond language adjustments to make the game more powerful in those markets.  And you should have seen that soon, that's an ongoing process. It is hard to see and hard for us to carve that out as part of the financials. But trust that part of the reason that the business continues to grow as that we are doing that, you'll see much more of that as the mobile build, starts to go broad in the world where we're entering markets, where people have not played the game on console or PC because those aren't available to them.  And so, part of the markets that we're testing right now, are those types of markets where this is a new game for them, and so we're watching very closely as to how people play that, react to that, do they have positive or negative reactions to certain characters, for example, of certain types of gameplays. And that's part of why we want to take our time to make sure we test the Mobile build around the world because that's where it's the most powerful and where the most upside exist. Yes. I was just going to say we always spend time thinking about that and trying to manage it as best as possible. I think there's no doubt that there's going to be some wage inflation. The bulk of what you, if you're looking at our P&L, the bulk of what you see in terms of increases in Apex are due to the fact that we brought new people into the Company through acquisitions, as well as through new hires. I don't see a substantial wage inflation pressure, but we're always conscious of it and trying to manage that."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I hope all of you are well and staying healthy. Let me begin with a big thank you to our teams who continue to work from home and do amazing things for our players. I also want to extend a warm welcome to everyone at Playdemic who are now officially part about Electronic Ops team. We're thrilled to have them on board adding to our continued strength in sports and mobile. Q2 FY '22 was the strongest second quarter in the history of Electronic Arts. We're growing with our leading franchises, new launches, and large services all performing well during the quarter and our acquisition are driving additional growth beyond our core business. With more than 500 million unique active accounts, we're connecting players all over the world to each other, to a more about favorite content.  As a result, net revenue, net bookings, and EPS were above our Q2 guidance. And we're now raising our full-year net revenue, net bookings, and EPS guidance for the second time this fiscal year. Our core strategy is built on full key opportunities. The creation of amazing games and content. Tools for the community to engage more deeply with our experiences. The aggregation and distribution of content and experiences to an aggregated audience across platforms, business models, and geographies. And harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around down gains.  As part of this, we are executing against 3 growth drivers in FY '22, expanding our blockbuster franchises, building on our leadership in sports, and growing live services across our portfolio. I'll focus my comments on these today. With our talented creative teams, powerful IP and platform rates, we continue to grow leading blockbuster franchises. Experiences like EA sports FIFA, Apex Legends, Madden NFL, Battlefield, and The Sims, are some of the most prominent and powerful properties in all of entertainment. Apex Legends continues to grow as one of the top franchises in the industry. A brand-new IP that has scaled to more than a 100 million players and is closing in on a billion dollars in net bookings annually. Season 9 and season 10 introspectively set new marks for the highest active players of Season one.  And Q2 was the biggest quarter of income spending in Apex that we've had to date. Apex is growing beyond the game as well. It was one of the most watched titles on Twitch during the quarter with more than a $130 million hours of season 10 content watched to-date, up nearly 40% from the previous season. As the success of Apex Legends continues, it demonstrates how we are building long-term ecosystems in and around our biggest franchises. At its core is outstanding gameplay. Embedded in an immersive world of law and characters that continues to expand. Seasons of new content and in-game events like the recent collection event, keep the experience fresh for new and returning players. We've introduced new experiences like the squad-based arenas and recently added a ranked mode.  The Apex Legends eSports ecosystem is growing as well. With the second year of Apex Legends Global Series now on the way. Apex is moving from strength to strength. And we will add to that when we bring Apex Legends to mobile platforms later this year. Battlefield, another of our blockbuster properties in beloved by tens of millions of fans. Ahead of our upcoming Battlefield 2043 launch this month, 7.7 million players participated in the Battlefield 2042 open battle in October, including 3.1 million during the early access period, which is the largest early access event we've ever had.  This is an opportunity to take an early version of the game still in development, bring in a large audience into the experience and test and learn ahead of launch. With a small squad for the game in our open beta, we brought players into the full scale, 128 player combats, and many of the only in Battlefield moments that make this franchise so special. The engagement and feedback from players also helped out teams with areas of the game play to polish and refine as we move towards launch. We've now revealed all three of the game's pillars. [Indiscernible] 128 plan multi-play Income Quest and breakthrough modes. Battlefield portal, a new write-up play that has the community very excited to create their own Battlefield experiences and hazard zones with completely new squad focus combat and tactical gameplay that fans are going to love.  We're looking forward to play as getting to all of these experiences when the full battle for 233 game launches on November 19. Europe 0.22, we're continuing to grow our leadership in sports through new gains, acquisitions, and new areas of expansion. Our global football, or soccer for us in the North America franchise continues to be one of the leading game properties in the world, with approximately a 100 million players across all platforms in the first 6 months of the fiscal year. EA Sports FIFA 22, which launched at the very end of Q2, is off to the strongest start in franchise history. The innovation and our new Hot promotion technology revolutionized gameplay and has inspired, engaged in growing the community. Total players were up 16%, and [Indiscernible] franchise players are up nearly 50% year-over-year from launch. With net bookings also up significantly year-over-year from launch. We're seeing growth across the game with Ultimate Team engagement up 15% year-over-year, and more players coming into Volta and career modes.  There is strength in all areas of our global football franchise, including Mobile, will later this fiscal year, will bring new modes, new features, and improved gameplay that FIFA Mobile, creating our most rewarding mobile football experience today. For nearly 30-years, EA SPORTS has been driven to create the best global football franchise in the world. Moving forward, we're in a position to drive greater growth in line with the continued expansion and popularity of the sport.  With the talent of our development teams, our robust portfolio of more than 300 license part including the Premier League, UEFA, CONMEBOL, the Bundesliga, LaLiga, Serie A, the MLS, [Indiscernible], and many more. And our expertise in growth areas including e-sports and mobile. EA sports are ready to activate across the full spectrum of the football world. We have opportunities of new modalities of play, and new social experiences that will bring more fans together. As the sport grows, we have opportunities to expand cultural and lifestyle experiences through brand partnerships and content that our fans want more of in and around the game.  And we will continue to lead with the most innovative games on more platforms bringing the full breadth of the sport to the forefront from grassroots football to more of women's league teams and clients. We are more confident than ever about our broad future football and we will grow our franchises leadership with our partners around the world. We are continually investing in innovation, creativity, and all benches to bring EA SPORTS games close to the heart of real-world sporting fans. Engagement in Madden NFL '22 has grown each week of this NFL season as players jump into the refreshed Franchise Mode and Madden Ultimate Team to connect and compete with their friends.  We've grown the implementing business year-over-year as F1 2021 when Codemasters continues to bring in more players and keep fans engaged in one of the most intense F1 [Indiscernible] in years. NHL 22 launched in October, just as the NHL season began. With a new next-generation console experience delivering a dramatic new visual and gameplay leap for hockey fans. With a portfolio that now spend global football, American football, basketball, hockey, baseball, golf, UFC Fighting, and racing. No other entertainment provider in the world has the reach across top-level leagues, teams, and partners as EA SPORTS. We have a unique opportunity to bring together these properties and passionate [Indiscernible] enabling social connections through more innovative experiences and content.  Expanding a live service across our portfolio, particularly in mobile, is our third growth driver for FY 2022. In Q2, we closed the acquisition of Playdemic, creators of the massively successful Gulf clash mobile games. We're looking forward to combining our strength to continue the success of Gulf clash as a live service and bringing the clash mechanic to more of our sports franchises where our [Indiscernible] expertise will enable us to create some great new experiences. Our EA Mobile teams also continue to derive success in launch services, including Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which surpassed 100 million players last-to-date in Q2. Through the collective talent of the Glu Mobile, Playdemic, and EA Mobile teams.  We have built a powerful mobile [Indiscernible] of organization within a year. This group is shortly for accelerating growth in our portfolio. More than 15 top mobile live services, as well as introducing new experiences that takeout powerful IP, including Battlefield in the expanding mobile audience. The opportunities in front of us are exciting. We feel great about the position we are in with strong leaders, including our new Chief Operating Officer, managing Company-wide operations, creative leaders joining our management team, and our new Chief Executive Officer leading our efforts to grow social ecosystems. All supporting our 19 games as we drive growth in the next year of interactive entertainment. Now, I will turn the call over to Blake. Thanks, Blake. The holiday quarter is always an exciting time. We're looking forward to delivering amazing entertainment and connecting hundreds of millions of players around the world through each other throughout games and live services in the months ahead. I'm going to take the opportunity here to say thank you again to our incredible teams at electronic apps. Their commitment to creativity and innovation in service applies is second to none. And every day it is inspiring to work alongside such talented and dedicated people. It's been a strong year to date, and we're confident in our plans to drive continued growth in the years ahead. Now, Blake and I are here for your questions. Yes. And I would just cover up. The metrics that we're getting out of those games continues to be very strong. And so, we continue to be confident about the opportunity around both of them. And with respect to license negotiations, I would start by saying, we have great relations with all of our partners, all 300 of them, including FIFA. As we think about the future of football, we think the future is very bright. We are positive and very fabric of the cultural football globally and important part of fandom for football, and when we got to interact with hundreds of millions of football fans, they tell us they want more cultural brand involvement from across the globe. They want more modalities of play inside the game, which go beyond just straight 11 on 11 football. They want more digital experiences outside the game, eSports, NFTs, broader sports consumption. And they want us to move really, really quickly. And so, I would tell you as we think about the future of football within is very bright, we're going to work with our global collection of partners that will still best enable us to do that. And we'll continue our conversations with each and every one of them to the extent that they are aligned with that objective. What I talked about in the prepared remarks is that the Apex Legends team has really been very thoughtful and deliberate about the development and the building of this live service and the community support since the very beginning. And it starts with core gameplay. And what we've seen them be out to do with bringing more players each and every season. And kind of our weekly active in our monthly active players is grown throughout the cycle so far. They add new models of play, to things like ranked mode and arenas.  They add new events that are important and more deeply engage the community. And so, I think that as we think about live service on a go forward basis, you should expect that thing to continue to be thoughtful and deliberate. They'll continue to build out modalities of play, they'll continue to create more content, but also really work with the community-on-community level in events which really drive the most engagement over time. And we continue to be very confident this is going to be a really, really strong global franchise for us for at least a decade. Anything that brings more people in and engages those people for more time in a context with the extent that I think it's a good thing over time. I think that is the very foundation of our live services. I think the play-to-earn or the NFC conversation is still really, really early. And there's a lot of conversation and is at some level a lot of hype about it. I do think it will be an important part about the future of our industry on a go-forward basis. But it's still early to figure out how that's going to work. I feel good about our position with respect to that.  I mean, as a Company, we have been leaders in the creation of digital content that has real collectible value in the embedding of that content as part of large services and what we know about collection over time is that collectability is far more valuable to the collector, where the collected item has utility. And I think that in the context of the games that we create and the live services that we offer, Collectible digital content is going to play a meaningful part in our future. So still early to tell, but I think we're in a really good position and you should expect us to think more innovatively and creatively about that on a go-forward basis. I think when we -- sorry. I was going to say I think that when we look at across our mobile portfolio, we feel like we're in a really good position on a go-forward basis. We've got strong teams, got a strong IP, we've got a huge network of players, and we've got global reach. And we're already seeing the value of that when you think about our ability to offer EA IP for Glu Mobile folks, or our Playdemic folks to start thinking about new and interesting experiences.  I didn't think we've seen some softness in some of our games, particularly those that rely a little bit more needs acquisition. I think that will work through that over time. Again, creative talent, great IP, huge network applies in global reach allowance work through that and find a path through that. But net-net, I think that there is a little idea phase. But nothing that has us concerned about our ability to continue to grow our Mobile business overtime. Yeah. So, I think that on balance, the feedback from the beta was overwhelmingly positive. There were some conversations around some elements of the beta, which is not unnatural innovator. And we will be able to take that feedback around those elements -- those constructive elements and really implement that in the game. And again, I think what we had talked about with the community is, it was an earlier build of the game that we used for the beta as the team continues to work, and tune, and polish the final build for the game. So, we feel really good about that. I think when you think about the early access numbers and engaging numbers overall, you should read that as tremendous demand.  The game is very appealing, the setting is very appealing, the modalities of play, the innovation and creativity that does, and the other things to work on that game -- have put into the game is something that the community's receiving very, very well and is really, really excited about. I wouldn't read too much into the week before Black Friday, I get that on a calendar basis, that looks the same as Battlefield 5. I would tell you though needing the Battlefield 5, we did not see the level of demand we're seeing now.  We did not have the level of innovation and again that we have now. We didn't have new platform technology driving a high-fidelity gaming experience that we have now. And so net-net coming out of the beta, we feel very good about player demand, the team has been working very hard on tuning and polish and filing the game where we feel really good about the game that the committee is going to get to play on day one. And the team also has wonderful plans for the future large service. That stuff where there's notion of [Indiscernible] nearly engaging our players deeply in the ability to create their own Battlefield experiences. And so, we feel very good and confident about the future Battlefield at this stage. And I'll let Blake the second part. We continue to believe. Again, I go back to respond as a team, have been very deliberate and thoughtful about developing and building this franchise and nurturing and growing the community and their engagement over time. And I actually -- I think we're just at the beginning, I think there's such tremendous upside, and all that we're doing both in the existing experience on existing platforms and as we expand the Mobile. But again, I have nothing to announce today. But when you think about the broader ecosystem of experiences, we plan to offer, I wouldn't discount the notion of adding more modalities of play or even more tradition modalities of play to that experience, overtime. Do you want to give us a second question then we'll answer them? We'll, answer them both. Both really good questions. I think of that -- as we think about digital collectibles, particularly our sports games, again, in different across different franchise. And so, collectability has different value over time. And collectability games like FIFA, and Maden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time. And the short answer to that is yes. And the slightly longer answer to that is, we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players.  And we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy. And you're seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending that -- they're getting that value. But we will continue -- as we have evolved the Ultimate Team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players. To your second question around elevating studio GMs, for me it's a very pragmatic choice. When I think about the growth vectors for us as a Company inside of our industry, there is extraordinary games and content.  There were tools to more deeply engage the community, there will be aggregation and distribution of that content on aggregated audience. And there is an ecosystem born out of the engagement content, but exist beyond the [Indiscernible] gaming experience. At the end of the day, every one of those value drivers stops with the games and the content that we create. And so, for me it was really saying to our creative leaders. I want to make sure that you are in a strategic conversation, is going to help us drive growth as a Company. I think it is a very central strands of DNA of who we are.  They have demonstrated unbelievable leadership in our Company in support of our employees and in support of our fans and in the creation of amazing games and content. And this is a recognition that the next buys of growth of this Company are going to be born out of innovation and creativity across those 4 vectors but it will all start with that content. And as the leaders of the teams that create that content, I thought it was important to have them in the conversation. Yeah, when we think about all of our games and our big blockbuster franchises like Apex, like FIFA, like Madden, like Battlefield [Indiscernible] we're always thinking about innovation and creativity at its core, how do we build that out into modalities of play? How do we think about that across platform? How do we think about the extension those experiences and business model is 1 piece of that puzzle? I think when we look at our Battlefield franchise today with the knowledge that it probably makes sense to have a free-to-play component to that overall ecosystem in the future.  Job number 1 was truly a reinvention of the action shooter category and I think that's what they have seek -- sort of do. And that's what they've achieved through this 128-plan multiplayer [Indiscernible] expansion, deeper engagement in creativity to portal mode, and innovative new modes in and around the game. I think the next page of that is going to be the launch of the Battlefield Mobile total. And then as we continue to expand that -- and that in itself will serve tens of millions of players. I think as we ever think about further expanding apply those over time, free-to-play will make sense for the franchise, but it's not the focus right now. Yes. I'm not sure the notion of not being engaged in cosmetic content, is a fair assessment. I think that I don't feel premium, some number of years ago was kind of an innovation in the category that really extended the game experience out. 12, 18, 24 months. I think we saw deep engagements from the community in that. I think what we also sold out which we didn't get all of the community to engage deeply in that. And some parts the community want to engage in kind of a different profile. And so, we did away with premium, we've been kind of working with the community since then on different ways to extend and enhance the experience through live service. I feel good about what the team has planned now, I feel like it gives everybody in the community, which is probably bigger than 40 million players right now, an opportunity we extend and enhance their experience and engage.  Why that makes sense for them, but it doesn't bifurcate or trifurcate the community anyway. So, I think that this is a great community. I think they're a core community. I think the franchise and beloved amongst them. I think what we're seeing, even having been out of the market for 3 years, is demand and appeal continues to be incredibly high. And I'm excited about what we're going to launch with again, but I'm even more excited by the plans the team has taken and grow and expand that experience for global player. I don't have specific metrics on Pike conversion that I can share today. I'm going to say what we have seen in the combination of all of the new advancements we did in Ultimate Team, including one element which is the preview products. We've seen higher engagement and higher monetization overall. And as we've rolled that out, what we've seen is that we've converted a different level of spender or a different type of spender on the comics to preview packs. And so, what's clear to us is this is a really fun and new and innovative and creative way throughout our growing play [Indiscernible] engage with the most popular mode in the game. And we'll continue to evolve and offer new things. And as I said earlier, we're always trying to figure out a way to offer new place of value for our players, and new reasons for them to engage and connect with their friends through the experience. On the notion of could -- evolve into other areas. I think the shortage that is absolutely. I think what we're seeing is that the surprise and delight of the traditional surprise mechanic continues to be something that is really fun and rewarding for this pond apply base. And then there's another group applies -- want to think differently about how they extended enhance their experience.  And you should expect that we will take the learning from FIFA across the portfolio and learning from elsewhere in the portfolio, things like our Mobile business, and things like Apex Legends, bring that back into our sports franchises. So, part of the benefit of having the breadth and depth of the portfolio that we have across sports and action and lifestyle, and having 0.5, billion implied in our network engaging deeper in the experiences that we offer is that we get tremendous learning across the portfolio and we're going to look to continue to do great things for our players as we learn from franchise-to-franchise. I thought you might grab that one, Blake, sorry, Yeah, and on The Sims again, The Sims is one of the great franchises about industry and exists in a category where we have very little competition as lost doll category. The Sims continued to do well with all engagement metrics up year-over-year. with Q2 bookings were up 32% year-over-year. In July, we released colleagues leading our 11th expansion pack, which quickly became one of the most popular packs we've ever done, Android performance. Well above our internal focus to the franchisees.  So, I guess I think this is a growing player base in the seams, the franchise's continued to grow. And I would tell you, again, we had a lot to talk about other than The Sims today. We'll come back and share more in the future, but that team continues to think about how to grow that franchise. Even more than this a -- in a category and with a player base that is very different from the rest of that portfolio. Great question. Again, it's still relatively early for these integrations. And Playdemic is really, really early. But what I would tell you is, as we've thought about this, we really think about it across 3 vectors. Which is the core credit teams and how to best get value there and we have built a single Mobile organization out of our EA Mobile teams Playdemic and Glu on the Jeff Koppers, who is an industry veteran but has more than a decade in Mobile leadership. And is really rethinking and building a strong forward-looking strategy around Mobile for us. The second element is IP, and when we did these acquisitions, we talked about both sport and lifestyle. TAP Sports, baseball, Golf Clash, Design Home, Covet Fashion, FIFA, Madden, UFC, hockey, The Sims.  And so, part of what was going that before is we start to think about the integration. We have gone through; we're working on seems to -- we were working on this thing. It probably doesn't make that much sense to build that game when you can take that engine on apply it to the FIFA business, the TAP Sports engine, or the Gulf clash engine to football -- European football or American football. And we're in that planning phase right now and I would say the teams themselves, they're are really excited to take that core underlying technology and really apply to franchises that have global reach and global strength. The third is just kind of our network at play and how we start to work across that.  Glu has a tremendous advertising engine. And we're starting to think about how to tight that advertising engine across our client network into our other products. We're already starting to see the benefit. And then things like reach, we've already been able to launch TAP Sports, Baseball into Japan. And so, some early wins in what is still an early phase of integration. But I'm really encouraged by what Jeff is doing as the leader of this business, what I think we're going to get out of Mobile -first talent on global portfolio of IP, a network of half a billion players and global reach. And I think you should watch this space because there's lots of great things coming over the next 12, 24, 36 months in the place of Mobile. I'm sorry. Go ahead Go ahead. Sorry. And I will just say I think we are committed as an organization. We're very thoughtful with that compensation for all of our people to ensure that we keep pace with the market, and they are fairly rewarded for the amazing work they do. And so far, we have been able to do that really well. And I think we'll continue to do that in the future. It's an ongoing question. I think there is no straight answer to that. I think there's a lot -- we've got a lot of questions to the response engines are very inception of Apex Legends launch. As I continue to say, that team is being very deliberate and very thoughtful and works very closely with the community. They have in fact staffed up dramatically. They've got more people in LA, they've going another team in Vancouver that continues to work on the game and grow and develop more content.  I would say I think this team more than just about any other team in our Company and perhaps the industry, they have a very deep understanding of the player base and the community and they are building for the long-term. And so, the short answer is, could we deliver more content? Possibly. Does that make sense? Maybe. But what I do is I trust that team to be very close to [Indiscernible] thoughtful about how they build and develop that content over time, and that will mean sometimes that every 3 months, sometimes that it will be longer and some time it will be shorter.  But what we have seen them do and demonstrate now since the very inception is their ability to maintain player sentiment, to be a hard the best talent into their organization and continue to grow the business over time. And I think that they will continue to do that for many, many years in the future. So, with that, we'll wrap up the call there. Thank you, everyone for joining us and for great questions. Be well, and we'll speak with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Bye So,"

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q1 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Christina. Welcome to EA's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me today from their homes are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we'll post our prepared remarks and audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q2 fiscal 2022 earnings call is scheduled for Wednesday, November 3. And as a reminder, we posted schedule of our entire fiscal year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation includes - and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today, and Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, August 4, 2021, and disclaims any duty to update it. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year than is otherwise stated. Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. I hope all of you are continuing to stay healthy. I want to start out today by thanking all of our amazing teams across Electronic Arts, who continue to create and deliver so many great experiences for our players during this unprecedented period. It's been an exciting few months since our last call. We've unveiled Battlefield 2042. We've launched F1 2021. We've showed what is coming with our next Madden NFL and FIFA titles. We had a fantastic EAPlay-live event with great fan response, and we've announced the acquisition of Playdemic, which is another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and growing in mobile. Integration efforts with the teams at Codemasters, Blue Mobile and Metalhead are going well, and we're pleased to be building a lot of anticipation through the summer for our upcoming games and content. Looking at our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered very strong results. Even as the world took steps towards opening back up, we deepened engagement and connections for players in and around our games. And we see this trend going well into the future. Our talented teams are delivering experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play, and our new launches, leading games and life services all performed very well during the quarter. Execution against our long-term strategy continues to power growth in our business. Revenue, net bookings and EPS were all above our guidance for Q1. We are raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance today, and we are also forecasting our biggest second quarter ever. Our long-term strategy is focused on 4 key opportunities: the continued creation of great games and content with a focus on mobile, tools for the community to drive deeper engagement with our content, the aggregation and distribution of content and services to more platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, in FY '22, we continue to execute against 3 key growth drivers: building on our leadership in sports; growing our blockbuster franchises; and expanding live services across our portfolio, including mobile. EA SPORTS continues to extend its leadership position through the global strength of our franchises and growing portfolio. More than 140 million players have engaged with our EA SPORTS games over the last 12 months. At the center of this, our FIFA franchise is growing around the world. Over 31 million players have joined FIFA 21 on console and PC since launch, and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to engage more soccer fans, which FUT matches up 48% year-over-year in Q1. In China, FIFA Online 4 set all-time records for monthly, weekly and peak daily active players, driving new records for our business there. On a global basis, FIFA is growing as part of the social fabric of soccer, and we are connecting players through our games and live services on more platforms and more geographies than ever. We've also launched F1 2021, the first F1 experience to be part of our EA SPORTS portfolio in nearly 20 years. With an incredibly high-quality game that has won praise from fans and critics, F1 2021 is bringing fans into the excitement of the sport during one of the most memorable seasons in recent history. Sales were up significantly year-over-year, and total active players have grown by nearly 10% since launch over last year's game, demonstrating the power that comes from the amazing team at Codemasters, a great game, and our EA distribution and marketing strength. Momentum continues to build for F1, which like soccer is one of the few truly global sports, and we see a major opportunity to continue growing the franchise to reach a larger audience of players and viewers. Later this summer, we will begin launching our strong next-gen slate for EA SPORTS, that includes Madden NFL 22 with new experiences in franchise mode and The Yard; FIFA 22, which is already showing very strong demand metrics as our new hyper motion technology powered innovation throughout the game; NHL coming to next-gen consoles for the first time; an EA SPORTS PGA Tour, the only game where you can exclusively play all 4 of golf's major tournaments, the Masters at Augusta National, the Open Championship, the U.S. Open Championship and the PGA Championship. We're also thrilled to be back in the baseball business with Super Mega baseball and MLB Tap Sports on mobile, and we look forward to sharing more from those teams in the future. With the strength of our industry-leading EA SPORTS teams, the addition of talent and expertise from Glu, Codemasters, Metalhead and soon Playdemic as well as partnerships with international developers, we have exciting plans to create more EA SPORTS experiences for fans around the world to play, watch and connect. Our second growth driver is building blockbuster entertainment properties around our IP. This year, this is led by Apex Legends and Battlefield, 2 of the leading franchises in their category. Apex Legends continues to accelerate as one of the top titles in the industry. During Season 9, we've averaged more than 13 million weekly active players. We've set a new record for peak daily players across all seasons, and the 3 latest in-game events have driven the highest play accounts for events to date. In every season and event, the Respawn team is constantly innovating, trying new things and gathering feedback to evolve the live service. And as a result, player engagement and investment continues to grow. Respawn is now expanding the game beyond battle royale with new experiences like arenas, which has brought new and lapsed players into the game and opens the door for deeper esports opportunities. With so much excitement in the community for the future of Apex Legends, we see outstanding growth ahead for this powerful global franchise. During Q1, we revealed Battlefield 2042, and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible. Since the reveal on June 9, our Battlefield trailers and content have cumulative generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels. These record leadership levels contributed to Battlefield 2042 being the most talked about title in the industry during a busy month of June and created a record high sentiment among the Battlefield fan community. More recently, we introduced Battlefield Portal, a new community-driven experience in Battlefield 2042. This new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in Battlefield, easily mixing and matching ears, maps, weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community. It's an entirely new level of freedom in Battlefield, and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create, discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected. We are poised to deliver a truly next-gen Battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation, massive scale and amazing gameplay, and we have more to share about the game through the summer. There is enduring power to the franchisees and IP that we are building. The launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the remaster of the first 3 Mass Effect games, reignited the passion of fans around the world, driving sales performance well above our expectations. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 was also a moment for new and returning players to jump into that amazing game. We're continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing IP. Our third growth driver is live services, our core strength and continuing growth opportunity for us, and mobile is now a significant part of this. With the addition of Glu, our portfolio now spans more than 15 top mobile live services and we will add the top sports mobile title in the industry with Golf Clash when Playdemic joins EA. The breadth and diversity of our mobile live services now spans multiple major genres, including casual, sports, RPG lifestyle and racing. Over the past year, we've expanded our mobile-native talent. And with their leadership, we are now growing these titles to reach new and broad audiences on a global scale. We're also delivering our blockbuster franchises to mobile players, including Apex Legends and Battlefield experiences rolling out for mobile later this year. With the ability to bring new teams together with EA's powerful IP, we are building mobile into a growth center for Electronic Arts with long-running live services at the core of our strategy. Underpinning these growth drivers are the fact that games, and particularly our portfolio experiences at Electronic Arts, are creating social connection for more and more people around the world. More than 0.5 billion players are coming together through the social networks formed in and around our games, and we see this continuing to grow. With some of the most talented teams in the industry, a deep pipeline of innovative experience in established and new IP, new content partnerships and more ways to connect and experience play, we are positioning our business for continued growth and leadership this year and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake.\nBlake Jorgensen: Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launched at the very end of the prior quarter and showed considerable strength through Q1. Live services also performed better than expected, led by continued growth in Apex Legends. As a result, we delivered net revenue of $1.55 billion and net bookings of $1.34 billion. Given the extraordinary engagement driven by the blockbuster - by the lockdown a year ago and the fact that last year's quarter had 14 weeks compared to this year's 13, to deliver results within 5% of last year's record sales is an incredible testament to the strength of our game teams and our ability to deliver games and extra content from our ongoing live services. The extra week last year Q1 alone is worth more than the year-on-year difference. Notably, even against the unique circumstances of a year ago, Apex Legends grew strongly in the quarter and remains on track to grow organically more than 20% this year with the mobile launch as an upside. Because of the impact of the pandemic on year-on-year over comparisons, it's helpful to compare this quarter with the pre-COVID Q1 fiscal 2020 to better understand underlying growth. On that basis, FIFA Ultimate Team is up 47%; Madden Ultimate Team, up 115%; equivalent to CAGRs of 21% and 47%, respectively. Similarly, sales, including Codemasters from our broad portfolio of catalog titles are up 55%, a CAGR of 25%. Mobile, excluding our Glu acquisition, is also up 16% organically over the same period 2 years ago. We have also made considerable progress on our strategic goals as we started to integrate Codemasters, completed the acquisitions of Gul Mobile and Metalhead and announced our agreement to acquire Playdemic. These acquisitions substantially increase our sports and mobile footprint and offer the opportunity to bring new sports to formats pioneered by MLB Tap Sports Baseball, Super Mega Baseball, and Golf Clash. We only launched F1 2021 a few weeks ago, but we're already seeing sell-through up more than 20% over last year's addition, thanks to another great game from the Codemasters team leveraged by our global commercial operation. We have created a historically strong strategic position for the company with a strong and growing core of live service supplemented by additional growth opportunities in sports opened up by the acquisition plus blockbuster releases, as demonstrated by the community reaction to our upcoming Battlefield 2042. Digital represents 58% of our full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. Operating expenses, which include recent M&A costs, came in slightly below our expectations. Now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.85 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.921 billion and earnings per share of $1.58, up from $1.34. Our guidance does not include any estimate for Playdemic given that, that acquisition has not yet closed. And remember, this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $100 million to $7.4 billion based on performance from full game sales this quarter, supported by ongoing confidence in our live services. It's very rare that we raise guidance this early in the year. And I would note that despite the clear strength of player interest so far, it is too soon to raise our unit expectations for Battlefield 2042. As a result, the stronger product mix we are now anticipating for this year, we are raising our expectations for underlying, profit and more specifics are in the downloadable model that we post on our website. Underlying the strength of our strategic position, I would briefly note that even with the strength we expect for fiscal 2022, we expect growth in the mid- to high single digits in fiscal 2023. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.85 billion, with capital expenditures remaining around $250 million. That would deliver free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.775 billion, cost of revenue to be $518 million and operating expenses of $1.030 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter. We expect Q2 fiscal 2012 net bookings to be $1.725 billion, which would make it our largest Q2 ever, driven by the launch of FIFA, continued growth of Apex Legends plus Mobile, F1, Madden and The Sims. This is up 90% on a year ago quarter. With another great quarter under our belts, we're looking forward to the launches of our sports titles this quarter and Battlefield 2042 in time for the holidays. Our strategic position has never been stronger, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. I'd like to announce one thing, and that is our Chief Accounting Officer, Ken Barker, has decided to retire from EA. Many of you know Ken. He's interacted with investors and the buy-side and sell-side for years. Ken has done an amazing job as a Chief Accounting Officer over the last 18 years as well as supporting 3 CEOs and the management team during his time at the company. In addition, he has been a fantastic business partner for me over the last 9 years. He has developed an amazing team of people that support our business and exceptional leaders that will be able to carry on his strong support of the company. Ken's groomed a very strong person to take over the Chief Accounting Officer role, Eric Kelly, who I think many of you also know. Eric also has been with EA for 18 years in all of our key markets around the world, Europe, Asia and North America. And he has all the skills and strengths to fill the very large shoes that Ken has worn for years. We're lucky that Ken has agreed to assist in the transition over the next 9 months. So he'd be with us until after we close our fiscal year. And I thank Ken for an amazing commitment to EA and his fantastic partnership. So with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. We lost, Andrew?\nAndrew Wilson: Sorry. Minor glitch. Thank you, Blake. I'd like to echo your thoughts and sentiments and say thank you, Ken, for all of your outstanding contributions to Electronic Arts. We'll miss you. As I started this call, I again want to thank our teams for everything they continue to do in service of our players around the world. Thanks to their efforts, we're bringing hundreds of millions of players together through our games and live services like Apex Legends. We're delivering great new experiences like F1 2021 and Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and we have even more amazing content to come. It's been a strong start to our fiscal year. Our growth drivers, leadership in sports, building blockbuster franchises and growing live services, including mobile, are accelerating our business, and we're well positioned for continued growth this year and beyond. Now Blake and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Printers.\nEric Handler: The first question, real quickly with F1. I wonder if you could compare how marketing for the game has changed on a year-over-year basis. And then I've got a follow-up to that.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I would tell you, I just think that when you think about how we go to market with our games, we have global reach. We have extraordinarily digital capabilities and kind of data-driven marketing processes that allows us to better target both existing players, lapsed players and potential new players. And I think what we've been able to do as an organization is take that strength, partner that with an extraordinary game team at Codemasters and what is also a spectacular game in the middle of an F1 season that is more interesting than any season in recent history with the competition between Hamilton and Verstappen kind of hotting up. And the combination of all those things together has meant that we've seen growth in the franchise and expect to continue to grow that franchise over time.\nEric Handler: Great. And then I assume - should we assume this year there's going to be live services for F1? And was there any consequential live services with last year game?\nAndrew Wilson: It would - this game is early in the partnership between Codemasters and EA SPORTS. So a lot of how we think about the future live service of that business and sustaining that community and that fan base and play base over time is going to continue to evolve. There is some this year but not as extensive as certainly we think we will get to over the course of time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.\nAndrew Marok: Blake, I know you want to briefly mention it, but I want to see if you could go into a bit more color. Typically, you don't kind of give plus 1 year guidance out or - so when you're thinking about growing mid-double digits for next fiscal year, could you give us any color on how that's going to be achieved? Is it more of the same? But any additional color to help us kind of piece together how we should think about that growth rate.\nBlake Jorgensen: Sorry. I was on mute. Sorry about that. So what I was saying is, first and foremost, focus on the acquisitions that we've done. And those, on their own, will create substantial uptick in both top line growth and bottom line growth as we look at continuing to fuel those acquisitions and then use those talent bases to start to build out new titles that we can add to our overall portfolio. Second, think about Apex Mobile. We've said that we have very little in this year. We're in test market, and we should be out in the global markets in China next year, if not earlier. That could be a huge driver in profitability going forward. We have the potential of live services around Battlefield as well as a Battlefield mobile game coming up. And we clearly have other games planned, such as a Need for Speed or others that are coming, which you'll hear more about in the future. But you can imagine. We try to operate the business on a 5-year cadence if not longer, and we're thinking about how do we generate growth each year, both organic and through acquisitions. And I would tell you I think we are in a better position than we've ever seen before.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. I appreciate that, considering it's so far out. The next question - and I'll bring it back to current times. Could you walk us through the pushes and takes of how we should think about the impact FIFA has on this quarter versus what it will have on the December quarter considering the shift in launch date?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. So I know not everyone on the street has seen this, and it's not clear for a lot of people. We'll ship FIFA on technically October 1, which means we actually ship it a little earlier for people who are part of our subscription program, for example. But we will capture some revenue, as we've shown in our guidance for this quarter in Q2. we'll also capture revenue in Q3. And usually, the first 1 to 2 quarters of FIFA are the biggest quarters because people are building their ultimate teams. And so we'll see strong growth both this quarter and next quarter off of FIFA with the shift being that it's dropping in Q2, which last year, it only dropped in Q3 when we started it, but it should make a huge difference. And for the full year, obviously, we wouldn't have generated - or said that we were going to grow for a full year and increase our guidance if we weren't confident about FIFA as well as other products.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the Dead Space franchise and what you guys are expecting from the reboot there. And secondly then, on the name image likeness development? And maybe to what extent do you think including realized college athletes is something that you guys are focused on. And from a development perspective, how quickly could you add that to one of your games versus using generic players?\nAndrew Wilson: Two great questions. Having just provided a very small trailer on Dead Space, there's - or a sweet preview on Dead Space, there's no lot more I can share about that. It's a little ways out yet, but the studio has taken it on. What I can say is it's one of the great games from our catalog there has been extraordinary demand to bring it back for existing players and next generation of players, and we're excited to kind of add that to the portfolio over time. And we'll be able to share more as development continues. But I would just - I would close on that point by saying it was one of the most demanded titles for us, maybe just after Skate, which we've also announced we're bringing back, and the response was very positive to the announcement that we're back in development. Around name image and likeness, again, we believe that we can build an extraordinary college football game in the absence of naming and lightness in partnership with the schools and in partnership with the conferences, and we're looking to do that. I also believe with what we have seen most recently in and around an image likeness that is very plausible and likely very possible for us to integrate name image and lightness with athletes according to whatever rule sets may emerge as to how they may engage with us in that context. And we are building the architecture of the game with a database structure so that if and when that comes online, we'll be able to add back to the game very seamlessly.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great quarter, guys. Awesome. Blake, that was exciting to see. Two questions. First 1 on FIFA Ultimate Team, look like in the quarter, maybe subsequent, you tested some 3D packs, which was sort of an alternative to loop boxes. So just curious of your learnings there from that test event. And the second question, just looking at the competitive landscape on FIFA. It looks like you shifted to football free to play? So just curious how you're thinking about how that sort of changed in the competitive environment.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, two great questions. On preview packs, the short answer is it was very well received by the community. Our FIFA Ultimate team are always working very closely with our community of players. FIFA Ultimate Team is the most played mode in that game by a wide margin. And we're always working to offer new and innovative and creative ways to engage, connect with your friends, connect with the world of football and build your ultimate team. Premium pack, as I said, was well received. We saw an increase in engagement, and we saw a higher rate of conversion of spenders. I would say it was coming down towards the end of the season. So some of this data has to be taken in that context. But the team is committed to continue to innovate in and around the offers and the programs that we put together for our players and believe that we can continue to grow that business over time. With respect to Pro Evolution Soccer change names football and going through to play, we've seen this happen before. I would tell you we're very committed to our soccer business. We're very committed to our player base. We continue to grow that player base. We've listened to our community over the years, and we've gone out and got much of the license content that underpins an authentic football game exclusively and continue to invest deeply not just in modes of play but in core gameplay to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience for our global player base. And what you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks is as a result of the innovation in and around hypermotion, we're seeing extremely strong demand for the upcoming version of FIFA, and engagement in that franchise continues to grow. So again, competition is always good. We're always very closely cognizant of what competition is doing. But our commitment is to our player base and delivering the most comprehensive, broad-based, authentic football game on the planet. And we believe we have the best team to do that, and we'll look to continue to do that over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe two, if I could, and these are actually things you hit on in earlier questions. I guess just coming back to, Blake, on the commentary for next year, I'm just curious if that guidance is dependent on any big, frontline title. Obviously, this year, you've got Battlefield. I'm curious if that's dependent on any larger title for next year. Somewhat relatedly, I'm curious thoughts around Battlefield. Does that franchise still aspire to be in every other year release type of a cadence in a normal world? Just curious if there have any updated thoughts there. And then just finally around some of the collegiate sports given some of the changes going on there, I'm curious if there's any interest around basketball with NBA Live, a little bit dormant here. I'm wondering if there's any pivot in any interest there?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. All good questions. I would say next year - and this is a testament to our business. Next year is a collection of great franchises all coming to play and new franchises. So new franchises in mobile, new franchises across our business, in places like F1 and other driving games and new franchises or existing franchises that we will bring back that - like NCAA or PGA Golf that we've talked about. And you know what? We've always tried to build the business on a collection of great titles, not one title because one title always poses risk. And so our view is a collection of the titles with great live services associated with them - and you're going to see that over the next - not just next year but for the next many years to come. That's how we've tried to build our business. And I think you'll hear more about it. We're not trying to give guidance right now on next year. But we did say in our prepared remarks that we're confident of growth going forward even after an incredible growth there this year and last year. And we feel like we're on a really good path to continue to try to grow this business, and we're seeing the great reception for our products in the marketplace. So more to come on that. We'll give you guys more details as we get closer. We know that's what you want. But you should just trust that we're confident that we're seeing and we're planning both top line and bottom line growth going forward. And now I don't remember your next two questions.\nAndrew Wilson: Let me jump in. On do we think Battlefield will return to an every other year launch, I would say - I think that is our orientation. But more importantly, I think you should think about Battlefield as a service what we announced - what we're doing for the launch of this game is really revolutionizing and reinventing what - all our epic scale warfare is in the context of gameplay. In addition to that, we've heard us announce Battlefield Portal, which really starts to lean into user-generated content and will drive deep long-term engagement in the game. And while we've announced Hazard Zone is a name we have to disclose a lot about what's going on there, and you'll hear more about that in the coming months, you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around Battlefield is, which over time will include a mobile launch, will include some free to anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch. So that while - and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today. We're really focused on 365-day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on. Then I think your - the other part of your question was naming lightness college sports and does that open up an opportunity on basketball. I would tell you our focus right now is football. But what you've also heard us talk about is really building on our strength in sports. We believe this is a unique strength for us. We're the leading company when it comes to delivering multiple high-quality sports across - at global scale, and it would not be a match for us in a world where we start to develop more into college football to start expand that to other college sports as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nMario Lu: First one is on Battlefield. So you mentioned you're not updating your unit sales estimate for the title for - deposit response to sales. So I just wanted to hear your thoughts on in terms of in-app purchases with an upcoming title. How should we frame the opportunity with that new monetization channel as historically with monetized with CSD?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. What I would say is that don't take our comments on not updating the guidance on Battlefield in any way as a negative. It is - we ultimately expose the world to Battlefield later than we normally would do. Normally, we do it through early June, E3 or maybe even earlier than that, and we did it in early July. So we're trying to make sure we pace the disclosure about what's in the game to people and then measure our demand off of that. But we're feeling very, very positive about it. And we wouldn't have raised our full year guidance if we didn't feel that was a potential for us, and I think it's an upside for the company longer term during the year. You're going to hear a lot more over the next couple of months about Battlefield live services, in-game monetization and so forth. I can't tell you all that now, but trust that the team is working very hard on this, and they have some very unique ideas about what we can continue to do, what Andrew just said, to create this as a long-term interaction with our consumers versus simply selling a game this year. And we want to build a long-term relationship as we have with Battlefield users for a long time. Portal is a perfect example of how that works, and you'll see more of that and more details about that over the next couple of months.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks, Blake. And just one on mobile. In terms of the acquisition of Playdemic, that makes a lot of strategic spend given that you're building down in support. Can you talk about just the near- and long-term synergies we should expect from this acquisition?\nBlake Jorgensen: Well, I would say with all of our acquisitions that we've done - we've done 4 now if you include Playdemic, which is not yet closed, you're going to see clearly some synergies, synergies in terms of management teams, synergies in terms of go-to-market strategies, marketing strategies and so forth. Most of these companies are smaller. They are exceptional in how they develop games. But as you've seen with F1 already, we've been able to drive more sales than what we've seen historically with that business, and we'll continue to do that across all of the portfolio of companies. I would say in the case of Playdemic and in the case of Glu, Tap Sports Baseball and Metalhead with their baseball game and Playdemic's golf game, we are going to leverage their strengths as best as possible to try to find ways to create more and better casual games in mobile - on mobile than we have in the past. And that's not to say that we haven't done a good job on mobile. We have, but the potential that we have - if you look at what Playdemic's done, the potential we have with something like a global FIFA game or a global Madden game where we already have the licenses, there is huge upside. I can't give you what those numbers look like yet. But I will tell you that the reason we did these deals was to try to make sure we brought the talent in that could help us expand our capabilities on more casual sports games around the globe and more casual games in general around the globe. And we're pretty excited about it. And I'd tell you, the mobile teams have worked very closely with the new teams at Playdemic or Glu or Metalhead or Codemasters, and they've come up with some amazing ideas on what we could do together.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jamie Bass with Berenberg.\nUnidentified Analyst: Two questions from me, please. Firstly, it looks like engagement is still holding up very well. But are you seeing any sort of different trends in markets where restrictions eased more versus markets where there's still more a lockdown at the moment? And then secondly, with the F1 game, that looks like it's been very well received through reviews and everything. Is that so far going in terms of sales and engagement? Is that going broadly how you expected it? Or is there any outperformance versus your internal expectations?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I would say just on the F1 game, I think we've exceeded our expectations. There's no negative on the F1 team because they are exceptional. it was could we quickly - I mean we didn't own the business for that long. So could we quickly integrate the teams, our marketing and publishing efforts to try and drive that business as fast as we did? That's probably where we might have had some questions. And actually, we've well exceeded that - And it's to the testament of an exceptional game development team that was able to produce the right assets, to produce the right marketing materials to help us drive this business and the teams working together. And you know what? I think we don't get enough credit for that. But EA is a bunch of people who really can work well together. And we do a great job of working with other parts of our company. And when we bring in acquisitions, we work well with them. And I think the poster child there is you look at Respawn and you look at what's happened with Apex. This is a team effort. And Respawn as obviously driven the amazing development of Apex, but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now - it's coming up to almost $2 billion in business over 2 years. That's unheard of in our industry. And I'm not sure we get enough credit for it. I don't really care. But at the end of the day, it is amazing what our teams are able to do. I would tell you, to your earlier part of the question, we've tried to put together great marketing for all of the companies that we've acquired, and it doesn't - it happens quick. And F1 has been a great example of that, and you have to have great products to do that. And so I would tell you that the combination of great teams and great marketers is really powerful in this industry, and I think we've been able to prove that we can do that across all the acquisitions that we've done in the last 4 or 5 years.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. And I would jump in. On your point around restrictions and are we seeing anything different, I would tell you given the rollercoaster nature of opening up and shutting down and lockdowns and various restrictions that are happening in various geographies and territories globally, it's almost hard to track at this juncture who is open and who is closed. What I would tell you though in aggregate is we have seen strength across our business, across all territories regardless of being open or closed. I think the performance this quarter is a testament to that. And at some level, this is largely due to what we see in our games is it's not just about a connection to content that people may be able to forgo in the context of returning to school or returning to work or returning to kind of general life. It's about connections to friends that they had prior to playing and they made during playing that people keep coming back to. And as we think about building ongoing interactive entertainment experiences, this is why you hear us leading into the social ecosystems in and around our games because this is what drives longevity and it's what drives deepening engagement in our business. And so I think what we're seeing right now is the world is in different phases in different places. But on aggregate, engagement in and around our games continues to be extremely strong.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost: It's Matt on for Brian. Two, if I could. So just on the strength of Apex in the quarter, obviously, the comp was extremely hard. So that's a pretty impressive feat. Are there any specific initiatives or pieces of content or geographies that you would call out that have sort of been the source of that outperformance year-on-year for Apex. And then just secondly, on the mobile side, we've heard from some peers in the mobile gaming space that they've seen very little impact to their ROI on advertising after the recent changes to app tracking on iOS and other that they've seen sort of an increase in UA spend being necessary? I'm wondering what experience you guys are having on the mobile side there.\nAndrew Wilson: Let me jump in on Apex and then maybe Blake could hit the kind of the mobile ad piece. The only thing I would tell you is it's not just any one thing. I think what I talked about in my prepared remarks is the very detailed nature that the Respawn team and the Apex team takes the ongoing development of this experience and the support of the growing global communities. And it's really about - on any given day, it's really thinking about what enhancement, extensions, innovations they can add to core gameplay, that moment-to-moment gameplay. There is - how can they think about new modalities of play like arenas, which changes kind of the broader rule set of how you engage in that moment to moment gameplay. And how do they add content with the legend and with all of those - the extra stuff in and around that, that drives more interest. And I think what we're seeing now is that team really started to deeply understand using data and using a close relationship they have with the community, continue to enhance gameplay, continue to add modalities of play and continue to double down on a really interesting, unique content that the community really gravitates towards. And I think as you think about that in the context, we're now taking that new geographies and new platforms. This is why we're so confident in the ongoing strength of that franchise.\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. And what I would say on the advertising side is right or wrong, we've never had a large advertising business. It covers around $100 million a year. Part of that is our strategy that we have not wanted people to leave our network. And if you look at most advertising on mobile, it's for other mobile games. And what that means is you're willing to allow people to leave your network to go play somewhere else. We're working with Glu right now and with Playdemic on their views on advertising, and we may change our views over time. We think it's important - in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it, but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road if that's where we want to go. And more to come on that. We're just - we're still in the learning stage relative to how we managed advertising in the past. We know the current rules, new rules make it even more challenging. And so we're trying to figure out what are the right ways to do advertising for you to play a world where people are willing to pay via an advertising app or an advertising video or whatever it is versus pay to play the game. And we'll see how that plays out over time.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. The one thing I would add there is while it hasn't been a giant business for us, what we have seen as Glu has kind of joined us is they actually have been significantly better at monetizing through advertising than we have been. They come with some really strong underlying technology. They come with really strong underlying expertise. And our sense is while it's still early, our sense is the combination of that technology, that expertise, our broader base of portfolio and the global reach it has likely means there's upside opportunity for us even in today's world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.\nGerrick Johnson: So last quarter, you said that guidance did not include potential synergies from Glu and Codemasters, and now you've had 3 months to integrate. It sounds like you've identified some F1, for instance, not just cost synergies but some revenue synergies there. So your guidance, you increased about 1 quarter beat and then $0.01. So what synergies have you identified? And are they now included in your guidance?\nBlake Jorgensen: So no cost synergies are included in our guidance. Clearly, revenue synergies are occurring as they occur. As you pointed out, we did better at F1 than we thought we would. Those are harder to predict. But we haven't yet implanted cost synergies in our OpEx line. For example, changes in executives, changes in staffing, changes - either positive or negative. You should assume that there are going to be some changes, and we will layer those into guidance over the next 3 to 6 months. We've been very focused on making sure we're bringing the company in as successful as possible and then determining what is the right way to drive synergies. But I would tell you is - there are potential large synergies across all of the acquisitions we've made, which would normally happen, but we'll see more of those over the next few quarters, and we'll try to keep everyone appraised of that.\nGerrick Johnson: Okay. Great. And last year, when you launched your sports games. There were cardboard cutouts in the stands. This year, we're going to have full stands with fans and stands. How much of a lift do you think it provides your games with sports actually happening and people in the stands?\nBlake Jorgensen: Well, I'll pull Andrew to answer that, but I hope we actually get to real people in the stands because we might go the other way right now. So who knows?\nAndrew Wilson: That was going to be my point. It's hard to understand exactly where the world is going to go. I think it's unlikely that we have events without fans in the stadiums, and we may just see some protocols around masks and/or testing and/or vaccination. But our whole sports fans is that we get fans back in stadiums. I think what you saw us do last year was really leading to the fact that for many people, we were sport at a time where it's really hard to engage or consume support more broadly. That did, in fact, allow us to grow both the amount of people playing our games and the engagement they had. I don't know that we can quantify what that means when everyone really gets to live the forms of sports on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, season-to-season basis, but it will inevitably have a positive uplift to just overall fan and player sentiment and will almost certainly drive deeper engagement in our games. And our teams will look to build stronger connection between what has happened in the real world of sport and what is happening in our games. So net-net, notwithstanding any further challenges around the pandemic, it's almost certainly a positive for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James.\nAndrew Marok: I wanted to drill down a bit on Ultimate Team. And is there anything to call out there maybe on newer players that have come into the ecosystem over the last 12 to 18 months? How is that cohort's behavior compared to more established cohorts? And has there been any notable difference in newer player behavior from things like reopening?\nBlake Jorgensen: Yes. I would say that we always have newer players come in as the game grows. Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1, one, because they got to understand how to play it; two, they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens, we start to see growth. And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of ultimate teams. We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement, which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis, we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working for home, but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement, a lot of player movement, and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. And just some little detail I would add in there. Again, when we think about Ultimate Team, it's a long-term balanced way to connect your friends in and around the sport. And it has become that and it's certainly the most played mode in FIFA and very strong in lot of franchises. As we think about this, 2/3 of people who play Ultimate Team don't actually buy packs and only 9 out of 10 packs are opened with earned coins. And so we're always trying to ensure that constant balance of engagement and enjoyment of our player community. And what we saw with premium packs was we saw a higher incidence of new players coming in Ultimate Team and we saw high conversion of those new players in and around buying packs and participating in the digital ecosystem. So again, long term, we think that, that model will continue to grow. We think that is a means of connection to your friends and connections to the sport you love and continue to grow. And our teams are going to continue to look for interesting and new and innovative and creative ways that allow people to really more deeply engage, and premium packs is one of those examples.\nBlake Jorgensen: Chris, we got time for one more question? Or is that it?\nChris Evenden: No, I think that's it. So if you just want to close the call now or at time put me out.\nBlake Jorgensen: Well, thank you everybody for your interest and good questions, and we look forward to interacting with you over the next couple of months. And hopefully, we all get to see each other in person one of these days soon. So - but I appreciate it.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you all. Stay well.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Blake Jorgensen",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. We delivered a big beat this quarter, primarily driven by outperformance from 2 high-quality new games, our Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and It Takes Two, the second title from our partnership with Hazelight Studios. It Takes Two launched at the very end of the prior quarter and showed considerable strength through Q1. Live services also performed better than expected, led by continued growth in Apex Legends. As a result, we delivered net revenue of $1.55 billion and net bookings of $1.34 billion. Given the extraordinary engagement driven by the blockbuster - by the lockdown a year ago and the fact that last year's quarter had 14 weeks compared to this year's 13, to deliver results within 5% of last year's record sales is an incredible testament to the strength of our game teams and our ability to deliver games and extra content from our ongoing live services. The extra week last year Q1 alone is worth more than the year-on-year difference. Notably, even against the unique circumstances of a year ago, Apex Legends grew strongly in the quarter and remains on track to grow organically more than 20% this year with the mobile launch as an upside. Because of the impact of the pandemic on year-on-year over comparisons, it's helpful to compare this quarter with the pre-COVID Q1 fiscal 2020 to better understand underlying growth. On that basis, FIFA Ultimate Team is up 47%; Madden Ultimate Team, up 115%; equivalent to CAGRs of 21% and 47%, respectively. Similarly, sales, including Codemasters from our broad portfolio of catalog titles are up 55%, a CAGR of 25%. Mobile, excluding our Glu acquisition, is also up 16% organically over the same period 2 years ago. We have also made considerable progress on our strategic goals as we started to integrate Codemasters, completed the acquisitions of Gul Mobile and Metalhead and announced our agreement to acquire Playdemic. These acquisitions substantially increase our sports and mobile footprint and offer the opportunity to bring new sports to formats pioneered by MLB Tap Sports Baseball, Super Mega Baseball, and Golf Clash. We only launched F1 2021 a few weeks ago, but we're already seeing sell-through up more than 20% over last year's addition, thanks to another great game from the Codemasters team leveraged by our global commercial operation. We have created a historically strong strategic position for the company with a strong and growing core of live service supplemented by additional growth opportunities in sports opened up by the acquisition plus blockbuster releases, as demonstrated by the community reaction to our upcoming Battlefield 2042. Digital represents 58% of our full game units sold through on a trailing 12-month basis, up 6 percentage points from last year. Operating expenses, which include recent M&A costs, came in slightly below our expectations. Now turning to guidance. We now expect fiscal 2022 GAAP revenue to be $6.85 billion, cost of revenue to be $1.921 billion and earnings per share of $1.58, up from $1.34. Our guidance does not include any estimate for Playdemic given that, that acquisition has not yet closed. And remember, this EPS calculation does not factor in future buybacks under our 2-year $2.6 billion share repurchase program. We're raising our net booking guidance for the year by $100 million to $7.4 billion based on performance from full game sales this quarter, supported by ongoing confidence in our live services. It's very rare that we raise guidance this early in the year. And I would note that despite the clear strength of player interest so far, it is too soon to raise our unit expectations for Battlefield 2042. As a result, the stronger product mix we are now anticipating for this year, we are raising our expectations for underlying, profit and more specifics are in the downloadable model that we post on our website. Underlying the strength of our strategic position, I would briefly note that even with the strength we expect for fiscal 2022, we expect growth in the mid- to high single digits in fiscal 2023. We've also raised our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to $1.85 billion, with capital expenditures remaining around $250 million. That would deliver free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.775 billion, cost of revenue to be $518 million and operating expenses of $1.030 billion. This results in an earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter. We expect Q2 fiscal 2012 net bookings to be $1.725 billion, which would make it our largest Q2 ever, driven by the launch of FIFA, continued growth of Apex Legends plus Mobile, F1, Madden and The Sims. This is up 90% on a year ago quarter. With another great quarter under our belts, we're looking forward to the launches of our sports titles this quarter and Battlefield 2042 in time for the holidays. Our strategic position has never been stronger, with growth drivers in place for this year, next year and beyond. I'd like to announce one thing, and that is our Chief Accounting Officer, Ken Barker, has decided to retire from EA. Many of you know Ken. He's interacted with investors and the buy-side and sell-side for years. Ken has done an amazing job as a Chief Accounting Officer over the last 18 years as well as supporting 3 CEOs and the management team during his time at the company. In addition, he has been a fantastic business partner for me over the last 9 years. He has developed an amazing team of people that support our business and exceptional leaders that will be able to carry on his strong support of the company. Ken's groomed a very strong person to take over the Chief Accounting Officer role, Eric Kelly, who I think many of you also know. Eric also has been with EA for 18 years in all of our key markets around the world, Europe, Asia and North America. And he has all the skills and strengths to fill the very large shoes that Ken has worn for years. We're lucky that Ken has agreed to assist in the transition over the next 9 months. So he'd be with us until after we close our fiscal year. And I thank Ken for an amazing commitment to EA and his fantastic partnership. So with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew. We lost, Andrew? Sorry. I was on mute. Sorry about that. So what I was saying is, first and foremost, focus on the acquisitions that we've done. And those, on their own, will create substantial uptick in both top line growth and bottom line growth as we look at continuing to fuel those acquisitions and then use those talent bases to start to build out new titles that we can add to our overall portfolio. Second, think about Apex Mobile. We've said that we have very little in this year. We're in test market, and we should be out in the global markets in China next year, if not earlier. That could be a huge driver in profitability going forward. We have the potential of live services around Battlefield as well as a Battlefield mobile game coming up. And we clearly have other games planned, such as a Need for Speed or others that are coming, which you'll hear more about in the future. But you can imagine. We try to operate the business on a 5-year cadence if not longer, and we're thinking about how do we generate growth each year, both organic and through acquisitions. And I would tell you I think we are in a better position than we've ever seen before. Yes. So I know not everyone on the street has seen this, and it's not clear for a lot of people. We'll ship FIFA on technically October 1, which means we actually ship it a little earlier for people who are part of our subscription program, for example. But we will capture some revenue, as we've shown in our guidance for this quarter in Q2. we'll also capture revenue in Q3. And usually, the first 1 to 2 quarters of FIFA are the biggest quarters because people are building their ultimate teams. And so we'll see strong growth both this quarter and next quarter off of FIFA with the shift being that it's dropping in Q2, which last year, it only dropped in Q3 when we started it, but it should make a huge difference. And for the full year, obviously, we wouldn't have generated - or said that we were going to grow for a full year and increase our guidance if we weren't confident about FIFA as well as other products. Yes. All good questions. I would say next year - and this is a testament to our business. Next year is a collection of great franchises all coming to play and new franchises. So new franchises in mobile, new franchises across our business, in places like F1 and other driving games and new franchises or existing franchises that we will bring back that - like NCAA or PGA Golf that we've talked about. And you know what? We've always tried to build the business on a collection of great titles, not one title because one title always poses risk. And so our view is a collection of the titles with great live services associated with them - and you're going to see that over the next - not just next year but for the next many years to come. That's how we've tried to build our business. And I think you'll hear more about it. We're not trying to give guidance right now on next year. But we did say in our prepared remarks that we're confident of growth going forward even after an incredible growth there this year and last year. And we feel like we're on a really good path to continue to try to grow this business, and we're seeing the great reception for our products in the marketplace. So more to come on that. We'll give you guys more details as we get closer. We know that's what you want. But you should just trust that we're confident that we're seeing and we're planning both top line and bottom line growth going forward. And now I don't remember your next two questions. Yes. What I would say is that don't take our comments on not updating the guidance on Battlefield in any way as a negative. It is - we ultimately expose the world to Battlefield later than we normally would do. Normally, we do it through early June, E3 or maybe even earlier than that, and we did it in early July. So we're trying to make sure we pace the disclosure about what's in the game to people and then measure our demand off of that. But we're feeling very, very positive about it. And we wouldn't have raised our full year guidance if we didn't feel that was a potential for us, and I think it's an upside for the company longer term during the year. You're going to hear a lot more over the next couple of months about Battlefield live services, in-game monetization and so forth. I can't tell you all that now, but trust that the team is working very hard on this, and they have some very unique ideas about what we can continue to do, what Andrew just said, to create this as a long-term interaction with our consumers versus simply selling a game this year. And we want to build a long-term relationship as we have with Battlefield users for a long time. Portal is a perfect example of how that works, and you'll see more of that and more details about that over the next couple of months. Well, I would say with all of our acquisitions that we've done - we've done 4 now if you include Playdemic, which is not yet closed, you're going to see clearly some synergies, synergies in terms of management teams, synergies in terms of go-to-market strategies, marketing strategies and so forth. Most of these companies are smaller. They are exceptional in how they develop games. But as you've seen with F1 already, we've been able to drive more sales than what we've seen historically with that business, and we'll continue to do that across all of the portfolio of companies. I would say in the case of Playdemic and in the case of Glu, Tap Sports Baseball and Metalhead with their baseball game and Playdemic's golf game, we are going to leverage their strengths as best as possible to try to find ways to create more and better casual games in mobile - on mobile than we have in the past. And that's not to say that we haven't done a good job on mobile. We have, but the potential that we have - if you look at what Playdemic's done, the potential we have with something like a global FIFA game or a global Madden game where we already have the licenses, there is huge upside. I can't give you what those numbers look like yet. But I will tell you that the reason we did these deals was to try to make sure we brought the talent in that could help us expand our capabilities on more casual sports games around the globe and more casual games in general around the globe. And we're pretty excited about it. And I'd tell you, the mobile teams have worked very closely with the new teams at Playdemic or Glu or Metalhead or Codemasters, and they've come up with some amazing ideas on what we could do together. Yes. I would say just on the F1 game, I think we've exceeded our expectations. There's no negative on the F1 team because they are exceptional. it was could we quickly - I mean we didn't own the business for that long. So could we quickly integrate the teams, our marketing and publishing efforts to try and drive that business as fast as we did? That's probably where we might have had some questions. And actually, we've well exceeded that - And it's to the testament of an exceptional game development team that was able to produce the right assets, to produce the right marketing materials to help us drive this business and the teams working together. And you know what? I think we don't get enough credit for that. But EA is a bunch of people who really can work well together. And we do a great job of working with other parts of our company. And when we bring in acquisitions, we work well with them. And I think the poster child there is you look at Respawn and you look at what's happened with Apex. This is a team effort. And Respawn as obviously driven the amazing development of Apex, but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now - it's coming up to almost $2 billion in business over 2 years. That's unheard of in our industry. And I'm not sure we get enough credit for it. I don't really care. But at the end of the day, it is amazing what our teams are able to do. I would tell you, to your earlier part of the question, we've tried to put together great marketing for all of the companies that we've acquired, and it doesn't - it happens quick. And F1 has been a great example of that, and you have to have great products to do that. And so I would tell you that the combination of great teams and great marketers is really powerful in this industry, and I think we've been able to prove that we can do that across all the acquisitions that we've done in the last 4 or 5 years. Yes. And what I would say on the advertising side is right or wrong, we've never had a large advertising business. It covers around $100 million a year. Part of that is our strategy that we have not wanted people to leave our network. And if you look at most advertising on mobile, it's for other mobile games. And what that means is you're willing to allow people to leave your network to go play somewhere else. We're working with Glu right now and with Playdemic on their views on advertising, and we may change our views over time. We think it's important - in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it, but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road if that's where we want to go. And more to come on that. We're just - we're still in the learning stage relative to how we managed advertising in the past. We know the current rules, new rules make it even more challenging. And so we're trying to figure out what are the right ways to do advertising for you to play a world where people are willing to pay via an advertising app or an advertising video or whatever it is versus pay to play the game. And we'll see how that plays out over time. So no cost synergies are included in our guidance. Clearly, revenue synergies are occurring as they occur. As you pointed out, we did better at F1 than we thought we would. Those are harder to predict. But we haven't yet implanted cost synergies in our OpEx line. For example, changes in executives, changes in staffing, changes - either positive or negative. You should assume that there are going to be some changes, and we will layer those into guidance over the next 3 to 6 months. We've been very focused on making sure we're bringing the company in as successful as possible and then determining what is the right way to drive synergies. But I would tell you is - there are potential large synergies across all of the acquisitions we've made, which would normally happen, but we'll see more of those over the next few quarters, and we'll try to keep everyone appraised of that. Well, I'll pull Andrew to answer that, but I hope we actually get to real people in the stands because we might go the other way right now. So who knows? Yes. I would say that we always have newer players come in as the game grows. Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1, one, because they got to understand how to play it; two, they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens, we start to see growth. And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of ultimate teams. We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement, which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis, we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working for home, but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement, a lot of player movement, and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team. Chris, we got time for one more question? Or is that it? Well, thank you everybody for your interest and good questions, and we look forward to interacting with you over the next couple of months. And hopefully, we all get to see each other in person one of these days soon. So - but I appreciate it."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I hope all of you are continuing to stay healthy. I want to start out today by thanking all of our amazing teams across Electronic Arts, who continue to create and deliver so many great experiences for our players during this unprecedented period. It's been an exciting few months since our last call. We've unveiled Battlefield 2042. We've launched F1 2021. We've showed what is coming with our next Madden NFL and FIFA titles. We had a fantastic EAPlay-live event with great fan response, and we've announced the acquisition of Playdemic, which is another step in our strategy of continued leadership in sports and growing in mobile. Integration efforts with the teams at Codemasters, Blue Mobile and Metalhead are going well, and we're pleased to be building a lot of anticipation through the summer for our upcoming games and content. Looking at our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered very strong results. Even as the world took steps towards opening back up, we deepened engagement and connections for players in and around our games. And we see this trend going well into the future. Our talented teams are delivering experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play, and our new launches, leading games and life services all performed very well during the quarter. Execution against our long-term strategy continues to power growth in our business. Revenue, net bookings and EPS were all above our guidance for Q1. We are raising our full year net revenue, net bookings and EPS guidance today, and we are also forecasting our biggest second quarter ever. Our long-term strategy is focused on 4 key opportunities: the continued creation of great games and content with a focus on mobile, tools for the community to drive deeper engagement with our content, the aggregation and distribution of content and services to more platforms, business models and geographies, and harnessing the power of the social ecosystems in and around our games. As part of this, in FY '22, we continue to execute against 3 key growth drivers: building on our leadership in sports; growing our blockbuster franchises; and expanding live services across our portfolio, including mobile. EA SPORTS continues to extend its leadership position through the global strength of our franchises and growing portfolio. More than 140 million players have engaged with our EA SPORTS games over the last 12 months. At the center of this, our FIFA franchise is growing around the world. Over 31 million players have joined FIFA 21 on console and PC since launch, and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to engage more soccer fans, which FUT matches up 48% year-over-year in Q1. In China, FIFA Online 4 set all-time records for monthly, weekly and peak daily active players, driving new records for our business there. On a global basis, FIFA is growing as part of the social fabric of soccer, and we are connecting players through our games and live services on more platforms and more geographies than ever. We've also launched F1 2021, the first F1 experience to be part of our EA SPORTS portfolio in nearly 20 years. With an incredibly high-quality game that has won praise from fans and critics, F1 2021 is bringing fans into the excitement of the sport during one of the most memorable seasons in recent history. Sales were up significantly year-over-year, and total active players have grown by nearly 10% since launch over last year's game, demonstrating the power that comes from the amazing team at Codemasters, a great game, and our EA distribution and marketing strength. Momentum continues to build for F1, which like soccer is one of the few truly global sports, and we see a major opportunity to continue growing the franchise to reach a larger audience of players and viewers. Later this summer, we will begin launching our strong next-gen slate for EA SPORTS, that includes Madden NFL 22 with new experiences in franchise mode and The Yard; FIFA 22, which is already showing very strong demand metrics as our new hyper motion technology powered innovation throughout the game; NHL coming to next-gen consoles for the first time; an EA SPORTS PGA Tour, the only game where you can exclusively play all 4 of golf's major tournaments, the Masters at Augusta National, the Open Championship, the U.S. Open Championship and the PGA Championship. We're also thrilled to be back in the baseball business with Super Mega baseball and MLB Tap Sports on mobile, and we look forward to sharing more from those teams in the future. With the strength of our industry-leading EA SPORTS teams, the addition of talent and expertise from Glu, Codemasters, Metalhead and soon Playdemic as well as partnerships with international developers, we have exciting plans to create more EA SPORTS experiences for fans around the world to play, watch and connect. Our second growth driver is building blockbuster entertainment properties around our IP. This year, this is led by Apex Legends and Battlefield, 2 of the leading franchises in their category. Apex Legends continues to accelerate as one of the top titles in the industry. During Season 9, we've averaged more than 13 million weekly active players. We've set a new record for peak daily players across all seasons, and the 3 latest in-game events have driven the highest play accounts for events to date. In every season and event, the Respawn team is constantly innovating, trying new things and gathering feedback to evolve the live service. And as a result, player engagement and investment continues to grow. Respawn is now expanding the game beyond battle royale with new experiences like arenas, which has brought new and lapsed players into the game and opens the door for deeper esports opportunities. With so much excitement in the community for the future of Apex Legends, we see outstanding growth ahead for this powerful global franchise. During Q1, we revealed Battlefield 2042, and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible. Since the reveal on June 9, our Battlefield trailers and content have cumulative generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels. These record leadership levels contributed to Battlefield 2042 being the most talked about title in the industry during a busy month of June and created a record high sentiment among the Battlefield fan community. More recently, we introduced Battlefield Portal, a new community-driven experience in Battlefield 2042. This new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in Battlefield, easily mixing and matching ears, maps, weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community. It's an entirely new level of freedom in Battlefield, and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create, discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected. We are poised to deliver a truly next-gen Battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation, massive scale and amazing gameplay, and we have more to share about the game through the summer. There is enduring power to the franchisees and IP that we are building. The launch of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, the remaster of the first 3 Mass Effect games, reignited the passion of fans around the world, driving sales performance well above our expectations. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order coming to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 was also a moment for new and returning players to jump into that amazing game. We're continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing IP. Our third growth driver is live services, our core strength and continuing growth opportunity for us, and mobile is now a significant part of this. With the addition of Glu, our portfolio now spans more than 15 top mobile live services and we will add the top sports mobile title in the industry with Golf Clash when Playdemic joins EA. The breadth and diversity of our mobile live services now spans multiple major genres, including casual, sports, RPG lifestyle and racing. Over the past year, we've expanded our mobile-native talent. And with their leadership, we are now growing these titles to reach new and broad audiences on a global scale. We're also delivering our blockbuster franchises to mobile players, including Apex Legends and Battlefield experiences rolling out for mobile later this year. With the ability to bring new teams together with EA's powerful IP, we are building mobile into a growth center for Electronic Arts with long-running live services at the core of our strategy. Underpinning these growth drivers are the fact that games, and particularly our portfolio experiences at Electronic Arts, are creating social connection for more and more people around the world. More than 0.5 billion players are coming together through the social networks formed in and around our games, and we see this continuing to grow. With some of the most talented teams in the industry, a deep pipeline of innovative experience in established and new IP, new content partnerships and more ways to connect and experience play, we are positioning our business for continued growth and leadership this year and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Blake. Sorry. Minor glitch. Thank you, Blake. I'd like to echo your thoughts and sentiments and say thank you, Ken, for all of your outstanding contributions to Electronic Arts. We'll miss you. As I started this call, I again want to thank our teams for everything they continue to do in service of our players around the world. Thanks to their efforts, we're bringing hundreds of millions of players together through our games and live services like Apex Legends. We're delivering great new experiences like F1 2021 and Mass Effect Legendary Edition, and we have even more amazing content to come. It's been a strong start to our fiscal year. Our growth drivers, leadership in sports, building blockbuster franchises and growing live services, including mobile, are accelerating our business, and we're well positioned for continued growth this year and beyond. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Yes. I would tell you, I just think that when you think about how we go to market with our games, we have global reach. We have extraordinarily digital capabilities and kind of data-driven marketing processes that allows us to better target both existing players, lapsed players and potential new players. And I think what we've been able to do as an organization is take that strength, partner that with an extraordinary game team at Codemasters and what is also a spectacular game in the middle of an F1 season that is more interesting than any season in recent history with the competition between Hamilton and Verstappen kind of hotting up. And the combination of all those things together has meant that we've seen growth in the franchise and expect to continue to grow that franchise over time. It would - this game is early in the partnership between Codemasters and EA SPORTS. So a lot of how we think about the future live service of that business and sustaining that community and that fan base and play base over time is going to continue to evolve. There is some this year but not as extensive as certainly we think we will get to over the course of time. Two great questions. Having just provided a very small trailer on Dead Space, there's - or a sweet preview on Dead Space, there's no lot more I can share about that. It's a little ways out yet, but the studio has taken it on. What I can say is it's one of the great games from our catalog there has been extraordinary demand to bring it back for existing players and next generation of players, and we're excited to kind of add that to the portfolio over time. And we'll be able to share more as development continues. But I would just - I would close on that point by saying it was one of the most demanded titles for us, maybe just after Skate, which we've also announced we're bringing back, and the response was very positive to the announcement that we're back in development. Around name image and likeness, again, we believe that we can build an extraordinary college football game in the absence of naming and lightness in partnership with the schools and in partnership with the conferences, and we're looking to do that. I also believe with what we have seen most recently in and around an image likeness that is very plausible and likely very possible for us to integrate name image and lightness with athletes according to whatever rule sets may emerge as to how they may engage with us in that context. And we are building the architecture of the game with a database structure so that if and when that comes online, we'll be able to add back to the game very seamlessly. Yes, two great questions. On preview packs, the short answer is it was very well received by the community. Our FIFA Ultimate team are always working very closely with our community of players. FIFA Ultimate Team is the most played mode in that game by a wide margin. And we're always working to offer new and innovative and creative ways to engage, connect with your friends, connect with the world of football and build your ultimate team. Premium pack, as I said, was well received. We saw an increase in engagement, and we saw a higher rate of conversion of spenders. I would say it was coming down towards the end of the season. So some of this data has to be taken in that context. But the team is committed to continue to innovate in and around the offers and the programs that we put together for our players and believe that we can continue to grow that business over time. With respect to Pro Evolution Soccer change names football and going through to play, we've seen this happen before. I would tell you we're very committed to our soccer business. We're very committed to our player base. We continue to grow that player base. We've listened to our community over the years, and we've gone out and got much of the license content that underpins an authentic football game exclusively and continue to invest deeply not just in modes of play but in core gameplay to ensure that we're delivering the best possible experience for our global player base. And what you heard me talk about in the prepared remarks is as a result of the innovation in and around hypermotion, we're seeing extremely strong demand for the upcoming version of FIFA, and engagement in that franchise continues to grow. So again, competition is always good. We're always very closely cognizant of what competition is doing. But our commitment is to our player base and delivering the most comprehensive, broad-based, authentic football game on the planet. And we believe we have the best team to do that, and we'll look to continue to do that over time. Let me jump in. On do we think Battlefield will return to an every other year launch, I would say - I think that is our orientation. But more importantly, I think you should think about Battlefield as a service what we announced - what we're doing for the launch of this game is really revolutionizing and reinventing what - all our epic scale warfare is in the context of gameplay. In addition to that, we've heard us announce Battlefield Portal, which really starts to lean into user-generated content and will drive deep long-term engagement in the game. And while we've announced Hazard Zone is a name we have to disclose a lot about what's going on there, and you'll hear more about that in the coming months, you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around Battlefield is, which over time will include a mobile launch, will include some free to anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch. So that while - and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today. We're really focused on 365-day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on. Then I think your - the other part of your question was naming lightness college sports and does that open up an opportunity on basketball. I would tell you our focus right now is football. But what you've also heard us talk about is really building on our strength in sports. We believe this is a unique strength for us. We're the leading company when it comes to delivering multiple high-quality sports across - at global scale, and it would not be a match for us in a world where we start to develop more into college football to start expand that to other college sports as well. Yes. And I would jump in. On your point around restrictions and are we seeing anything different, I would tell you given the rollercoaster nature of opening up and shutting down and lockdowns and various restrictions that are happening in various geographies and territories globally, it's almost hard to track at this juncture who is open and who is closed. What I would tell you though in aggregate is we have seen strength across our business, across all territories regardless of being open or closed. I think the performance this quarter is a testament to that. And at some level, this is largely due to what we see in our games is it's not just about a connection to content that people may be able to forgo in the context of returning to school or returning to work or returning to kind of general life. It's about connections to friends that they had prior to playing and they made during playing that people keep coming back to. And as we think about building ongoing interactive entertainment experiences, this is why you hear us leading into the social ecosystems in and around our games because this is what drives longevity and it's what drives deepening engagement in our business. And so I think what we're seeing right now is the world is in different phases in different places. But on aggregate, engagement in and around our games continues to be extremely strong. Let me jump in on Apex and then maybe Blake could hit the kind of the mobile ad piece. The only thing I would tell you is it's not just any one thing. I think what I talked about in my prepared remarks is the very detailed nature that the Respawn team and the Apex team takes the ongoing development of this experience and the support of the growing global communities. And it's really about - on any given day, it's really thinking about what enhancement, extensions, innovations they can add to core gameplay, that moment-to-moment gameplay. There is - how can they think about new modalities of play like arenas, which changes kind of the broader rule set of how you engage in that moment to moment gameplay. And how do they add content with the legend and with all of those - the extra stuff in and around that, that drives more interest. And I think what we're seeing now is that team really started to deeply understand using data and using a close relationship they have with the community, continue to enhance gameplay, continue to add modalities of play and continue to double down on a really interesting, unique content that the community really gravitates towards. And I think as you think about that in the context, we're now taking that new geographies and new platforms. This is why we're so confident in the ongoing strength of that franchise. Yes. The one thing I would add there is while it hasn't been a giant business for us, what we have seen as Glu has kind of joined us is they actually have been significantly better at monetizing through advertising than we have been. They come with some really strong underlying technology. They come with really strong underlying expertise. And our sense is while it's still early, our sense is the combination of that technology, that expertise, our broader base of portfolio and the global reach it has likely means there's upside opportunity for us even in today's world. That was going to be my point. It's hard to understand exactly where the world is going to go. I think it's unlikely that we have events without fans in the stadiums, and we may just see some protocols around masks and/or testing and/or vaccination. But our whole sports fans is that we get fans back in stadiums. I think what you saw us do last year was really leading to the fact that for many people, we were sport at a time where it's really hard to engage or consume support more broadly. That did, in fact, allow us to grow both the amount of people playing our games and the engagement they had. I don't know that we can quantify what that means when everyone really gets to live the forms of sports on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, season-to-season basis, but it will inevitably have a positive uplift to just overall fan and player sentiment and will almost certainly drive deeper engagement in our games. And our teams will look to build stronger connection between what has happened in the real world of sport and what is happening in our games. So net-net, notwithstanding any further challenges around the pandemic, it's almost certainly a positive for us. Yes. And just some little detail I would add in there. Again, when we think about Ultimate Team, it's a long-term balanced way to connect your friends in and around the sport. And it has become that and it's certainly the most played mode in FIFA and very strong in lot of franchises. As we think about this, 2/3 of people who play Ultimate Team don't actually buy packs and only 9 out of 10 packs are opened with earned coins. And so we're always trying to ensure that constant balance of engagement and enjoyment of our player community. And what we saw with premium packs was we saw a higher incidence of new players coming in Ultimate Team and we saw high conversion of those new players in and around buying packs and participating in the digital ecosystem. So again, long term, we think that, that model will continue to grow. We think that is a means of connection to your friends and connections to the sport you love and continue to grow. And our teams are going to continue to look for interesting and new and innovative and creative ways that allow people to really more deeply engage, and premium packs is one of those examples. Thank you all. Stay well."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-end 2023 Conference Call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Stuart Canfield, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nStuart Canfield: Thank you. Welcome to EA's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-end 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Chris Suh, our CFO; and Laura Miele, our COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we'll post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.  With regards to our calendar, our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, August 1. As a reminder, we post a schedule of upcoming earnings calls for the fiscal year on our IR website.  This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, May 9, 2023, and disclaims any duty to update them.  During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated.  Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Stuart. I hope all of you are well. I want to start by sharing how inspired and proud I am of our teams. Against macro uncertainty and constant change, we navigated the year with resilience and determination. Throughout fiscal year 2023, we showed the strength of our business, delivered for our players and lived up to the promise of our values. To every EA employee, thank you.  Over the fiscal year, we executed across our business, delivering high-quality games, launching 7 new releases and providing over 450 content updates across 51 titles. Consumer appetite for interactive entertainment experiences is at an all-time high. And with our player network expanding to nearly 700 million, we delivered record engagement across some of our biggest franchises.  EA is leading the future of interactive entertainment in a dynamic industry where new audiences, new technology and new media trends are reshaping the world around us. Consumption of sports and entertainment is accelerating, and media trends are evolving. We see these transformations as immense opportunities to do more amazing things for our people and our players.  As we look to the future, we're focused on delivering against 3 key strategies: building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities, creating blockbuster interactive storytelling and amplifying the power of community in and around our games with social and creative tools. Executing these strategies across the modalities of play, watch, create and connect will lay the foundation for long-term growth as we write the next great chapter of EA story.  Fiscal year 2023 was an amazing year for EA SPORTS FIFA with the entire ecosystem producing incredible results. Console, mobile and PC both premium and free-to-play, delivered double-digit growth in net bookings, and FIFA 23 became the best-selling title in franchise history. Our interactive experiences are at the heart of global football culture and fandom and are a testament to a strategy sharpened by 30 years of passion, creativity and innovation.  Fiscal year 2024 stands to be another important year for EA SPORTS. We will build on the massive momentum in our global football ecosystem, delivering expanded enhanced experience for fans, EA SPORTS FC. In April, we unveiled the brand identity and vision for EA SPORTS FC. By every measure, this was the biggest brand moment ever created at EA, reaching billions of potential players generating thousands of media hits within days and inspiring record positive sentiment amongst our players with the support of hundreds of partners, athletes, leagues, federations and clubs. With EA SPORTS FC, we are building a fan-first future for global football, and we cannot wait to share more in July.  Already, the world's permanent American football experience, Madden NFL delivered an extraordinary amount of content in and around the game in fiscal year 2023, driving deep engagement and becoming the best-selling title in this franchise's history on console and PC. Madden NFL 24 will build on this excitement, offering even more fun and immersive game play.  Our fourth quarter saw a resurgence in Apex Legends performance. Season 16 powered by massive game enhancements like a new class system transformed the way core Legends played. Our strong community of players responded favorably, lifting peak engagement more than 20% from the previous season. The resilience of Apex Legends reinforces its unique position as an IP with a power to consistently entertain players as they play, watch and compete in an evolving world. Throughout fiscal year 2023, Apex entertained an average of 20 million monthly active users. This player loyalty is fueled by responsibility to continuously expand and improve the player experience.  No other game in the industry celebrates creativity and individuality quite like The Sims. This diverse and passionate community has fueled imagination and champion self-expression since its launch in 2014, growing to over 70 million players worldwide and counting. Our talented team at Maxis Studios is using the power of creation and connection to shape culture, developing new experiences for The Sims 4 to take entertainment to unimaginable heights.  To continually inspire the world to play, we are focused on blockbuster storytelling. Our history and leadership of bringing together culture-defining IP with interactive entertainment creates incredible opportunities to build an unrivaled portfolio bolstered by powerful collaborations. These are fundamental ways to bring more players into our global network through the lasting power that only blockbusters can deliver.  Just 11 days ago, we delivered on this priority with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. This incredible game has received widespread positive reviews earned an 86 Metacritic score on console and has been called a Game of the Year contender by multiple press outlets. Our dev teams are working with the community around some high-end PC specs. And beyond this, it has been a strong launch. Within the first few weeks, millions of players have joined Cal Kestis and BD-1 in a rebellion against the empire. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is storytelling at its finest, which is central to the game's success and to our creative collaboration with The Walt Disney Company and Lucasfilm. The game is pure blockbuster entertainment and fans have embraced the story of our Jedi games as a central part of the Star Wars saga, demonstrating how great interactive entertainment can grow and deepen the fandom of an incredibly powerful IP universe.  Games are the social networks of the future. To amplify the power of community, we are innovating across a set of social and creative tools in and around our games. Our strategy is to help players make new friends, build their social network and create community. These in-game social experiences were rolled out in FIFA 23. Among players that are interacting with a new feature set, engagement increased over 150%. Our data shows these innovations are driving results in our business and confirm what we know to be true: having more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting.  As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio. With a strong close to fiscal year 2023, we are executing on our core strategies, and our focused investments are positioned to drive results across our content and services pipeline. We remain committed to capturing our biggest opportunities and delivering long-term value in our business by doing more amazing things for our players and communities.  Now I hand the call over to Chris to provide additional details on our business.\nChristopher Suh: Thanks, Andrew. And hello, everyone. Our fiscal year 2023 results again demonstrated the fundamental strength of our portfolio, the resiliency of our live services business model and our ability to execute in a disciplined manner. We again outgrew an uneven market, took decisive actions to sharpen our focus and finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter performance.  Our fiscal year was highlighted by significant milestones across our portfolio. In the 6 months since launch, EA SPORTS FIFA 23 has surpassed lifetime sales of EA SPORTS FIFA 22. Apex Legends continued to engage players around the world and following our decision to make the base game free to enter in October, The Sims hit historic engagement highs with tens of millions of new players in the community.  Throughout the year, we continue to take deliberate actions to focus our company and align our business more closely with the strategic priorities that Andrew outlined, culminating with the actions we announced in late March to rationalize our games portfolio and optimize our real estate footprint. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a charge of $155 million, with the remaining charges to be recognized during the first half of fiscal 2024.  For the fourth quarter, net bookings were $1.9 billion, up 11% or 15% in constant currency. Our results exceeded our expectations and reached a new fourth quarter high, driven by a record live services performance and strength in full game. EA SPORTS FIFA significantly outperformed as net bookings grew 31% year-over-year or up 37% in constant currency. Apex Legends also delivered a stronger quarter than anticipated as players returned for Season 16 in our fourth anniversary collection event.  Our live services net bookings were $1.6 billion, up 9% or 13% in constant currency, significantly outperforming our expectations as EA SPORTS FIFA live services delivered a record quarter. FIFA Ultimate Team net bookings grew 20% year-over-year or up 26% in constant currency and saw all-time high engagement. FIFA Online 4 was up 62% or 71% in constant currency, and FIFA Mobile grew triple digits year-over-year and reached its first $100 million net bookings quarter. Apex Legends saw improved performance following a competitive third quarter, rebounding to a low single-digit year-over-year growth quarter in constant currency. And The Sims 4 exceeded expectations as a new expansion pack and free base game updates resonated with the growing community.  Our mobile business, excluding the strong FIFA mobile results, stabilized and delivered in line with our expectations. Our strategy is focused on enhancing player experiences by connecting our largest brands across platforms, delivering blockbuster mobile experiences and optimizing our portfolio for profitable long-term growth. We delivered fourth quarter net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Operating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases. These increases were partially offset by prudent management of other variable spend.  Now let me talk about our full year performance. Our net bookings were $7.3 billion, down 2% or up 1% in constant currency, outperforming uneven market conditions and industry headwinds in mobile. Our net revenue was $7.4 billion for the year, and diluted EPS was $2.88. We generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders.  Now let me turn to the outlook. Our fiscal year 2024 outlook reflects many of the trends we saw in fiscal year 2023. We expect engagement across the portfolio to remain very healthy and our highly reoccurring live services business to show great resilience again. We continue to operate in a competitive market with changing macro conditions. And as such, we will continue to be focused, deliberate and disciplined as we execute against our strategic priorities.  For FX, if rates remain unchanged, we expect a headwind of nearly 2 points for net bookings and 6 points for underlying profit growth, net of hedges relative to last year. We expect fiscal 2024 net bookings to be $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5% year-over-year or up 1% to 7% in constant currency, built on a strong foundation of our evergreen live services, growth in our massive online communities, the introduction of EA SPORTS FC and blockbuster story point through Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.  We expect EA SPORTS FC to deliver low single-digit net bookings growth, building on its momentum growing again on top of a record fiscal year 2023. We expect cost of revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting gross margin expansion, driven by a mix of revenue across royalty-bearing licenses, platform and digital. We expect operating expenses to be $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion with continued focused investments in our business to drive long-term growth. As a result, we expect underlying profitability to grow faster than net bookings.  We expect operating cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and capital expenditures of around $275 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. The business continues to be a strong generator of cash. We expect to continue to repurchase stock under our current authorization, which expires in November 2024. We expect fiscal 2024 net revenue to be $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.81.  Now moving to our outlook for the first quarter. We anticipate net bookings for Q1 to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, up 15% to 23% or up 19% to 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by full game sales of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. For the first quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, cost of revenue to be $350 million to $370 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.14.  Our business is in a strong position propelled by strong brands, massive online communities, blockbuster storytelling and evergreen live services. Our efforts over the last year to align our teams more closely with our key priorities has led to a more focused scope of work, which will help us deliver on our multiyear growth aspirations.  Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. Interactive entertainment is at an inflection point. The industry is expanding, the number of players expect to grow significantly over the coming years. The audience is becoming more diverse with cultural and generational trends accelerating content consumption. Engaging this expanding player base means reaching them on devices everywhere through disruptive technologies.  For EA, these transformations represent opportunities to grow today and over the long term. We have the best talent in the industry to execute against our long-term strategy. It's through their passion and creativity that we will continue to deliver on our mission to inspire the world to play. We are focused on bringing more amazing games to more people around the world, inspiring them to build community, celebrate shared fandom and have joyful experiences. The future of entertainment is interactive, and no team is better equipped to lead this transformation than EA.  Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: I've got one kind of on June and then kind of a big picture question. Chris, could you help me reconcile a little bit the June guidance? I think a year ago, you had one title. In the June quarter, you have 5 this time. And then clearly, there's some strong momentum in live services. So is this cautious guide? Is this -- is there something in the live service momentum that slows down? Just a little bit more color you can give on June would be great.\nChristopher Suh: Andrew, so you're talking about the -- our guide for Q1?\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Q1, yes. Yes, sir.\nChristopher Suh: Yes. Right. So specifically, our guide in Q1 is driven really by the performance of our live services business. And as you pointed out, we have some year-over-year things on new launches that are driving that performance.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: It seems like 5 games should drive more than a couple of hundred million dollars, right, if I'm doing my math right? Or is it just in -- go ahead.\nChristopher Suh: No, sorry. And we're happy to sort of take you through sort of line by line on that. But it is relative to the size of the launches, I think, that you're referring.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Okay. That's great. Yes. And then just kind of big picture, some of the trends that I think you saw in the previous quarters around kind of weakness in smaller titles, I think you guys or some of your peers called out this idea that gamers are kind of coalescing around the biggest titles. Are you still seeing that? And then secondarily, and maybe more importantly, how has that impacted where and how you invest in future titles?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. I think it's a great question. As we look at the marketplace and as we look at consumer trends, I think there's 2 things happening right now. One, which -- and both kind of end us in the same place. But I think one is more short term, and one has as much longer term -- more longer-term ramifications.  The first is that any time through the history of our industry, that there is any kind of consumer softness or consumer trepidation around spending also macroeconomic uncertainty. What we typically see is consumers move towards the biggest brands and the biggest titles and the most recognizable experiences. And that really comes down to kind of general consumer behavior, which is they have less money that they're willing to risk against new things or smaller things or unknown things. And typically, our brands like FIFA, like Madden, like The Sims have performed very well at these times.  That, however, is a moment in time. And our expectation is that as we move through this particular phase and as consumer spending continues to strengthen over time, that there will be opportunities for new titles and new brands. What -- but what we don't think that will outweigh is this movement to these broader social ecosystems that are games, games as platforms. At the very call, we are a games company, but what we are seeing is the evolution of the definition of a game.  And you hear us talk about play, watch, create, connect. And it's really that last piece, that connection piece, that is driving the future of our business. And as we think about building FC for the future, as we think about building The Sims for the future and Battlefield and Apex and Skate and other properties in our portfolio, we really think about that in the context of building games as a platform or content as a platform to drive these long-term businesses across play, watch, create, connect. We think this will be longer-lasting than the present kind of macroeconomic climate. And certainly, that's where we're investing in meaningful parts of our time, money and resources over the coming years.  That's not to take away from the opportunity to launch incredible things like Jedi, which we've just done, which tell unbelievable stories in an interactive world and become a meaningful part of a bigger brand IP like we have with Star Wars. But certainly, as we balance out our investment over time, a great portion of our investment will go into these building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities. We'll then follow up with a more focused, deliberate investment against telling blockbuster interactive stories, and we think that there will be opportunity for investment over time with the extension of these social and credit tools, both for the in-game experience and beyond the game experience broadly. And you'll see us do some more of that, particularly in the world of EA SPORTS in the coming year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank.\nBenjamin Soff: Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expectations for FC. Obviously, you guys had a record year for the franchise, and you're expecting low single-digit growth in the upcoming year. So I just wanted to better understand the drivers there and if you see any challenges or execution risks that you go through the rebrand.\nAndrew Wilson: I'll touch on this broadly, and I'll let Chris kind of talk a little bit more on the details of how we're forecasting and planning. First and foremost, we're coming off an extraordinary year. Football as a sport is growing globally. We think the World Cup did great things for continuing to grow the sport broadly and the fan ecosystem around the sport. I think what we've been able to do with our football franchise is really become central to the fabric of football culture, and the results that you are seeing is really demonstrative of that importance that we play in that fan football culture.  My belief and my belief all along has been that as we move through this rebrand, and certainly as we talked about in the prepared remarks, this rebrand was probably the single biggest rebrand moment in the history of the company and almost certainly the most successful by a fairly wide margin. We've never seen this kind of consumer energy and this kind of positive consumer energy around a launch of this nature, particularly for a business that we've been in for 30 years.  And so I continue to believe that moving through this rebrand actually presents us extraordinary opportunities for growth, and I've talked about this before and the context of what we can do for the player broadly, how we can extend the play, watch, create, connect, experience, how we can extend the relationships that we have with commercial brands that are equally valuable in football fan culture over time. And I think that as we move through this year, and you see what we're doing in the context of the game experience and what's going on around that, we feel very bullish and very confident around growth opportunities of our football business. But we're coming off a pretty big year, and it's a pretty big comp, and so I'll hand off to Chris to kind of talk you through how we're thinking about that.\nChristopher Suh: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Exactly as Andrew said, we're seeing an incredible year for FIFA. We talked about it extensively on the call. Actually, FIFA for the full year across all platforms grew 20% this year in constant currency, and that's off of '22 that also grew double digits. And so the momentum in the business has been fantastic.  As we look forward into the launch of FC, as Andrew said, we're really focused on the player experience and making this a great experience. We're pleased to be able to grow the business again off of 2 consecutive years of double-digit growth.\nBenjamin Soff: Okay. Great. And then just one on the guidance. I think last quarter, you talked about mid-single-digit operating income growth. And if I'm doing my math right, I think the midpoint of your guide implies more of a low single-digit growth rate. So first of all, is that correct? And what changed? And is it FX or maybe something else?\nChristopher Suh: Yes, sure. As we gave the guide at the beginning of Q4, we went through a number of planning assumptions that we shared with you in terms of what we saw in terms of player engagement and quality of games and execution. I would say the biggest difference between now and then is, honestly, the performance that we had in Q4. We had an incredibly strong Q4, exceeding our own expectations on a number of fronts that we talked about in the prepared comments. And as we look forward into '24, our outlook and our planning assumptions for '24 in many cases remain unchanged in the sense that all the things that we focus on, which is quality of games, execution and delivery of our resilient live services, those remain quite stable and consistent and unchanged. And I would say that the comp is just quite a bit higher.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe first one, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Andrew or Chris, just wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit of color -- put a little more meat on the bone, just maybe how that's faring relative to its predecessor and how to think about that title for the balance of the year.  And then just secondly, on mobile, we've got The Lord of the Rings title here in the first quarter. Curious how material you think that can be to the full year. And mobile more broadly, it looks like it's starting to perk up a little bit or stabilize a little bit. Maybe just a little more color on what you're seeing in that market as we head into fiscal '24.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. On the Jedi piece, and I'll let Chris touch on Lord of The Rings, maybe Laura can give you a little bit more color on the launch of that and what we expect. On Jedi, again, we're overjoyed. We made the bold decision to move the title 6 weeks to give the team the opportunity to really get to the quality of games they wanted. And of course, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the quality has been very, very strong, and many are proclaiming is going to be a game of the year contender. And certainly, playing it and speaking to people who are playing it, it represents incredible storytelling in the Star Wars universe. And so I think we're building on where we were with Jedi: Fallen Order. And we're -- and it's certainly been a very strong launch for us. It was very early. I think we're 11 days in at this point. We're in a different kind of market dynamic, but I would tell you it's pacing very strongly against our expectations and against Jedi: Fallen Order.\nChristopher Suh: Great. The only thing I'd add to what Andrew said about Star Wars is that as exactly as we said, we're incredibly excited about the launch. This is a title that we expect to contribute to our financial performance for a very long time. And so we're in early days.  In terms of The Lord of the Rings mobile launch, again, another title we're very pleased at in terms of the quality of the game and the expectations around it. We are being modest and prudent in terms of the underlying implied financial performance within our guide, consistent with what we've talked about in terms of launches of some of our other titles over the last couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson.\nClayton Griffin: I had a question on Apex. I just -- I noted that Overwatch is experimenting with its first kind of IP crossover collaboration, what have you. Correct me if I'm wrong, it has not been a lever that Apex has really pulled. So I'm curious just to get your sense of the pros and cons of maybe going down that road. I don't know if it makes strategically for Apex, but just kind of the broader point is just trying to better understand kind of what you guys want to do with Apex in terms of monetization or engagement as it relates to those types of activities.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I think what you've heard from us, and certainly the performance in Q4 is testament to this, is Apex is one of the strongest franchise in our industry and certainly one of our strongest franchise when we talk about content as a platform, a game experience as a platform, Apex is certainly front and center as we think about our business model. We have a substantial player base with incredible retention. And as is the nature of these free-to-play environment, there are ebbs and flows. And I think what is unique to Apex is its ability to engage and reengage through those ebbs and flows.  We're going to continue to invest in the IP broadly, both geographically from a platform, extending play, extending story. And for what it's worth, I don't think anything is off the table. I think that as we think about game IP today, it's kind of like comic book IP of 20 or 30 years ago. This is the IP that Gen Z and Gen Alpha perhaps identify mostly with, and I think the opportunities for us to continue to grow and expand and stretch the nature of the experiences that we're able to offer to our global player base over the next decade and beyond is unfettered.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Mario. Two, if I can. So is there any color you can provide on your mobile revenue outlook in fiscal '24 that's embedded within the guide? And then separately, for EA SPORTS FC, I appreciate the call-out on the slides that fiscal '24 bookings anticipates low single-digit growth for the title. Are you expecting any margin benefit that will flow down to the bottom line now that the FIFA license has gone?\nChristopher Suh: Let me address your first question. I'll start there and then I sort of missed the first part of your second question, so if you could repeat that here in a second. But in terms of the mobile growth for next year, our expectations are that mobile business in aggregate will be down year-on-year after FY '23, a large part of that related to the decision to sunset the Apex mobile title, and so that obviously is in the comparable for '23. It won't be in the comparable for '24, and that's a big piece of the mobile business revenue performance expectation for '24. And can you go ahead and repeat your second question? I missed the first part of it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, yes. Got it. So are you guys just expecting any sort of margin benefit that will flow down to the bottom line without the FIFA license for EA SPORTS FC?\nChristopher Suh: Got it. Okay. It's FC. I missed the part which game you're referring to. So thank you for that clarification. As we think about the transition to FC, we really are focused on the player experience and making this transition, a great one for our fans around the world. We are going to invest behind that across our brand, rebrand launching as well. And so as you think about the total economics of the business, I would not anticipate it being materially different year-on-year.\nLaura Miele: Mario, I'd just like to add some context -- a little bit more context maybe on how we're thinking about mobile -- our mobile growth and even our future beyond this coming year. I mean clearly, we've all have seen mobile grow in the past decade from $11 billion to $106 billion globally, which is massive and significant. But what we'd like to share is that the industry pursued that growth with the philosophy of user acquisition or development for that matter at any cost. And how we're looking at things now is that, that era is over. The economics didn't make sense, and we were really focused on -- the industry was kind of focused on the wrong things.  How we are looking at it and how we -- what we're prioritizing and our new management kind of a refined approach is around profitable growth. So this means equal attention to top line and bottom line in the market and our business dynamics. It's easy, clearly, to focus on top line and just look at that growth area. But when we look at our business and our new management approach, we have seen mobile profitability across our portfolio in the last 2 to 3 years increase. And specifically, when we look at Glu, we've increased 3x from FY '22 to FY '23 and our profitability. So we're really pleased that under our management and how we're thinking about things that we are still focused on growing the overall business in a profitable way.  Now a couple of things. Andrew mentioned and have outlined incredibly well about this connected ecosystem and our connected communities. Mobile is going to play a meaningful role in that. When we look at our FIFA success, which we've talked a lot about in this call already, but it's just so strong and it's been such a meaningful contributor to the overall ecosystem, players that play FIFA HD and mobile generate a far higher daily average revenue than FIFA players who only play on just one platform. So we know that there's a meaningful contribution that mobile can play in the overall ecosystem.  The second area that we're spending a lot of time in is our existing live services. So we talked about earlier about that we launched The Lord of the Rings game clearly. And that has really modeled after our Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes game, which has generated nearly $1.5 billion over the lifetime. When we look at the market and we evaluate what's working, when you look at the top chart in mobile, the top 10 charts in mobile, only 2 entrants have come in the last 2 years. Everything else has been there for quite a long time.  So we see a pretty significant runway and continued growth potential in our existing life services. We have Plants vs. Zombies. We have Sims. We have Design Home. Clearly, we have FIFA. We have Tap Sports. We have a really meaningful live service business that we see a really strong runway and still, again, and growing that in a profitable way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: And maybe if I could go back to ask another big picture. One, obviously, there continues to be a lot of debate in the industry about distribution and content companies and vertical versus horizontal scale in the industry. Andrew, I want to know as we get deeper into 2023 and even against some of your longer-term thoughts, how are you thinking about scale, both from a distribution standpoint and from a content creation standpoint and how that factors back into possible capital allocation for the company over the medium term.\nAndrew Wilson: Great question. As you might imagine, we spent a great deal of energy thinking through this puzzle. I think on balance that what we have done as a company over the last 40 years has navigated various distribution modalities from cartridge to disk -- floppy disk to cartridge, cartridge to disc, disc to digital, digital to live service. And our expectation is that we'll continue to evolve, and we think we're at the forefront of that, particularly as you think about our live services business.  When we think about scale broadly, I think there are 3 core elements to scale. One is the scale of our network, the amount of players that we interact with each year and each month. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've just hit 700 million, which is an extraordinary amount of people and represents some of the greatest scale in and around our industry.  The second area of scale, of course, is meaningful IP. And what we've discovered over time is that our biggest brands continue to get bigger as we invest in them and this year as we take more ownership over our football brand with FC, but certainly FC and Apex and The Sims and Battlefield and Need for Speed and so many of our great brands that there's a level of portfolio scale that gives us optionality for the future that most in our industry or an entertainment broadly, just simply don't have the benefit of.  But there's another element of our business that I think is the most important, and that's our people. The scale of teams that we have that can deliver titles and content and live services year in, year out and has continue to do that through the ebbs and flows of our industry and through the dramatic consumer trend changes and distribution changes and platform changes. Many other companies have tried. Not many have succeeded as it turns out. And as we look to the future and as we see that interactive entertainment is becoming a more and more important part of entertainment broadly, I think that our team scale is actually one of our greatest strengths. Our ability to launch the number of EA SPORTS games and updates every year, our ability to take Apex to 200 million people, our ability to take The Sims to 70 million people, our ability to bring Battlefield back in an entirely new way in the future and reinvent and rethink what Skate might be as a consumer connection platform around Skate culture.  There are very few companies, if any, in our industry or in entertainment more broadly that can do that at the scale that we can do it. And it's inherent in who we are as a company. We invest deeply in it, in the culture of our organization in really supporting creators. And I think that as we move forward in entertainment that the combination of our network, our IP and, more importantly, our teams gives us the kind of scale that means that we have unbelievable opportunities for growth and certainly opportunities for success as we embark in what will be a new competitive marketplace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. So Andrew, as I hear you talk about the connected ecosystem as well as blockbuster franchises, it seems like the complexity to develop a really successful franchise is only ratcheting higher. And hence, there is probably a higher level of risk around all these projects as well. So do you think you will allow development teams in, say, the nonsports games, not longer lead times to make sure the quality is high and the risk to franchise damage is minimal?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I think it's a great question, and I go back to some of the comments we made earlier, which is as we think about the notion of a game, the definition is evolving pretty dramatically. And so when we think about time for development, it's not just the creation of a world or the development of characters or the telling of a story. It's really about how do we build this as a platform that drives long-term live service business over a 10-plus year period. And I think as we think about supporting and investing in and growing our creating capabilities, our development capabilities, our studio capabilities, that's really where we're investing meaningfully.  And on balance, yes, we will give them more time, and we will let them evolve how they build and what they build and how they launch their games over time. But it's really not just about the complexity of games. It's really about the changing nature of what it is that we're building, but more importantly, the changing nature of how we derive value from that development over the long term. And so where we once built games in 1 year or 2 years and then monetize them over 5 weeks or 5 months, now games as a platform are taking longer, but the benefits are exponentially greater.  And what we're seeing out of FC; and what we're seeing out of Apex; what we're seeing out of The Sims, which again launched in 2014, is meaningful return over a decade's long life cycle. And as we set ourselves up for the future, that's going to be a meaningful part of how we invest in our company, how we invest in the content and service that we provide to players and how we support our development teams to do that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark.\nMichael Hickey: Just two for me. First one, just how you're thinking about industry consolidation, assuming acquisition deal gets brought here, what you think the implications are for the broader industry and on consolidation, Andrew? Second question, not intended to be softball question here, but curious on AI and development, thinking about opportunities, challenges, winners, losers. It seems like you guys have been very proactive here. Already starting to see the success of AI on development, but just curious what you're doing today, the success you're finding, early learnings and how you think about a step-up growth opportunity over the long term.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, great questions. Let me touch on the first part, and then I'll hand over to Laura to provide a little bit more detail on the AI part in terms of what we're doing. So first, as it relates to consolidation, I'm sure you recognize this is a question I get asked a lot. I almost am never allowed to answer that question as it turns out. What I would say is I don't know what's going to happen with Activision and Microsoft. Again, we continue to be Microsoft's biggest partner. I think we're the #1 publisher on their platform. So whether that deal goes through or not is not really material to us broadly. We think we have the scale, again, back to our network, our IP and our talent to continue to navigate the future and lead the future of entertainment and compete in a marketplace regardless of whether that deal goes through or not.  Longer term, will there be industry consolidation? Will there be broader entertainment consolidation? If I was predicting the future over the long term, I would say that's an almost certainty at some level. I would love for us to have the scale to be a meaningful consolidator in that space. I think that we have tremendous assets with respect to the future of entertainment. But as it stands today, I think that we're indifferent as to whether that goes through or not. We feel like we have an incredible strategy. We feel like we have an incredible opportunity. And whether it goes through or not, we will continue to be the number one publisher on the Microsoft platform.  As it relates to AI, I think that, again, as an industry, we're probably going to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of AI broadly. I think that it will allow us to do what we currently do more efficiently. It will allow us to actually do more things as we think about being creators, our ability to use AI to augment our incredible teams and create even more entertainment for an audience that has an insatiable appetite for what we're doing. And then ultimately, to allow AI to help our players and our fans create content in our world represents significant opportunity for us.  One of the things that we are also very cognizant of is there are also fears around AI. Of course, the fear of displacement of the workforce is something that we read a lot about and we talk a lot about. And as we think about every revolution over the course of time from the agriculture revolution through the industrial revolution and on, there has been displacement of the workforce in the near term and then meaningful increases in workforce opportunities over the longer term. And our hope is that AI represents the same opportunity, and we're working very closely inside of our company to ensure that our people benefit in that way and actually facilitate them to do more things.  Of course, then there is the notion of ownership of data and who owns the output of these AI models. And we have the benefit being around for 40 years and having extraordinary amounts of data from which we can use, and Laura will talk a little bit more about that.  And then lastly, of course, it's this notion of what about people -- bad actors using AI. And I think what our plan will be is to work with others in our industry, others in entertainment, others in technology and others in governments and regulators over time to help the laws keep up with the pace of AI so that help consumers, our players, our fans aren't subjected to bad actors and fraudulent behavior as a result of AI in our industry.\nLaura Miele: Yes. Mike, great questions. And Andrew, you framed it, framed the AI picture incredibly well. There's a few things I can add. Clearly, AI has been a cornerstone of innovation for years, and we have a rich history at EA with AI. I mean as we look at this next wave of innovation and technology, we see it to be a powerful accelerator for key areas in our business. And as Andrew mentioned, we are incredibly optimistic actually about our unique competitive advantage given our scale, given our data.  Inputs into AI models will create differentiation, protecting our data for having protected IP that we can create generative content from. We have a rich library and history of assets. So we really like how we're positioned. And also keep in mind that we have great partnerships, and we talked a lot about FC today. We are -- we did a partnership with La Liga, and there's Hawkeye data that we're able to use in our game that is not going to be available -- open -- in an open public marketplace. Again, we really like our position and the advantage that we have given our history and who we are.  And we're thinking about the advantage of this next wave of technology as the accelerator in game development for players and player experience and then as we also think about truly live services at scale. So in game development, you would imagine the velocity of content, creative iteration is going to be advantaged greatly by having really smart content tools. Andrew mentioned the creator content life-like animation, real-time text to speech for players and what that will mean for them and the experiences they have. As we think about live game support at scale, there's going to be some really great imagery detection, issue detection, economic modeling that we're going to be able to apply as we continue to grow these connected ecosystem. So we are pretty optimistic and excited and inspired about this new wave of AI. Again, we have a rich history of it, and we're very optimistic about the years ahead and what it means to our business.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen.\nDouglas Creutz: Just wondered if you could give an update on how the various projects that are associated with the Battlefield IP are progressing and maybe how that plays into some of the things you said earlier about giving your big franchises time to gestate so that they're great when they come out.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I mean we don't have any date announcements or future announcements, if that's the question, certainly this time. What I'd say is I think we've put together an extraordinary creative leadership team. I know we've got the team gathering actually this week in Sweden. I had to call this morning with some of the leadership, and they're very bullish on how that's progressing. I think we've got extraordinary confidence in that team and extraordinary confidence in the progress they're making against the future of that franchise.  And I come back to we're not just building a game. We're building a platform, content as a platform, to drive live services over the decades to come. And so as we continue to move through this process and becomes appropriate, we'll share more about the future of Battlefield. But it is firmly implanted in that first pillar of our strategy: building games and experiences that attract and entertain massive online communities across platforms, across business models, across geographies. And we think that Battlefield is going to be a meaningful part of our future. And we'll share more time and share more as time progresses.  That was our last question. Thank you for being with us. Thank you again to all of our extraordinary teams who delivered an unbelievable Q4 in the face of some macro uncertainty. And we've set us up for a very, very strong FY '24. And of course, congratulations to the Jedi team having just launched an extraordinary blockbuster inside one of the biggest IPs on the planet. See you all next quarter.\nOperator: And that concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Laura Miele",
            "content": "Mario, I'd just like to add some context -- a little bit more context maybe on how we're thinking about mobile -- our mobile growth and even our future beyond this coming year. I mean clearly, we've all have seen mobile grow in the past decade from $11 billion to $106 billion globally, which is massive and significant. But what we'd like to share is that the industry pursued that growth with the philosophy of user acquisition or development for that matter at any cost. And how we're looking at things now is that, that era is over. The economics didn't make sense, and we were really focused on -- the industry was kind of focused on the wrong things.  How we are looking at it and how we -- what we're prioritizing and our new management kind of a refined approach is around profitable growth. So this means equal attention to top line and bottom line in the market and our business dynamics. It's easy, clearly, to focus on top line and just look at that growth area. But when we look at our business and our new management approach, we have seen mobile profitability across our portfolio in the last 2 to 3 years increase. And specifically, when we look at Glu, we've increased 3x from FY '22 to FY '23 and our profitability. So we're really pleased that under our management and how we're thinking about things that we are still focused on growing the overall business in a profitable way.  Now a couple of things. Andrew mentioned and have outlined incredibly well about this connected ecosystem and our connected communities. Mobile is going to play a meaningful role in that. When we look at our FIFA success, which we've talked a lot about in this call already, but it's just so strong and it's been such a meaningful contributor to the overall ecosystem, players that play FIFA HD and mobile generate a far higher daily average revenue than FIFA players who only play on just one platform. So we know that there's a meaningful contribution that mobile can play in the overall ecosystem.  The second area that we're spending a lot of time in is our existing live services. So we talked about earlier about that we launched The Lord of the Rings game clearly. And that has really modeled after our Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes game, which has generated nearly $1.5 billion over the lifetime. When we look at the market and we evaluate what's working, when you look at the top chart in mobile, the top 10 charts in mobile, only 2 entrants have come in the last 2 years. Everything else has been there for quite a long time.  So we see a pretty significant runway and continued growth potential in our existing life services. We have Plants vs. Zombies. We have Sims. We have Design Home. Clearly, we have FIFA. We have Tap Sports. We have a really meaningful live service business that we see a really strong runway and still, again, and growing that in a profitable way. Yes. Mike, great questions. And Andrew, you framed it, framed the AI picture incredibly well. There's a few things I can add. Clearly, AI has been a cornerstone of innovation for years, and we have a rich history at EA with AI. I mean as we look at this next wave of innovation and technology, we see it to be a powerful accelerator for key areas in our business.

So in game development, you would imagine the velocity of content, creative iteration is going to be advantaged greatly by having really smart content tools. Andrew mentioned the creator content life-like animation, real-time text to speech for players and what that will mean for them and the experiences they have. As we think about live game support at scale, there's going to be some really great imagery detection, issue detection, economic modeling that we're going to be able to apply as we continue to grow these connected ecosystem. So we are pretty optimistic and excited and inspired about this new wave of AI. Again, we have a rich history of it, and we're very optimistic about the years ahead and what it means to our business."

            "name": "Christopher Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. And hello, everyone. Our fiscal year 2023 results again demonstrated the fundamental strength of our portfolio, the resiliency of our live services business model and our ability to execute in a disciplined manner. We again outgrew an uneven market, took decisive actions to sharpen our focus and finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter performance.  Our fiscal year was highlighted by significant milestones across our portfolio. In the 6 months since launch, EA SPORTS FIFA 23 has surpassed lifetime sales of EA SPORTS FIFA 22. Apex Legends continued to engage players around the world and following our decision to make the base game free to enter in October, The Sims hit historic engagement highs with tens of millions of new players in the community.  Throughout the year, we continue to take deliberate actions to focus our company and align our business more closely with the strategic priorities that Andrew outlined, culminating with the actions we announced in late March to rationalize our games portfolio and optimize our real estate footprint. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a charge of $155 million, with the remaining charges to be recognized during the first half of fiscal 2024.  For the fourth quarter, net bookings were $1.9 billion, up 11% or 15% in constant currency. Our results exceeded our expectations and reached a new fourth quarter high, driven by a record live services performance and strength in full game. EA SPORTS FIFA significantly outperformed as net bookings grew 31% year-over-year or up 37% in constant currency. Apex Legends also delivered a stronger quarter than anticipated as players returned for Season 16 in our fourth anniversary collection event.  Our live services net bookings were $1.6 billion, up 9% or 13% in constant currency, significantly outperforming our expectations as EA SPORTS FIFA live services delivered a record quarter. FIFA Ultimate Team net bookings grew 20% year-over-year or up 26% in constant currency and saw all-time high engagement. FIFA Online 4 was up 62% or 71% in constant currency, and FIFA Mobile grew triple digits year-over-year and reached its first $100 million net bookings quarter. Apex Legends saw improved performance following a competitive third quarter, rebounding to a low single-digit year-over-year growth quarter in constant currency. And The Sims 4 exceeded expectations as a new expansion pack and free base game updates resonated with the growing community.  Our mobile business, excluding the strong FIFA mobile results, stabilized and delivered in line with our expectations. Our strategy is focused on enhancing player experiences by connecting our largest brands across platforms, delivering blockbuster mobile experiences and optimizing our portfolio for profitable long-term growth. We delivered fourth quarter net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Operating expenses were up 5%, excluding our fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our people costs increased as we continue to invest behind our portfolio, and we also saw higher marketing spend to support new releases. These increases were partially offset by prudent management of other variable spend.  Now let me talk about our full year performance. Our net bookings were $7.3 billion, down 2% or up 1% in constant currency, outperforming uneven market conditions and industry headwinds in mobile. Our net revenue was $7.4 billion for the year, and diluted EPS was $2.88. We generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders.  Now let me turn to the outlook. Our fiscal year 2024 outlook reflects many of the trends we saw in fiscal year 2023. We expect engagement across the portfolio to remain very healthy and our highly reoccurring live services business to show great resilience again. We continue to operate in a competitive market with changing macro conditions. And as such, we will continue to be focused, deliberate and disciplined as we execute against our strategic priorities.  For FX, if rates remain unchanged, we expect a headwind of nearly 2 points for net bookings and 6 points for underlying profit growth, net of hedges relative to last year. We expect fiscal 2024 net bookings to be $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5% year-over-year or up 1% to 7% in constant currency, built on a strong foundation of our evergreen live services, growth in our massive online communities, the introduction of EA SPORTS FC and blockbuster story point through Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.  We expect EA SPORTS FC to deliver low single-digit net bookings growth, building on its momentum growing again on top of a record fiscal year 2023. We expect cost of revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting gross margin expansion, driven by a mix of revenue across royalty-bearing licenses, platform and digital. We expect operating expenses to be $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion with continued focused investments in our business to drive long-term growth. As a result, we expect underlying profitability to grow faster than net bookings.  We expect operating cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and capital expenditures of around $275 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. The business continues to be a strong generator of cash. We expect to continue to repurchase stock under our current authorization, which expires in November 2024. We expect fiscal 2024 net revenue to be $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.81.  Now moving to our outlook for the first quarter. We anticipate net bookings for Q1 to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, up 15% to 23% or up 19% to 27% in constant currency, primarily driven by full game sales of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. For the first quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, cost of revenue to be $350 million to $370 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.14.  Our business is in a strong position propelled by strong brands, massive online communities, blockbuster storytelling and evergreen live services. Our efforts over the last year to align our teams more closely with our key priorities has led to a more focused scope of work, which will help us deliver on our multiyear growth aspirations.  Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew. Andrew, so you're talking about the -- our guide for Q1? Yes. Right. So specifically, our guide in Q1 is driven really by the performance of our live services business. And as you pointed out, we have some year-over-year things on new launches that are driving that performance. No, sorry. And we're happy to sort of take you through sort of line by line on that. But it is relative to the size of the launches, I think, that you're referring. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Exactly as Andrew said, we're seeing an incredible year for FIFA. We talked about it extensively on the call. Actually, FIFA for the full year across all platforms grew 20% this year in constant currency, and that's off of '22 that also grew double digits. And so the momentum in the business has been fantastic.  As we look forward into the launch of FC, as Andrew said, we're really focused on the player experience and making this a great experience. We're pleased to be able to grow the business again off of 2 consecutive years of double-digit growth. Yes, sure. As we gave the guide at the beginning of Q4, we went through a number of planning assumptions that we shared with you in terms of what we saw in terms of player engagement and quality of games and execution. I would say the biggest difference between now and then is, honestly, the performance that we had in Q4. We had an incredibly strong Q4, exceeding our own expectations on a number of fronts that we talked about in the prepared comments. And as we look forward into '24, our outlook and our planning assumptions for '24 in many cases remain unchanged in the sense that all the things that we focus on, which is quality of games, execution and delivery of our resilient live services, those remain quite stable and consistent and unchanged. And I would say that the comp is just quite a bit higher. Great. The only thing I'd add to what Andrew said about Star Wars is that as exactly as we said, we're incredibly excited about the launch. This is a title that we expect to contribute to our financial performance for a very long time. And so we're in early days.  In terms of The Lord of the Rings mobile launch, again, another title we're very pleased at in terms of the quality of the game and the expectations around it. We are being modest and prudent in terms of the underlying implied financial performance within our guide, consistent with what we've talked about in terms of launches of some of our other titles over the last couple of quarters. Let me address your first question. I'll start there and then I sort of missed the first part of your second question, so if you could repeat that here in a second. But in terms of the mobile growth for next year, our expectations are that mobile business in aggregate will be down year-on-year after FY '23, a large part of that related to the decision to sunset the Apex mobile title, and so that obviously is in the comparable for '23. It won't be in the comparable for '24, and that's a big piece of the mobile business revenue performance expectation for '24. And can you go ahead and repeat your second question? I missed the first part of it. Got it. Okay. It's FC. I missed the part which game you're referring to. So thank you for that clarification. As we think about the transition to FC, we really are focused on the player experience and making this transition, a great one for our fans around the world. We are going to invest behind that across our brand, rebrand launching as well. And so as you think about the total economics of the business, I would not anticipate it being materially different year-on-year."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Stuart. I hope all of you are well. I want to start by sharing how inspired and proud I am of our teams. Against macro uncertainty and constant change, we navigated the year with resilience and determination. Throughout fiscal year 2023, we showed the strength of our business, delivered for our players and lived up to the promise of our values. To every EA employee, thank you.  Over the fiscal year, we executed across our business, delivering high-quality games, launching 7 new releases and providing over 450 content updates across 51 titles. Consumer appetite for interactive entertainment experiences is at an all-time high. And with our player network expanding to nearly 700 million, we delivered record engagement across some of our biggest franchises.  EA is leading the future of interactive entertainment in a dynamic industry where new audiences, new technology and new media trends are reshaping the world around us. Consumption of sports and entertainment is accelerating, and media trends are evolving. We see these transformations as immense opportunities to do more amazing things for our people and our players.  As we look to the future, we're focused on delivering against 3 key strategies: building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities, creating blockbuster interactive storytelling and amplifying the power of community in and around our games with social and creative tools. Executing these strategies across the modalities of play, watch, create and connect will lay the foundation for long-term growth as we write the next great chapter of EA story.  Fiscal year 2023 was an amazing year for EA SPORTS FIFA with the entire ecosystem producing incredible results. Console, mobile and PC both premium and free-to-play, delivered double-digit growth in net bookings, and FIFA 23 became the best-selling title in franchise history. Our interactive experiences are at the heart of global football culture and fandom and are a testament to a strategy sharpened by 30 years of passion, creativity and innovation.  Fiscal year 2024 stands to be another important year for EA SPORTS. We will build on the massive momentum in our global football ecosystem, delivering expanded enhanced experience for fans, EA SPORTS FC. In April, we unveiled the brand identity and vision for EA SPORTS FC. By every measure, this was the biggest brand moment ever created at EA, reaching billions of potential players generating thousands of media hits within days and inspiring record positive sentiment amongst our players with the support of hundreds of partners, athletes, leagues, federations and clubs. With EA SPORTS FC, we are building a fan-first future for global football, and we cannot wait to share more in July.  Already, the world's permanent American football experience, Madden NFL delivered an extraordinary amount of content in and around the game in fiscal year 2023, driving deep engagement and becoming the best-selling title in this franchise's history on console and PC. Madden NFL 24 will build on this excitement, offering even more fun and immersive game play.  Our fourth quarter saw a resurgence in Apex Legends performance. Season 16 powered by massive game enhancements like a new class system transformed the way core Legends played. Our strong community of players responded favorably, lifting peak engagement more than 20% from the previous season. The resilience of Apex Legends reinforces its unique position as an IP with a power to consistently entertain players as they play, watch and compete in an evolving world. Throughout fiscal year 2023, Apex entertained an average of 20 million monthly active users. This player loyalty is fueled by responsibility to continuously expand and improve the player experience.  No other game in the industry celebrates creativity and individuality quite like The Sims. This diverse and passionate community has fueled imagination and champion self-expression since its launch in 2014, growing to over 70 million players worldwide and counting. Our talented team at Maxis Studios is using the power of creation and connection to shape culture, developing new experiences for The Sims 4 to take entertainment to unimaginable heights.  To continually inspire the world to play, we are focused on blockbuster storytelling. Our history and leadership of bringing together culture-defining IP with interactive entertainment creates incredible opportunities to build an unrivaled portfolio bolstered by powerful collaborations. These are fundamental ways to bring more players into our global network through the lasting power that only blockbusters can deliver.  Just 11 days ago, we delivered on this priority with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. This incredible game has received widespread positive reviews earned an 86 Metacritic score on console and has been called a Game of the Year contender by multiple press outlets. Our dev teams are working with the community around some high-end PC specs. And beyond this, it has been a strong launch. Within the first few weeks, millions of players have joined Cal Kestis and BD-1 in a rebellion against the empire. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is storytelling at its finest, which is central to the game's success and to our creative collaboration with The Walt Disney Company and Lucasfilm. The game is pure blockbuster entertainment and fans have embraced the story of our Jedi games as a central part of the Star Wars saga, demonstrating how great interactive entertainment can grow and deepen the fandom of an incredibly powerful IP universe.  Games are the social networks of the future. To amplify the power of community, we are innovating across a set of social and creative tools in and around our games. Our strategy is to help players make new friends, build their social network and create community. These in-game social experiences were rolled out in FIFA 23. Among players that are interacting with a new feature set, engagement increased over 150%. Our data shows these innovations are driving results in our business and confirm what we know to be true: having more friends and building stronger friendships in our network leads to more time spent playing and connecting.  As a cornerstone of our priorities of growth, we will continue to implement these tools across our portfolio. With a strong close to fiscal year 2023, we are executing on our core strategies, and our focused investments are positioned to drive results across our content and services pipeline. We remain committed to capturing our biggest opportunities and delivering long-term value in our business by doing more amazing things for our players and communities.  Now I hand the call over to Chris to provide additional details on our business. Thanks, Chris. Interactive entertainment is at an inflection point. The industry is expanding, the number of players expect to grow significantly over the coming years. The audience is becoming more diverse with cultural and generational trends accelerating content consumption. Engaging this expanding player base means reaching them on devices everywhere through disruptive technologies.  For EA, these transformations represent opportunities to grow today and over the long term. We have the best talent in the industry to execute against our long-term strategy. It's through their passion and creativity that we will continue to deliver on our mission to inspire the world to play. We are focused on bringing more amazing games to more people around the world, inspiring them to build community, celebrate shared fandom and have joyful experiences. The future of entertainment is interactive, and no team is better equipped to lead this transformation than EA.  Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. I think it's a great question. As we look at the marketplace and as we look at consumer trends, I think there's 2 things happening right now. One, which -- and both kind of end us in the same place. But I think one is more short term, and one has as much longer term -- more longer-term ramifications.  The first is that any time through the history of our industry, that there is any kind of consumer softness or consumer trepidation around spending also macroeconomic uncertainty. What we typically see is consumers move towards the biggest brands and the biggest titles and the most recognizable experiences. And that really comes down to kind of general consumer behavior, which is they have less money that they're willing to risk against new things or smaller things or unknown things. And typically, our brands like FIFA, like Madden, like The Sims have performed very well at these times.  That, however, is a moment in time. And our expectation is that as we move through this particular phase and as consumer spending continues to strengthen over time, that there will be opportunities for new titles and new brands. What -- but what we don't think that will outweigh is this movement to these broader social ecosystems that are games, games as platforms. At the very call, we are a games company, but what we are seeing is the evolution of the definition of a game.  And you hear us talk about play, watch, create, connect. And it's really that last piece, that connection piece, that is driving the future of our business. And as we think about building FC for the future, as we think about building The Sims for the future and Battlefield and Apex and Skate and other properties in our portfolio, we really think about that in the context of building games as a platform or content as a platform to drive these long-term businesses across play, watch, create, connect. We think this will be longer-lasting than the present kind of macroeconomic climate. And certainly, that's where we're investing in meaningful parts of our time, money and resources over the coming years.  That's not to take away from the opportunity to launch incredible things like Jedi, which we've just done, which tell unbelievable stories in an interactive world and become a meaningful part of a bigger brand IP like we have with Star Wars. But certainly, as we balance out our investment over time, a great portion of our investment will go into these building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities. We'll then follow up with a more focused, deliberate investment against telling blockbuster interactive stories, and we think that there will be opportunity for investment over time with the extension of these social and credit tools, both for the in-game experience and beyond the game experience broadly. And you'll see us do some more of that, particularly in the world of EA SPORTS in the coming year. I'll touch on this broadly, and I'll let Chris kind of talk a little bit more on the details of how we're forecasting and planning. First and foremost, we're coming off an extraordinary year. Football as a sport is growing globally. We think the World Cup did great things for continuing to grow the sport broadly and the fan ecosystem around the sport. I think what we've been able to do with our football franchise is really become central to the fabric of football culture, and the results that you are seeing is really demonstrative of that importance that we play in that fan football culture.  My belief and my belief all along has been that as we move through this rebrand, and certainly as we talked about in the prepared remarks, this rebrand was probably the single biggest rebrand moment in the history of the company and almost certainly the most successful by a fairly wide margin. We've never seen this kind of consumer energy and this kind of positive consumer energy around a launch of this nature, particularly for a business that we've been in for 30 years.  And so I continue to believe that moving through this rebrand actually presents us extraordinary opportunities for growth, and I've talked about this before and the context of what we can do for the player broadly, how we can extend the play, watch, create, connect, experience, how we can extend the relationships that we have with commercial brands that are equally valuable in football fan culture over time. And I think that as we move through this year, and you see what we're doing in the context of the game experience and what's going on around that, we feel very bullish and very confident around growth opportunities of our football business. But we're coming off a pretty big year, and it's a pretty big comp, and so I'll hand off to Chris to kind of talk you through how we're thinking about that. Yes. On the Jedi piece, and I'll let Chris touch on Lord of The Rings, maybe Laura can give you a little bit more color on the launch of that and what we expect. On Jedi, again, we're overjoyed. We made the bold decision to move the title 6 weeks to give the team the opportunity to really get to the quality of games they wanted. And of course, as you heard in our prepared remarks, the quality has been very, very strong, and many are proclaiming is going to be a game of the year contender. And certainly, playing it and speaking to people who are playing it, it represents incredible storytelling in the Star Wars universe. And so I think we're building on where we were with Jedi: Fallen Order. And we're -- and it's certainly been a very strong launch for us. It was very early. I think we're 11 days in at this point. We're in a different kind of market dynamic, but I would tell you it's pacing very strongly against our expectations and against Jedi: Fallen Order. Yes. I think what you've heard from us, and certainly the performance in Q4 is testament to this, is Apex is one of the strongest franchise in our industry and certainly one of our strongest franchise when we talk about content as a platform, a game experience as a platform, Apex is certainly front and center as we think about our business model. We have a substantial player base with incredible retention. And as is the nature of these free-to-play environment, there are ebbs and flows. And I think what is unique to Apex is its ability to engage and reengage through those ebbs and flows.  We're going to continue to invest in the IP broadly, both geographically from a platform, extending play, extending story. And for what it's worth, I don't think anything is off the table. I think that as we think about game IP today, it's kind of like comic book IP of 20 or 30 years ago. This is the IP that Gen Z and Gen Alpha perhaps identify mostly with, and I think the opportunities for us to continue to grow and expand and stretch the nature of the experiences that we're able to offer to our global player base over the next decade and beyond is unfettered. Great question. As you might imagine, we spent a great deal of energy thinking through this puzzle. I think on balance that what we have done as a company over the last 40 years has navigated various distribution modalities from cartridge to disk -- floppy disk to cartridge, cartridge to disc, disc to digital, digital to live service. And our expectation is that we'll continue to evolve, and we think we're at the forefront of that, particularly as you think about our live services business.  When we think about scale broadly, I think there are 3 core elements to scale. One is the scale of our network, the amount of players that we interact with each year and each month. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've just hit 700 million, which is an extraordinary amount of people and represents some of the greatest scale in and around our industry.  The second area of scale, of course, is meaningful IP. And what we've discovered over time is that our biggest brands continue to get bigger as we invest in them and this year as we take more ownership over our football brand with FC, but certainly FC and Apex and The Sims and Battlefield and Need for Speed and so many of our great brands that there's a level of portfolio scale that gives us optionality for the future that most in our industry or an entertainment broadly, just simply don't have the benefit of.  But there's another element of our business that I think is the most important, and that's our people. The scale of teams that we have that can deliver titles and content and live services year in, year out and has continue to do that through the ebbs and flows of our industry and through the dramatic consumer trend changes and distribution changes and platform changes. Many other companies have tried. Not many have succeeded as it turns out. And as we look to the future and as we see that interactive entertainment is becoming a more and more important part of entertainment broadly, I think that our team scale is actually one of our greatest strengths. Our ability to launch the number of EA SPORTS games and updates every year, our ability to take Apex to 200 million people, our ability to take The Sims to 70 million people, our ability to bring Battlefield back in an entirely new way in the future and reinvent and rethink what Skate might be as a consumer connection platform around Skate culture.  There are very few companies, if any, in our industry or in entertainment more broadly that can do that at the scale that we can do it. And it's inherent in who we are as a company. We invest deeply in it, in the culture of our organization in really supporting creators. And I think that as we move forward in entertainment that the combination of our network, our IP and, more importantly, our teams gives us the kind of scale that means that we have unbelievable opportunities for growth and certainly opportunities for success as we embark in what will be a new competitive marketplace. Yes. I think it's a great question, and I go back to some of the comments we made earlier, which is as we think about the notion of a game, the definition is evolving pretty dramatically. And so when we think about time for development, it's not just the creation of a world or the development of characters or the telling of a story. It's really about how do we build this as a platform that drives long-term live service business over a 10-plus year period. And I think as we think about supporting and investing in and growing our creating capabilities, our development capabilities, our studio capabilities, that's really where we're investing meaningfully.  And on balance, yes, we will give them more time, and we will let them evolve how they build and what they build and how they launch their games over time. But it's really not just about the complexity of games. It's really about the changing nature of what it is that we're building, but more importantly, the changing nature of how we derive value from that development over the long term. And so where we once built games in 1 year or 2 years and then monetize them over 5 weeks or 5 months, now games as a platform are taking longer, but the benefits are exponentially greater.  And what we're seeing out of FC; and what we're seeing out of Apex; what we're seeing out of The Sims, which again launched in 2014, is meaningful return over a decade's long life cycle. And as we set ourselves up for the future, that's going to be a meaningful part of how we invest in our company, how we invest in the content and service that we provide to players and how we support our development teams to do that. Yes, great questions. Let me touch on the first part, and then I'll hand over to Laura to provide a little bit more detail on the AI part in terms of what we're doing. So first, as it relates to consolidation, I'm sure you recognize this is a question I get asked a lot. I almost am never allowed to answer that question as it turns out. What I would say is I don't know what's going to happen with Activision and Microsoft. Again, we continue to be Microsoft's biggest partner. I think we're the #1 publisher on their platform. So whether that deal goes through or not is not really material to us broadly. We think we have the scale, again, back to our network, our IP and our talent to continue to navigate the future and lead the future of entertainment and compete in a marketplace regardless of whether that deal goes through or not.  Longer term, will there be industry consolidation? Will there be broader entertainment consolidation? If I was predicting the future over the long term, I would say that's an almost certainty at some level. I would love for us to have the scale to be a meaningful consolidator in that space. I think that we have tremendous assets with respect to the future of entertainment. But as it stands today, I think that we're indifferent as to whether that goes through or not. We feel like we have an incredible strategy. We feel like we have an incredible opportunity. And whether it goes through or not, we will continue to be the number one publisher on the Microsoft platform.  As it relates to AI, I think that, again, as an industry, we're probably going to be one of the greatest beneficiaries of AI broadly. I think that it will allow us to do what we currently do more efficiently. It will allow us to actually do more things as we think about being creators, our ability to use AI to augment our incredible teams and create even more entertainment for an audience that has an insatiable appetite for what we're doing. And then ultimately, to allow AI to help our players and our fans create content in our world represents significant opportunity for us.  One of the things that we are also very cognizant of is there are also fears around AI. Of course, the fear of displacement of the workforce is something that we read a lot about and we talk a lot about. And as we think about every revolution over the course of time from the agriculture revolution through the industrial revolution and on, there has been displacement of the workforce in the near term and then meaningful increases in workforce opportunities over the longer term. And our hope is that AI represents the same opportunity, and we're working very closely inside of our company to ensure that our people benefit in that way and actually facilitate them to do more things.  Of course, then there is the notion of ownership of data and who owns the output of these AI models. And we have the benefit being around for 40 years and having extraordinary amounts of data from which we can use, and Laura will talk a little bit more about that.  And then lastly, of course, it's this notion of what about people -- bad actors using AI. And I think what our plan will be is to work with others in our industry, others in entertainment, others in technology and others in governments and regulators over time to help the laws keep up with the pace of AI so that help consumers, our players, our fans aren't subjected to bad actors and fraudulent behavior as a result of AI in our industry. Yes. I mean we don't have any date announcements or future announcements, if that's the question, certainly this time. What I'd say is I think we've put together an extraordinary creative leadership team. I know we've got the team gathering actually this week in Sweden. I had to call this morning with some of the leadership, and they're very bullish on how that's progressing. I think we've got extraordinary confidence in that team and extraordinary confidence in the progress they're making against the future of that franchise.  And I come back to we're not just building a game. We're building a platform, content as a platform, to drive live services over the decades to come. And so as we continue to move through this process and becomes appropriate, we'll share more about the future of Battlefield. But it is firmly implanted in that first pillar of our strategy: building games and experiences that attract and entertain massive online communities across platforms, across business models, across geographies. And we think that Battlefield is going to be a meaningful part of our future. And we'll share more time and share more as time progresses.  That was our last question. Thank you for being with us. Thank you again to all of our extraordinary teams who delivered an unbelievable Q4 in the face of some macro uncertainty. And we've set us up for a very, very strong FY '24. And of course, congratulations to the Jedi team having just launched an extraordinary blockbuster inside one of the biggest IPs on the planet. See you all next quarter."

During Q3, EA entertained hundreds of millions of fans through our games and multi-platform live services. Our teams delivered high quality experiences reaching global communities, providing 128 content updates across 36 titles. We launched two new AAA releases: NHL 23 in October, and Need for Speed Unbound in December, both earning strong reception and positive reviews. The just-released Dead Space has also earned high praise from fans and critics alike, being dubbed \u201ca new benchmark for remakes\u201d and even \u201cone of the best games of all time.\u201d We drove record engagement during the quarter on some of our biggest franchises, even surpassing historical highs delivered over the last several years. Our player network also continues to grow, now over 650 million. While we delivered for our players and engagement was strong in the quarter, the macro environment remained challenging and impacted Q3 results.  During the quarter we took measured action to reduce our expenses, and we continue to exercise cost discipline, further focusing our investments in key areas of growth. As we navigate the short-term, we remain focused on what fuels our business: delivering high quality entertainment and driving strong engagement across our global network. The passion and enthusiasm for interactive entertainment continues to grow. For more and more people around the world, games are a cherished and authentic way to stay connected with the people they care about, build community, and find joy through shared experiences. Across all of entertainment, people are diving deeper and engaging further with their favorite franchises. EA SPORTS FIFA is at the heart of global football culture, and once again we delivered strong engagement in Q3 across our entire ecosystem.  Year-to-date net bookings from our FIFA franchise has grown 4% or 15% at constant currency. FIFA 23 is pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history, delivering record engagement in Q3. In North America alone unit sales are up over 50% year-over-year. FIFA Mobile engagement was up triple digits in Q3, and FIFA Online in Asia is hitting the highest monthly active users in years. This engagement fueled strong financial performance. We have incredible momentum in our global football ecosystem. For 30 years we\u2019ve been leaders in interactive football and collaborated with the most extensive network of partners spanning the globe. Our games are interwoven with the fabric of football fandom, averaging 300 million hours of gameplay every month. We are unbelievably excited to take this energy into the future with our EA SPORTS FC brand, where we'll deliver even more for fans as part of an expanding experience with endless ways to play, watch, create and connect through their love of football. Madden NFL is the world\u2019s preeminent interactive American football experience and one of the most powerful franchises in sports. We continue to invest in innovation to drive engagement and growth across this mega-franchise. Madden NFL 23 had a solid holiday quarter driven by Ultimate Team, and Madden NFL Mobile launched a new season and multiple in-game events further powering engagement. With big moments ahead, like Super Bowl LVII and Team of The Year, Madden NFL will continue to entertain millions of fans. Our EA SPORTS & Racing teams are the best in the business. The convergence of sport and entertainment is picking up pace. Through our investments in technology and new experiences, we will continue to push the boundaries and blur the lines between the digital and physical by empowering players to come together, express their fandom, and build online communities, both in and around our games. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world, with mega-franchises like Apex Legends and The Sims. Apex Legends has historically had a quieter Q3 as the live service model ebbs and flows against a seasonally crowded launch slate this time of the year.  Moving into Q4, we\u2019re already seeing a rise in engagement as we approach the game\u2019s four-year anniversary and the launch of a new season, bringing highly anticipated updates and fresh content. Apex is one of the few IPs in its genre with proven endurance to engage and re-engage players as they play, watch, and compete. The Sims is also evolving and growing as a live service. In Q3 we took the base game free to enter and welcomed over 10 million new players into the community, driving strong engagement. Our teams are gearing up to add more collaborative ways to further empower our community to unleash their imaginations. We have incredible opportunities ahead. To do more extraordinary things in service of our players and our people, we are making deliberate decisions and reallocating investments to prioritize our biggest growth areas, building global online communities around our biggest franchises, telling incredible interactive stories, and harnessing the power of our social ecosystem to create meaningful connections. Our teams are deeply committed to delivering incredible experiences for our players. As part of this commitment, we have made the player-first decision to move Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\u2019s launch date to April 28. The game is a creative and innovative leap forward, going further into the experience of a Jedi, delivering more content, more exploration, and more fun.  Anticipation for the game is incredibly high and the Respawn team known around the world for delivering top quality entertainment is focusing on the final polish stage to enhance performance, stability, and most importantly, the player experience. Giving the team these extra few weeks to deliver the best experience for our players will not only result in a higher quality game, but puts us in a best position to grow the long-term value of the franchise. We\u2019re also making strategic decisions around two mobile titles. Apex Legends Mobile won game of the year on both iPhone and Android. Despite this strong start, the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations of our players. After months of working with our development partner, we have made the mutual decision to sunset this version of the game. We\u2019ve learned a great deal and have plans to reimagine a connected Apex mobile experience in the future. It is through these learnings, combined with a clear franchise strategy, that we\u2019ve also made the decision to stop the development of the current Battlefield mobile title. We know our community values a deeply connected ecosystem and our team is focused on delivering the best, unified cross-platform experience for our players. Everything we do is designed to inspire the world to play. As a company, our teams have demonstrated that with a culture of creativity, innovation and resilience, we can grow through transformative periods of change and lead the future of entertainment. As we look ahead, our teams remain focused and disciplined as we reshape our investments toward a future of accelerated content generation, increased direct player engagement and deeply connected ecosystems to bring more people into our global community. We are taking strategic actions to evaluate our cost structure as we navigate through the current macro environment.  With our exceptional talent, our broad portfolio of amazing IP, and massive player network, we remain committed to delivering long-term value in our business. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thank you. As Andrew shared, we delivered strong engagement and high-quality titles again in Q3. Nevertheless, our results were mixed relative to our expectations. Based on Q2 trends and leading indicators, we had built our Q3 guidance on four key underlying assumptions: First, that our player network would continue to expand, and engagement metrics remain healthy. Second, we would see strong momentum for FIFA, our global football franchise. Third, that we would release high-quality new games into the market; and finally, that Apex would experience its typical seasonal low in Q3. While these assumptions were directionally correct, net bookings came in short of our expectations. We achieved new highs in our player network, sustained healthy engagement trends, and delivered a record quarter for the entire EA SPORTS FIFA franchise. However, the performance of new games, despite strong reviews, and of the Apex franchise, was below the levels we had anticipated, reflecting the challenging market dynamics.  Recognizing the softer net bookings trend, we proactively took focused measures during the quarter to reduce our costs and lessen the impact on our underlying profitability. Now let\u2019s go through the quarter in more detail. Net bookings for the third quarter were $2.3 billion, down 9% or 5% in constant currency, driven largely by a tough comp as we lap the launch of Battlefield 2042 and by Apex performance, partially offset by strength across the entire FIFA ecosystem and the launch of \u2018Need for Speed Unbound.\u2019 Madden 23 was level with a very strong quarter last year. Our life services net bookings were down 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Growth at constant currency was driven by strength in FIFA, with rapid growth occurring in FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 75% of our business. We delivered Q3 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year.  Operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis, driven by lower marketing spend as we lap the Battlefield 2042 launch. Further, we reduced costs by just over $60 million by moderating our hiring and prioritizing our variable spend in the quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion and we returned $377 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, moving to guidance. As we navigate an uncertain market, I\u2019d like to share more context about how we set our Q4 guidance. First and most important, we expect we will continue to execute well on the two most important drivers of our long-term success and growth: strong player engagement and the production of high-quality games, like the just-released and well-reviewed Dead Space.  Second, we are confident that EA SPORTS FIFA will sustain and build on the strong momentum that we exited Q3 with. And third, based on our Q3 launch results, we\u2019re taking a more measured approach for the highly anticipated Q4 launches. Next, we are committed to operational excellence and being disciplined in our investment decisions. The actions we\u2019ve taken during Q3 will reduce our total H2 operating expenses by approximately $140 million. In addition, we will continue to work to prioritize, spend broadly, evaluate our real estate footprint, and focus our investments on our best long-term growth opportunities. And finally, our Q4 guidance reflects the player-first decision to shift the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to Q1-FY24. It\u2019s important to note that while it changes the timing of reported net bookings, it does not change the overall lifetime economics, nor our expectations around free cash flow for Q4 or FY24. Now, on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are revising our Q4 net bookings guidance to $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion, which reflects the shift of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to Q1, our decision to sunset Apex Mobile and updated expectations based on Q3 trends, in particular for launches happening in the quarter. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.  We expect operating expenses to be $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion for the quarter, approximately $80 million lower than our previous expectation, reflecting our ongoing efforts to prioritize and focus our investment. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.05 to $0.20 for the fourth quarter. This Q4 guidance results in fiscal year net bookings of $7.07 billion to $7.17 billion. We are also revising our guidance for operating cash flow as a result of the updated net bookings guidance to $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that results in free cash flow of about $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. For further details on our fiscal 2023 guidance, including our GAAP guidance, please see our press release. Before handing it back to Andrew, I\u2019d like to provide a few early thoughts on our fiscal 2024. As we look to next year, we see the main drivers of our business being our durable broad portfolio of live services. Our newly rebranded EA SPORTS FC franchise, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, plus additional titles we will announce in due course.  Excluding the impact of FX, we expect mid-single digit growth on net bookings and low double-digit growth on underlying profitability. If rates remain unchanged from today, that would equate to mid-single digit growth for both top and bottom line. Our business is anchored by incredible brands, evergreen live services, high quality games, and a growing player network. We will be focused on our investments as we build and scale our business, all while delivering amazing experiences for our players. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. We drove incredible engagement and delivered high quality experiences in the quarter. As Chris shared, we are being disciplined and focused on what we can control to fuel our biggest growth opportunities. We are confident in our vision for the future, and with our exceptional talent, proven IP, and growing player network, EA is operating from a position of strength. Our audiences have an insatiable appetite for interactive entertainment and are engaging more deeply with the experiences they love. The future of entertainment is interactive, and no team is better equipped than EA to deliver amazing games and content to inspire the world to play. Now, Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Regina, we are ready for questions now. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Thank you, Andrew, Chris and Laura. I wanted to \u2013 I would hope you could provide a little bit more color. I'm trying to reconcile some of the comments, from the press release and slide deck and your comments here. On the one hand it seems like certain titles are doing extraordinarily well; FIFA, Sims, but then in your guidance, you kind of update the expectations for Q4 based here, in particular around launches in games on Q4. So it kind of implies maybe the smaller medium sized titles aren't performing.  So one, I was just curious if that's true; and two, what gives you the confidence that it's mostly macro and not competitive pressures across the other broader industry? \nChris Suh : Sure. Hi Andrew! This is Chris. I could take this one. So in my prepared commentaries I talked about what we saw in Q3 and the specific trend I point to is the fact that we talked about strong player engagement and high quality titles. But I also talked about the fact that the highly rated titles didn't perform to the level that we would expect it based on historical expectations for a title of that caliber.  And so we're taking some of those learnings, and I do think that you know when we look at all the data and we analyze what we saw in terms of demand and results, we do believe that that's a reflection of the overall market conditions that we saw continued to mount throughout the quarter, and we've taken those learnings and we applied those into the Q4 guidance. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then just on the mobile side, what kind of learnings are you kind of taking from Apex Mobile, because it was Game of the Year, but clearly you struggled with a little bit of engagement. Is it who made it; is it the game \u2013 you know it\u2019s just too PC based? Could you share kind of the learnings that you've taken away to determine why to cancel this one and cancel the Battlefield title? \nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, great question, and I do believe we've learned a great deal as we've gone through this. Certainly, this game was in development for a long period of time as the expectation for the size and scale and complexity of mobile games continues to grow as the platform continues to mature over time.  As we look at it, we really kind of compartmentalize into a few key categories. First, as you point out, this was a really good game built by really good teams, and it won game of year on both Apple and Android devices, which is an extraordinary achievement given the amount of games that are made.  But a couple of things also were true inside of that: One is, there is a level of immersion and complexity to Apex Game Play in particular, which is very much about what Apex is about, verticality of game play and team based play that didn't translate quite as well to mobile devices as we had hoped. I think we've learned a great deal from that.  Second is, the game while it really engaged the core deeply, and it actually attracted a lot of new users, which we think speaks volumes for the future success potential of the franchise, it didn't retain the more casual user at the rate that we needed it to, and in a game that relies a lot on team play and competitive play, liquidity of the overall player base is really, really important as you think about the future experience of players over time.  And then third, I think the mobile market continues to be challenging, and we certainly saw \u2013 you know we launched into what was a soft mobile market, and with some changing and evolving kind of player personalities as we move through.  So as we think about this on a go forward basis, we take those learnings and we apply the real strengths, which is we know Apex has incredible demand from both the core users and new more casual users. We know that we have the underlying ingredients to make an incredible game. We need to be thoughtful about the nature of the core game mechanics and the retention mechanics that we build into the game over time, and most importantly, as we look at the mobile market, the biggest new launches that are seeing the most success are the ones that are deeply connected to the broader franchise, where there's not always cross play, but it's certainly cross progression and a feeling that they are part of a single unified community and a single unified game experience.  And so as we think about that for the future, that will be very, very important as we reimagine Apex Mobile. And certainly as we had those learning from Apex Mobile and we were developing into Battlefield Mobile, we anticipated that while Battlefield had also been in development for some time and was making good progress, given the construct of that game, it also was probably going to run with some of the same challenges, and rather than continue to push against that, we wanted to come back, take a breath, reset and really think about the broader franchise strategy and allow the leadership to build a true cross platform immersive game experience around a reimagined battlefield in the future.  Both of these things represent strong learning opportunities for us, and both of these things represent an ability for us as a company to lean into two great franchises in a way that the mobile market is more aligned to for the future. \nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. I really appreciate that color. Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nEric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe building on Andrew's questions, so I want to come back first to mobile. You know how do you think about the array of type of content you have on the mobile side, and how much of it is potentially exposed to sort of casual play that might act in a more sort of hyper sort of volatile mode as consumer monetization might be volatile, depending on what happens with consumer spending going forward, versus maybe some of your sports titles and mobile that have a very different trajectory from a spend perspective. So I want to sort of broaden out the conversation to what you're actually seeing on the spend side across an array of mobile that really runs the gamut first.  And then second, I think we've seen a lot of folks in the industry talk about pushing titles out, out of \u201822 now and into \u201923 and calendar \u201923 and maybe even calendar \u201924. Is there a broader theme emerging around getting titles right before they launch, or are there elements where you need to see the council cycle possibly be maybe deeper into what it's happened over the last couple of years to maybe see the success. You want to see with some of the titles.  How should we think about the broader narrative around content being pushed out across the industry and with you guys idiosyncratically? Thanks. \nAndrew Wilson : Okay, that is two solid questions. Let me start and then maybe Chris and Laura can provide some color as we get in. First off on mobile, I think a few things that we start with, and certainly I think that we, you know we think through on a daily basis, which is while the mobile market continues to be a very challenging market to find success in, it also continues to be the world's largest gaming platform and certainly has the ability to attract more plays than any other platform. And so for us it will always be a very important part of our go forward franchise strategy.  When we think about mobile broadly, we really think about the titles fitting into two key categories. The first category is what you speak to in the connective sports, but it's also true for Sims and Apex and Battlefield, and will be true for Skate, which is how is it part of a broader cross platform global community of play, and how do we unite and unify global communities of players around their core IP regardless of where they play on PC, mobile or console.  This for us represents probably our strongest opportunity in mobile and certainly where you'll see us begin to really invest. When you look at what's been happening with FIFI up triple digits, it's really as we've started to bring the mobile title closer to the core franchise and start to operate it as a singular business with a unified play community around the world. It\u2019s how we're building for Skate, it\u2019s how we're going to build for the future of the Sims, and with these decisions around Apex and Battlefield, it\u2019s also how we\u2019ll build for those franchises.  That represents an extraordinary opportunity for us to attract a much bigger global community to our biggest IP. It represents an opportunity to grow monetization on the mobile platform, but it also represents an opportunity to provide alternative ways for our existing core audiences who plan console and PC, to play when they are away from those core devices they have. And as we look at the mobile market on a go forward basis, we think that that will be where we\u2019ll find real strength for that part of our business. The other part is, the stand alone mobile native titles, and we have a number of titles that continue to perform exceptionally well. Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, The Sims, some of the titles that we got as part of our Glu acquisition, Golf Clash. We'll continue to invest in those as well, but you should expect that as we think about the future, we're going to really lay our investment into our bigger franchise play. We will continue to drive the long term value of our existing standalone mobile titles and will probably invest less in new startup standalone titles, just because we think that's probably not where we will find strength in the industry over time.  To hit your second part around title launches, and certainly I think we're hearing more about that across the industry, and I just, I\u2019d separate what you are hearing from us with everything that you're hearing around the industry broadly. While it might be \u2013 it might make sense to kind of draw a broader narrative, I think for us as we look at it, we launched a number of titles in Q3 and Q4 certainly with Dead Space and Need For Speed and NHL some of our smaller titles, and FIFA and Madden, we've launched an incredible amount of titles on time and at tremendous high quality.  I think what we saw with Jedi, was this is an incredibly large game. It's you know both, immersive and creative and innovative, and the team just have come down the home stretch and really want to get to quality. And when we think about quality, quality is really a combination of three things: Innovation, Creativity and Polish. And that last element Polish, the removal of bugs and the removal of potential play frustrations is as important as the innovation and the creativity itself.  And so as we look at our future, we feel that we've been executing extremely well till this point, around the titles and the title updates that we've been launching. We also feel incredibly bullish and positive around the trajectory of Jedi. And when the team came and sat down and said, \u2018Hey, if you let us have just a few more weeks, we think we can deliver even higher quality.\u2019  We really wanted to get behind and support them. After all, this is an incredible team with the first iteration of the franchise that they launched. They broke all kinds of records. They are deeply committed to the franchise, deeply committed to our partners at Disney and deeply committed to our players, and we really wanted to get behind them and support it, especially as it will not impact the overall health of the franchise. In fact, it will not only last with a better quality, but almost certainly increase the lifetime value of the franchise over time. \nEric Sheridan : Thanks Andrew. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nStephen Ju : Okay, thanks. So Andrew, you know we do have a bit of a setback in the transition to mobile, given the developments across Apex and Battlefield. So naturally this makes us worry a little bit more about how Glu was coming along, because the thesis at the time of the acquisition was to bring some of the success that has had in the more, shall we say the casual sports franchises in exporting that dynamic of FIFA, Madden, etc. So can you update us on your progress there?  And I guess FIFA Online 4, triple digits, that's a pretty remarkable result, and I presume there will be a lot of that is due to the World Cup. So you know, what do you think the Nexon and/or the Tencent team are doing right, you know to properly monetize the World Cup, and I think you know the recent \u2013 I guess, shall we say the last four to eight years, we have not had sort of an equivalent amount of growth in FIFA around the World Cup. So I'm just wondering if there are some learnings or best practices that you can export out of Korea and China into the western world \u2013 the World Cup. Thanks.\nLaura Miele : Hi Stephen! This is Laura. I'm going to take the Glu mobile question. As Andrew framed earlier, we still perceive the mobile market to be significant. It's a $100 billion. It's where Gen Z and Gen Alpha play. It's the platforms they prefer. It's also a significant platform in growth geographies around the world where we are looking to expand our franchises, so incredibly important market.  And as it relates to Glu, we see the genres and markets in the shooter category, the sports category, the casual creation category where females primarily play. So \u2013 and of course the Glu content fits very well into these genres and these categories in the mobile market that are still growing and where we still see a strong connection.  Glu is fully integrated into EA and EA\u2019s mobile teams now, and so as we think about our future of Sims, we of course consider Cabot Fashion Design Home as part of that ecosystem as Andrew has referenced. We think about tapped sports and the potential that we have globally around our sports business. Those are a meaningful part of our growth there. And we also have had some strong talent, some good tech have been integrated into our overall EA mobile business.  So the integration and the transition has happened, and we really consider and look at the mobile business within EA in a very whole way. \nAndrew Wilson: And then as we think about FIFA broadly, and more importantly as we think about FC and you think about the growth in that business. I think we should think about it on three vectors. The first vector of course is World Cup, and certainly we saw very strong growth in our business coincided with the World Cup.  The good news about the World Cup, and we've been tracking this for many World Cups as you might imagine, is it's not a moment in time. It actually establishes new fans and brings more people to football. And while we had some incredible matches during this World Cup and we saw, you know incredible final that pitted Messy versus Mbappe, you know what that does is establish a whole new set of fans for football on a go forward basis. And so while certainly World Cup was a boost for us, we expected that will create an ongoing benefit over the course of time.  The second part of the growth though, it wasn't just about World Cup. It was the incredible titles that our teams launched, and certainly with what we did in the core FIFA franchise was our biggest and most innovative FIFA yet, with all that we did in and around FIFA Mobile, which was up triple digits, and all the new event content we put into FIFA online and how we really tied that community together into a global football ecosystem, you know interwoven into the fabric of football fandom, that's a really important part of growth.  And what we're seeing now is that we have fans coming into the experience, not just about experiencing one event or one team or one league, but fans coming to experience really to share their love and passion for football with their fans, and really to put it on the line against their rivals. And so as we think about what the teams have been able to do, we expect that that will continue to drive more growth for us over time.  The third one is football more broadly, and if you really track what's going on in the world, football in every part of the world is growing. It was growing before the World Cup, and it's certainly growing post the World Cup. Premier league, La Liga, League One, MLS, all these leagues are growing in popularity globally, and if you look at what happened for us, we nearly doubled our units in North America FIFA. That represents a significant opportunity for us in this incredibly sports hungry market.  And so if you take those three things and then you roll that into EA Sports FC that we will launch later this year, where we have significantly more control over the nature of the experience and the things that we can do for fans, we can work more closely together with our partners at a league level, at a team level, at a player level. We think that well beyond this World Cup and certainly through many World Cups to come, the growth in football for us represents an extraordinary opportunity. \nStephen Ju : Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nOmar Dessouky : Hey guys! How are you doing? In the past you've given high level assumptions as to your expectations for the growth of the PC and console videogame software market, and I was wondering if you have assumptions for 2023 as to how much they might grow? \nA - Andrew Wilson: I don't know that we have given direct assumptions on those markets in time. We may have represented some market data that had been shared with us over time. We don't have anything to share specifically at this moment, other than what I would say is what we're hearing from our partners, particularly in console, is that a lot of the constraints around their ability to get product to market is pretty much behind us, and that we should expect a fairly strong console supply in the coming quarter and the quarters through the rest of this year.  So that represents a great opportunity for us. We don't yet know how to quantify that. We know that we've been selling into what has been a relatively constrained console market. The demand is incredibly high. The good news for us as we continue to launch quality software and you combine that with what we believe, we\u2019ll be unconstrained supply of consoles. We think that positions us well in the coming year with respect to our core HD market. \nOmar Dessouky : Okay, thank you. And for Chris, so if I just look at the full year guide of around maybe midpoint about $7.1 billion and about $7.750 billion, which is the guide you guys gave last quarter, I see a difference of 650. If I were to subtract this quarter you know versus your guide and you know I would get about $500,000 or $1 million of push out. You know that \u2013 and of course the Apex Legend. So if I subtract 130 for the under performance in the quarter, and then let's say 20 or so for under performance or cancellation of Apex Legends or sun setting of Apex Legends, I get about $500 million left and obviously that $500 million subtraction is not entirely Star Wars.  So I was wondering if you could break that down for us. So how much of that roughly $500 million that I'm seeing is Star Wars versus FX impact versus the PC console titles that you think might be softer in Q4. And especially on FX, it looks like the British Pound and the Euro are up about 10 points versus when you guided in November, which would suggest that FX impacts should have been positive. Thanks. \nChris Suh: Okay, got it. I think I followed all your numbers Omar, so let me see if I could help. So I think directionally if I followed your math, your math is sort of futs, if I could put it that way. The drivers for Q4 and consequently for the full year are in fact the exact drivers that I talked about previously, which is first and foremost the shift of Jedi from Q4 and into Q1 of FY \u201924, that's the most significant impact on the Q4 number.  Secondly, as you pointed out, the performance in Q3 relative to our guidance, that's the next one. And then by extension of that which Andrew asked as well earlier, which was what did we take in terms of learnings from Q3 and how are we applying the current macro environment and the current market conditions against what we know to be high quality launches in Q4, and that\u2019s part of the equation as well into Q4. And then the fourth one as you pointed out is the sun setting of Apex Mobile. So those are the four primary \u2013 I think you have the four primary drivers and that equates the revision in the guidance in Q4. \nOmar Dessouky : Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nBenjamin Soff : Hey! Thanks guys. I was wondering if we could dig a little bit deeper into the trends that you're seeing in Apex. And within that context, what's your view on whether or not the industry is getting more competitive as a whole, in addition to the macro environment getting a little bit weaker. And then I just wanted to see what you guys thought about, you know whether or not this is a franchise we should expect to continue to grow in the future, you know given your early color for fiscal \u201924. Thanks. \nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, so I think that you know as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Apex is traditionally a little quieter in Q3 as the live service ebbs and flows with a launch slate of new titles around the holiday. I think this was a very strong launch holiday slate, including you know FIFA which performed very well during a World Cup, and certainly there were some competitive titles that were very strong \u2013 that had been very weak in prior years quite frankly. And so there was probably a little built up demand around some of those competitive titles.  And so, while you know the franchise still performed incredibly well, just not quite as well as we had expected based on our projection of where the competitive landscape would be. And we're already starting to see a resurgence of engagement in the franchise, which is again typical of Apex, and we're coming up to a four year anniversary, and we've got a season launch update coming, and we feel very, very good about where the franchise is going. I believe the franchise will continue to grow. We've got a lot of new things that we can do. While mobile isn't going to be the growth vector today, it will be a growth vector in the future. There's new geographic expansion that we will go to. There will be modalities of play, that the team will \u2013 you know additional modalities of play that the team will investigate over the course of time.  As we've always said, we think about this as at least a 10 year franchise. We're just coming up to the fourth anniversary. It's an incredibly successful franchise. Our community is very dedicated to it, very highly engaged. Our expectation is that we\u2019ll have a strong quarter, but we're also being very deliberate around how we planned for the quarter, given what we've just seen in Q3 around the macro. \nBenjamin Soff : Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon, and thanks for the question. So you still have a very deep development pipeline going on. So I'm curious, with the cost cuts that you've made, are these temporary cost cuts, are they permanent cost cuts. And as I think about what you said about an early read for next year, sort of mid-single digit revenue and bottom line growth. Does that mean with these cost cuts, maybe you can get to a flat operating margin year-over-year. \nChris Suh: Hey Eric! This is Chris. I'll sort of take your questions I think together in \u2013 I think it sort of thematically hits on similar things. So let me just talk about sort of our approach to what we've talked about on the call, which is really focusing our investments into our best long term growth opportunities.  I think what you see, that we did in Q3 and Q4, as well as the inferences of what we're going to continue to do in \u201924 is a reflection of us continuing to be very disciplined about how we view and really prioritize how we view our growth opportunities.  And so they don't \u2013 you know we've been very deliberate and very careful to continue and invest in those things that will bring long term growth and really being very disciplined about the pace of hiring and some of the variable spend that applied to our \u2013 you know given the business that we see in the second half of the year.  As we look forward into \u201924, I think again, just doing the math on the early guide that I gave, if we're able to achieve the guidance or the preliminary direction that I gave to a mid-single digit top line with a better than that improvement on operating line, it would be margin improvement year-on-year in \u201924 versus \u201923 for sure. \nEric Handler: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. \nMike Hickey : Hey Andrew, Chris, Laura! Thanks guys for taking my questions. Just two from me. Thanks for the early look on your fiscal \u201924 growth opportunity. Just curious if you could speak to sort of the degree perhaps and the longevity of the macro pressure you're seeing on your players, if you think it's going to get worse before it getter better or how you think about the potential for a recession in job losses, and how that plays into your \u201924 guidance, the early look that you gave us.  And then the second question, obviously you didn\u2019t give the number, but I think the FIFA license was rumored to be around $150 million annually. Curious if all that money has been spent as you sort of budget \u201924 in terms of right fees with the other partners and maybe incremental marketing spend. Or if you think there's some cushion there, in your forward fiscal in terms of potential savings. Thanks, guys. \nChris Suh: Yeah, I could certainly take that one. As we talked about, we're operating in a time when there's greater uncertainty and greater unpredictability in the market. And we saw that in Q3. As we look forward into FY\u201924 I would say that the early direction we gave assumes really based on the best information we have now, which is you know we're not in the business of forecasting markets or GDP or macro, but we do know the trends that we see now that we executed Q3 with and that we are seeing entering Q4.  And so I would say that the best way to think about FY\u201924 is that the underlying market assumptions that are neither material improvement nor material worsening in that macro environment that we're operating in. And then obviously, as we continue to go on and get closer to the quarters, we'll have more certainty with the out quarters that we are looking at.  In terms of the FIFA math associated with the license fees, you know the way that I would encourage you to think about it is that, in FY \u201924, it's such an important transition year for what is, our biggest franchise, and our focus is really about making sure that we build the greatest experience in terms of bringing the players along with us in the journey. It never has been solely about the profit margins associated with this transition, and so we are completely focused on making the transition in the launch of EA SPORTS FC a really fantastic experience for players. \nAndrew Wilson: The one piece I would add to that around that, and concur with Chris, it's not so much about what did we pay fee for or what won't we pay fee for the future. I think that we will invest meaningfully into the franchise to grow it through this phase. Again, we have really said this is not just about a change of the sign on the front of the game, but a real sign of change in terms of what we offer the players over time. And we do believe that we can offer a bigger, more comprehensive, more immersive global football fan experience within our games and beyond the bounds of our games, working with our great partners around the world.  And as we think about investing in that in \u201924 and maybe even deeply in \u201925, we believe it will pay meaningful dividends over the course of time. This is a franchise that we've been investing in for 30 years. I couldn't be more excited about the next 30 years of the franchise, and what we'll be able to do. And so I think our focus right now is really how do we set ourselves up to realize the fullness of the potential of developing the preeminent interactive football fan community in the world. \nChris Evenden : We\u2019ll take the next question please. \nOperator: Your next question, you will come from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Cost: Hi everyone! Thanks taking the questions. Just on some of the commentary about mobile, you've talked about some challenges in the mobile game industry and some macro headwinds. I guess you know at this point we're a fair bit of the way, maybe a year into weakness in the mobile market. Are you seeing a real differentiation in terms of the stickiness and the predictability of your players on the PC and council side versus mobile, that's question one.  And then the second one is just, can you quantify the guidance impact of delaying Star Wars into the next fiscal year? Thanks.\nLaura Miele : Hi Matt! On the mobile sickness as you said, we measured certainly by engagement. And I would say it varies across the mobile experiences we have. As we've discussed our strategy and how we are thinking about the future, it\u2019s really around how the mobile platform can contribute to the overall connected ecosystems of franchises and what we're seeing, as in Andrew mentioned, as players play on the go, as Gen Z and Gen Alpha market, you know addressable market expands as every year goes by, it\u2019s going to be very important for us to show up on the right platforms for the right moments and right experiences.  So we're seeing in some of our, as we discussed on FIFA Mobile is we've had we have significant engagement and significant acquisitions into this franchise, because of the mobile game that we have. And that's how we're really looking at the incredible assets that we have around casual creator games for our Sims products, our sports games and really dial that up to connect into the ecosystems, because they can be a meaningful contributor of new players, engagement and connection into a high def experience. \nAndrew Wilson : Great! And Matt, let me jump in on the question about the guidance. So as we talked about in some form in some of the other questions, the move of Jedi to Q1 is the most material driver of the Q4 guidance revision, And it\u2019s a significant part of the full year revision as well, depending on which wins that you're taking a looking at the at the guidance numbers.  Again, just again reiterating that from a lifetime economic standpoint, the move to Q1 is better for the overall game, the ecosystem and for the brand, and again importantly, given the timing of the original launch in March versus now in April, it doesn't change our cash flow forecast for Q4 nor for FY\u201924. \nMatthew Cost: Great! Thank you. \nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of David Karnovsky with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nDavid Karnovsky : Hey! Thank you for fitting me in. Chris, you noted your forward view is based on trends currently or where you exit in Q3, but wondering if maybe you could speak just to the phasing of kind of the economic impact through the fiscal third quarter. Did you see player engagement or monetization kind of change at all? Was there anything specific to call on the holiday period. And they're just given the news around Apex and Battlefield, any update on Lord of the Rings, that you still plan to launch this game, you know anything you could say around the soft launch? Thank you. \nAndrew Wilson: Great, okay, and I'll start and then turn it over to Laura to talk about Lord of the Rings. The shape of the quarter, and I think you know, in some of the materials, we talked about how uncertainty mounted throughout the course of the quarter, and I think that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s probably a good reflection of what we saw, and it is a quarter where the results were mixed. Where we were continuing to watch the strength in FIFA, the strength and FIFA that occurred throughout the quarter, and in particular at the end of the quarter. And then we were also watching the performance of these high quality titles, and how they launch in the market reception to that and both from a player, and a reviewer, as well as a monetization standpoint.  So I'd say we were, understanding, absorbing and analyzing you know different data points throughout the course of the quarter. But as I talked about, in particular the things that led to the our performance in Q3 and the extension of that into Q4 were specifically related to high quality launches and the pattern I would say of recognition of what we would expect in terms of return, versus launches of that caliber, and that was very specific to the titles that launched on those dates in the quarter, as well as just the macro, I would say market gravity that we saw across smaller titles throughout the quarter. \nLaura Miele : Hi David! To answer your question about Lord of the Rings Mobile. As a reminder, this is a team that created Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, which has been one of our most successful mobile games, and we're over $1 billion in net bookings on that. They are currently actively working on Lord of the Rings and soft launch currently and so we expect a full launch on that mobile game this coming year. \nAndrew Wilson: Okay. So thank you all for joining us for this quarter. We appreciate the support. We appreciate the good questions and the engagement today, and we'll speak to you next quarter. \nOperator: That will conclude today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

It's where Gen Z and Gen Alpha play. It's the platforms they prefer. It's also a significant platform in growth geographies around the world where we are looking to expand our franchises, so incredibly important market.  And as it relates to Glu, we see the genres and markets in the shooter category, the sports category, the casual creation category where females primarily play. So \u2013 and of course the Glu content fits very well into these genres and these categories in the mobile market that are still growing and where we still see a strong connection.  Glu is fully integrated into EA and EA's mobile teams now, and so as we think about our future of Sims, we of course consider Cabot Fashion Design Home as part of that ecosystem as Andrew has referenced. We think about tapped sports and the potential that we have globally around our sports business. Those are a meaningful part of our growth there.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Chris Suh",
            "content": "Thank you. As Andrew shared, we delivered strong engagement and high-quality titles again in Q3. Nevertheless, our results were mixed relative to our expectations. Based on Q2 trends and leading indicators, we had built our Q3 guidance on four key underlying assumptions: First, that our player network would continue to expand, and engagement metrics remain healthy. Second, we would see strong momentum for FIFA, our global football franchise. Third, that we would release high-quality new games into the market; and finally, that Apex would experience its typical seasonal low in Q3. While these assumptions were directionally correct, net bookings came in short of our expectations. We achieved new highs in our player network, sustained healthy engagement trends, and delivered a record quarter for the entire EA SPORTS FIFA franchise. However, the performance of new games, despite strong reviews, and of the Apex franchise, was below the levels we had anticipated, reflecting the challenging market dynamics.  Recognizing the softer net bookings trend, we proactively took focused measures during the quarter to reduce our costs and lessen the impact on our underlying profitability. Now let's go through the quarter in more detail. Net bookings for the third quarter were $2.3 billion, down 9% or 5% in constant currency, driven largely by a tough comp as we lap the launch of Battlefield 2042 and by Apex performance, partially offset by strength across the entire FIFA ecosystem and the launch of \u2018Need for Speed Unbound.' Madden 23 was level with a very strong quarter last year. Our life services net bookings were down 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Growth at constant currency was driven by strength in FIFA, with rapid growth occurring in FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 75% of our business. We delivered Q3 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year.  Operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis, driven by lower marketing spend as we lap the Battlefield 2042 launch. Further, we reduced costs by just over $60 million by moderating our hiring and prioritizing our variable spend in the quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion and we returned $377 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, moving to guidance. As we navigate an uncertain market, I'd like to share more context about how we set our Q4 guidance. First and most important, we expect we will continue to execute well on the two most important drivers of our long-term success and growth: strong player engagement and the production of high-quality games, like the just-released and well-reviewed Dead Space.  Second, we are confident that EA SPORTS FIFA will sustain and build on the strong momentum that we exited Q3 with. And third, based on our Q3 launch results, we're taking a more measured approach for the highly anticipated Q4 launches. Next, we are committed to operational excellence and being disciplined in our investment decisions. The actions we've taken during Q3 will reduce our total H2 operating expenses by approximately $140 million. In addition, we will continue to work to prioritize, spend broadly, evaluate our real estate footprint, and focus our investments on our best long-term growth opportunities. And finally, our Q4 guidance reflects the player-first decision to shift the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to Q1-FY24. It's important to note that while it changes the timing of reported net bookings, it does not change the overall lifetime economics, nor our expectations around free cash flow for Q4 or FY24. Now, on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are revising our Q4 net bookings guidance to $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion, which reflects the shift of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to Q1, our decision to sunset Apex Mobile and updated expectations based on Q3 trends, in particular for launches happening in the quarter. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.  We expect operating expenses to be $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion for the quarter, approximately $80 million lower than our previous expectation, reflecting our ongoing efforts to prioritize and focus our investment. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.05 to $0.20 for the fourth quarter. This Q4 guidance results in fiscal year net bookings of $7.07 billion to $7.17 billion. We are also revising our guidance for operating cash flow as a result of the updated net bookings guidance to $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that results in free cash flow of about $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. For further details on our fiscal 2023 guidance, including our GAAP guidance, please see our press release. Before handing it back to Andrew, I'd like to provide a few early thoughts on our fiscal 2024. As we look to next year, we see the main drivers of our business being our durable broad portfolio of live services. Our newly rebranded EA SPORTS FC franchise, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, plus additional titles we will announce in due course.  Excluding the impact of FX, we expect mid-single digit growth on net bookings and low double-digit growth on underlying profitability. If rates remain unchanged from today, that would equate to mid-single digit growth for both top and bottom line. Our business is anchored by incredible brands, evergreen live services, high quality games, and a growing player network. We will be focused on our investments as we build and scale our business, all while delivering amazing experiences for our players. Now, I'll hand the call back to Andrew. Sure. Hi Andrew! This is Chris. I could take this one. So in my prepared commentaries I talked about what we saw in Q3 and the specific trend I point to is the fact that we talked about strong player engagement and high quality titles. But I also talked about the fact that the highly rated titles didn't perform to the level that we would expect it based on historical expectations for a title of that caliber.  And so we're taking some of those learnings, and I do think that you know when we look at all the data and we analyze what we saw in terms of demand and results, we do believe that that's a reflection of the overall market conditions that we saw continued to mount throughout the quarter, and we've taken those learnings and we applied those into the Q4 guidance. Okay, got it. I think I followed all your numbers Omar, so let me see if I could help. So I think directionally if I followed your math, your math is sort of futs, if I could put it that way. The drivers for Q4 and consequently for the full year are in fact the exact drivers that I talked about previously, which is first and foremost the shift of Jedi from Q4 and into Q1 of FY '24, that's the most significant impact on the Q4 number.  Secondly, as you pointed out, the performance in Q3 relative to our guidance, that's the next one. And then by extension of that which Andrew asked as well earlier, which was what did we take in terms of learnings from Q3 and how are we applying the current macro environment and the current market conditions against what we know to be high quality launches in Q4, and that's part of the equation as well into Q4. And then the fourth one as you pointed out is the sun setting of Apex Mobile. So those are the four primary \u2013 I think you have the four primary drivers and that equates the revision in the guidance in Q4. Hey Eric! This is Chris. I'll sort of take your questions I think together in \u2013 I think it sort of thematically hits on similar things. So let me just talk about sort of our approach to what we've talked about on the call, which is really focusing our investments into our best long term growth opportunities.  I think what you see, that we did in Q3 and Q4, as well as the inferences of what we're going to continue to do in '24 is a reflection of us continuing to be very disciplined about how we view and really prioritize how we view our growth opportunities.  And so they don't \u2013 you know we've been very deliberate and very careful to continue and invest in those things that will bring long term growth and really being very disciplined about the pace of hiring and some of the variable spend that applied to our \u2013 you know given the business that we see in the second half of the year.  As we look forward into '24, I think again, just doing the math on the early guide that I gave, if we're able to achieve the guidance or the preliminary direction that I gave to a mid-single digit top line with a better than that improvement on operating line, it would be margin improvement year-on-year in '24 versus '23 for sure. Yeah, I could certainly take that one. As we talked about, we're operating in a time when there's greater uncertainty and greater unpredictability in the market. And we saw that in Q3. As we look forward into FY'24 I would say that the early direction we gave assumes really based on the best information we have now, which is you know we're not in the business of forecasting markets or GDP or macro, but we do know the trends that we see now that we executed Q3 with and that we are seeing entering Q4.  And so I would say that the best way to think about FY'24 is that the underlying market assumptions that are neither material improvement nor material worsening in that macro environment that we're operating in. And then obviously, as we continue to go on and get closer to the quarters, we'll have more certainty with the out quarters that we are looking at.  In terms of the FIFA math associated with the license fees, you know the way that I would encourage you to think about it is that, in FY '24, it's such an important transition year for what is, our biggest franchise, and our focus is really about making sure that we build the greatest experience in terms of bringing the players along with us in the journey. It never has been solely about the profit margins associated with this transition, and so we are completely focused on making the transition in the launch of EA SPORTS FC a really fantastic experience for players."

            "content": "Thanks Chris. During Q3, EA entertained hundreds of millions of fans through our games and multi-platform live services. Our teams delivered high quality experiences reaching global communities, providing 128 content updates across 36 titles. We launched two new AAA releases: NHL 23 in October, and Need for Speed Unbound in December, both earning strong reception and positive reviews. The just-released Dead Space has also earned high praise from fans and critics alike, being dubbed \u201ca new benchmark for remakes\u201d and even \u201cone of the best games of all time.\u201d We drove record engagement during the quarter on some of our biggest franchises, even surpassing historical highs delivered over the last several years. Our player network also continues to grow, now over 650 million. While we delivered for our players and engagement was strong in the quarter, the macro environment remained challenging and impacted Q3 results.  During the quarter we took measured action to reduce our expenses, and we continue to exercise cost discipline, further focusing our investments in key areas of growth. As we navigate the short-term, we remain focused on what fuels our business: delivering high quality entertainment and driving strong engagement across our global network. The passion and enthusiasm for interactive entertainment continues to grow. For more and more people around the world, games are a cherished and authentic way to stay connected with the people they care about, build community, and find joy through shared experiences. Across all of entertainment, people are diving deeper and engaging further with their favorite franchises. EA SPORTS FIFA is at the heart of global football culture, and once again we delivered strong engagement in Q3 across our entire ecosystem.  Year-to-date net bookings from our FIFA franchise has grown 4% or 15% at constant currency. FIFA 23 is pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history, delivering record engagement in Q3. In North America alone unit sales are up over 50% year-over-year. FIFA Mobile engagement was up triple digits in Q3, and FIFA Online in Asia is hitting the highest monthly active users in years. This engagement fueled strong financial performance. We have incredible momentum in our global football ecosystem. For 30 years we've been leaders in interactive football and collaborated with the most extensive network of partners spanning the globe. Our games are interwoven with the fabric of football fandom, averaging 300 million hours of gameplay every month. We are unbelievably excited to take this energy into the future with our EA SPORTS FC brand, where we'll deliver even more for fans as part of an expanding experience with endless ways to play, watch, create and connect through their love of football. Madden NFL is the world's preeminent interactive American football experience and one of the most powerful franchises in sports. We continue to invest in innovation to drive engagement and growth across this mega-franchise. Madden NFL 23 had a solid holiday quarter driven by Ultimate Team, and Madden NFL Mobile launched a new season and multiple in-game events further powering engagement. With big moments ahead, like Super Bowl LVII and Team of The Year, Madden NFL will continue to entertain millions of fans. Our EA SPORTS & Racing teams are the best in the business. The convergence of sport and entertainment is picking up pace. Through our investments in technology and new experiences, we will continue to push the boundaries and blur the lines between the digital and physical by empowering players to come together, express their fandom, and build online communities, both in and around our games. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world, with mega-franchises like Apex Legends and The Sims. Apex Legends has historically had a quieter Q3 as the live service model ebbs and flows against a seasonally crowded launch slate this time of the year.  Moving into Q4, we're already seeing a rise in engagement as we approach the game's four-year anniversary and the launch of a new season, bringing highly anticipated updates and fresh content. Apex is one of the few IPs in its genre with proven endurance to engage and re-engage players as they play, watch, and compete. The Sims is also evolving and growing as a live service. In Q3 we took the base game free to enter and welcomed over 10 million new players into the community, driving strong engagement. Our teams are gearing up to add more collaborative ways to further empower our community to unleash their imaginations. We have incredible opportunities ahead. To do more extraordinary things in service of our players and our people, we are making deliberate decisions and reallocating investments to prioritize our biggest growth areas, building global online communities around our biggest franchises, telling incredible interactive stories, and harnessing the power of our social ecosystem to create meaningful connections. Our teams are deeply committed to delivering incredible experiences for our players. As part of this commitment, we have made the player-first decision to move Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's launch date to April 28. The game is a creative and innovative leap forward, going further into the experience of a Jedi, delivering more content, more exploration, and more fun.  Anticipation for the game is incredibly high and the Respawn team known around the world for delivering top quality entertainment is focusing on the final polish stage to enhance performance, stability, and most importantly, the player experience. Giving the team these extra few weeks to deliver the best experience for our players will not only result in a higher quality game, but puts us in a best position to grow the long-term value of the franchise. We're also making strategic decisions around two mobile titles. Apex Legends Mobile won game of the year on both iPhone and Android. Despite this strong start, the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations of our players. After months of working with our development partner, we have made the mutual decision to sunset this version of the game. We've learned a great deal and have plans to reimagine a connected Apex mobile experience in the future. It is through these learnings, combined with a clear franchise strategy, that we've also made the decision to stop the development of the current Battlefield mobile title. We know our community values a deeply connected ecosystem and our team is focused on delivering the best, unified cross-platform experience for our players. Everything we do is designed to inspire the world to play. As a company, our teams have demonstrated that with a culture of creativity, innovation and resilience, we can grow through transformative periods of change and lead the future of entertainment. As we look ahead, our teams remain focused and disciplined as we reshape our investments toward a future of accelerated content generation, increased direct player engagement and deeply connected ecosystems to bring more people into our global community. We are taking strategic actions to evaluate our cost structure as we navigate through the current macro environment.  With our exceptional talent, our broad portfolio of amazing IP, and massive player network, we remain committed to delivering long-term value in our business. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Thanks, Chris. We drove incredible engagement and delivered high quality experiences in the quarter. As Chris shared, we are being disciplined and focused on what we can control to fuel our biggest growth opportunities. We are confident in our vision for the future, and with our exceptional talent, proven IP, and growing player network, EA is operating from a position of strength. Our audiences have an insatiable appetite for interactive entertainment and are engaging more deeply with the experiences they love. The future of entertainment is interactive, and no team is better equipped than EA to deliver amazing games and content to inspire the world to play. Now, Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Regina, we are ready for questions now. Yeah, great question, and I do believe we've learned a great deal as we've gone through this. Certainly, this game was in development for a long period of time as the expectation for the size and scale and complexity of mobile games continues to grow as the platform continues to mature over time.  As we look at it, we really kind of compartmentalize into a few key categories. First, as you point out, this was a really good game built by really good teams, and it won game of year on both Apple and Android devices, which is an extraordinary achievement given the amount of games that are made.  But a couple of things also were true inside of that: One is, there is a level of immersion and complexity to Apex Game Play in particular, which is very much about what Apex is about, verticality of game play and team based play that didn't translate quite as well to mobile devices as we had hoped. I think we've learned a great deal from that.  Second is, the game while it really engaged the core deeply, and it actually attracted a lot of new users, which we think speaks volumes for the future success potential of the franchise, it didn't retain the more casual user at the rate that we needed it to, and in a game that relies a lot on team play and competitive play, liquidity of the overall player base is really, really important as you think about the future experience of players over time.  And then third, I think the mobile market continues to be challenging, and we certainly saw \u2013 you know we launched into what was a soft mobile market, and with some changing and evolving kind of player personalities as we move through.  So as we think about this on a go forward basis, we take those learnings and we apply the real strengths, which is we know Apex has incredible demand from both the core users and new more casual users. We know that we have the underlying ingredients to make an incredible game. We need to be thoughtful about the nature of the core game mechanics and the retention mechanics that we build into the game over time, and most importantly, as we look at the mobile market, the biggest new launches that are seeing the most success are the ones that are deeply connected to the broader franchise, where there's not always cross play, but it's certainly cross progression and a feeling that they are part of a single unified community and a single unified game experience.  And so as we think about that for the future, that will be very, very important as we reimagine Apex Mobile. And certainly as we had those learning from Apex Mobile and we were developing into Battlefield Mobile, we anticipated that while Battlefield had also been in development for some time and was making good progress, given the construct of that game, it also was probably going to run with some of the same challenges, and rather than continue to push against that, we wanted to come back, take a breath, reset and really think about the broader franchise strategy and allow the leadership to build a true cross platform immersive game experience around a reimagined battlefield in the future.  Both of these things represent strong learning opportunities for us, and both of these things represent an ability for us as a company to lean into two great franchises in a way that the mobile market is more aligned to for the future. Okay, that is two solid questions. Let me start and then maybe Chris and Laura can provide some color as we get in. First off on mobile, I think a few things that we start with, and certainly I think that we, you know we think through on a daily basis, which is while the mobile market continues to be a very challenging market to find success in, it also continues to be the world's largest gaming platform and certainly has the ability to attract more plays than any other platform. And so for us it will always be a very important part of our go forward franchise strategy.  When we think about mobile broadly, we really think about the titles fitting into two key categories. The first category is what you speak to in the connective sports, but it's also true for Sims and Apex and Battlefield, and will be true for Skate, which is how is it part of a broader cross platform global community of play, and how do we unite and unify global communities of players around their core IP regardless of where they play on PC, mobile or console.  This for us represents probably our strongest opportunity in mobile and certainly where you'll see us begin to really invest. When you look at what's been happening with FIFI up triple digits, it's really as we've started to bring the mobile title closer to the core franchise and start to operate it as a singular business with a unified play community around the world. It's how we're building for Skate, it's how we're going to build for the future of the Sims, and with these decisions around Apex and Battlefield, it's also how we'll build for those franchises.  That represents an extraordinary opportunity for us to attract a much bigger global community to our biggest IP. It represents an opportunity to grow monetization on the mobile platform, but it also represents an opportunity to provide alternative ways for our existing core audiences who plan console and PC, to play when they are away from those core devices they have. And as we look at the mobile market on a go forward basis, we think that that will be where we'll find real strength for that part of our business. The other part is, the stand alone mobile native titles, and we have a number of titles that continue to perform exceptionally well. Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, The Sims, some of the titles that we got as part of our Glu acquisition, Golf Clash. We'll continue to invest in those as well, but you should expect that as we think about the future, we're going to really lay our investment into our bigger franchise play. We will continue to drive the long term value of our existing standalone mobile titles and will probably invest less in new startup standalone titles, just because we think that's probably not where we will find strength in the industry over time.  To hit your second part around title launches, and certainly I think we're hearing more about that across the industry, and I just, I'd separate what you are hearing from us with everything that you're hearing around the industry broadly. While it might be \u2013 it might make sense to kind of draw a broader narrative, I think for us as we look at it, we launched a number of titles in Q3 and Q4 certainly with Dead Space and Need For Speed and NHL some of our smaller titles, and FIFA and Madden, we've launched an incredible amount of titles on time and at tremendous high quality.  I think what we saw with Jedi, was this is an incredibly large game. It's you know both, immersive and creative and innovative, and the team just have come down the home stretch and really want to get to quality. And when we think about quality, quality is really a combination of three things: Innovation, Creativity and Polish. And that last element Polish, the removal of bugs and the removal of potential play frustrations is as important as the innovation and the creativity itself.  And so as we look at our future, we feel that we've been executing extremely well till this point, around the titles and the title updates that we've been launching. We also feel incredibly bullish and positive around the trajectory of Jedi. And when the team came and sat down and said, \u2018Hey, if you let us have just a few more weeks, we think we can deliver even higher quality.'  We really wanted to get behind and support them. After all, this is an incredible team with the first iteration of the franchise that they launched. They broke all kinds of records. They are deeply committed to the franchise, deeply committed to our partners at Disney and deeply committed to our players, and we really wanted to get behind them and support it, especially as it will not impact the overall health of the franchise. In fact, it will not only last with a better quality, but almost certainly increase the lifetime value of the franchise over time. And then as we think about FIFA broadly, and more importantly as we think about FC and you think about the growth in that business. I think we should think about it on three vectors. The first vector of course is World Cup, and certainly we saw very strong growth in our business coincided with the World Cup.  The good news about the World Cup, and we've been tracking this for many World Cups as you might imagine, is it's not a moment in time. It actually establishes new fans and brings more people to football. And while we had some incredible matches during this World Cup and we saw, you know incredible final that pitted Messy versus Mbappe, you know what that does is establish a whole new set of fans for football on a go forward basis. And so while certainly World Cup was a boost for us, we expected that will create an ongoing benefit over the course of time.  The second part of the growth though, it wasn't just about World Cup. It was the incredible titles that our teams launched, and certainly with what we did in the core FIFA franchise was our biggest and most innovative FIFA yet, with all that we did in and around FIFA Mobile, which was up triple digits, and all the new event content we put into FIFA online and how we really tied that community together into a global football ecosystem, you know interwoven into the fabric of football fandom, that's a really important part of growth.  And what we're seeing now is that we have fans coming into the experience, not just about experiencing one event or one team or one league, but fans coming to experience really to share their love and passion for football with their fans, and really to put it on the line against their rivals. And so as we think about what the teams have been able to do, we expect that that will continue to drive more growth for us over time.  The third one is football more broadly, and if you really track what's going on in the world, football in every part of the world is growing. It was growing before the World Cup, and it's certainly growing post the World Cup. Premier league, La Liga, League One, MLS, all these leagues are growing in popularity globally, and if you look at what happened for us, we nearly doubled our units in North America FIFA. That represents a significant opportunity for us in this incredibly sports hungry market.  And so if you take those three things and then you roll that into EA Sports FC that we will launch later this year, where we have significantly more control over the nature of the experience and the things that we can do for fans, we can work more closely together with our partners at a league level, at a team level, at a player level. We think that well beyond this World Cup and certainly through many World Cups to come, the growth in football for us represents an extraordinary opportunity. Yeah, so I think that you know as we talked about in the prepared remarks, Apex is traditionally a little quieter in Q3 as the live service ebbs and flows with a launch slate of new titles around the holiday. I think this was a very strong launch holiday slate, including you know FIFA which performed very well during a World Cup, and certainly there were some competitive titles that were very strong \u2013 that had been very weak in prior years quite frankly. And so there was probably a little built up demand around some of those competitive titles.  And so, while you know the franchise still performed incredibly well, just not quite as well as we had expected based on our projection of where the competitive landscape would be. And we're already starting to see a resurgence of engagement in the franchise, which is again typical of Apex, and we're coming up to a four year anniversary, and we've got a season launch update coming, and we feel very, very good about where the franchise is going. I believe the franchise will continue to grow. We've got a lot of new things that we can do. While mobile isn't going to be the growth vector today, it will be a growth vector in the future. There's new geographic expansion that we will go to. There will be modalities of play, that the team will \u2013 you know additional modalities of play that the team will investigate over the course of time.  As we've always said, we think about this as at least a 10 year franchise. We're just coming up to the fourth anniversary. It's an incredibly successful franchise. Our community is very dedicated to it, very highly engaged. Our expectation is that we'll have a strong quarter, but we're also being very deliberate around how we planned for the quarter, given what we've just seen in Q3 around the macro. The one piece I would add to that around that, and concur with Chris, it's not so much about what did we pay fee for or what won't we pay fee for the future. I think that we will invest meaningfully into the franchise to grow it through this phase. Again, we have really said this is not just about a change of the sign on the front of the game, but a real sign of change in terms of what we offer the players over time. And we do believe that we can offer a bigger, more comprehensive, more immersive global football fan experience within our games and beyond the bounds of our games, working with our great partners around the world.  And as we think about investing in that in '24 and maybe even deeply in '25, we believe it will pay meaningful dividends over the course of time. This is a franchise that we've been investing in for 30 years. I couldn't be more excited about the next 30 years of the franchise, and what we'll be able to do. And so I think our focus right now is really how do we set ourselves up to realize the fullness of the potential of developing the preeminent interactive football fan community in the world. Great! And Matt, let me jump in on the question about the guidance. So as we talked about in some form in some of the other questions, the move of Jedi to Q1 is the most material driver of the Q4 guidance revision, And it's a significant part of the full year revision as well, depending on which wins that you're taking a looking at the at the guidance numbers.  Again, just again reiterating that from a lifetime economic standpoint, the move to Q1 is better for the overall game, the ecosystem and for the brand, and again importantly, given the timing of the original launch in March versus now in April, it doesn't change our cash flow forecast for Q4 nor for FY'24. Great, okay, and I'll start and then turn it over to Laura to talk about Lord of the Rings. The shape of the quarter, and I think you know, in some of the materials, we talked about how uncertainty mounted throughout the course of the quarter, and I think that's a \u2013 that's probably a good reflection of what we saw, and it is a quarter where the results were mixed. Where we were continuing to watch the strength in FIFA, the strength and FIFA that occurred throughout the quarter, and in particular at the end of the quarter. And then we were also watching the performance of these high quality titles, and how they launch in the market reception to that and both from a player, and a reviewer, as well as a monetization standpoint.  So I'd say we were, understanding, absorbing and analyzing you know different data points throughout the course of the quarter. But as I talked about, in particular the things that led to the our performance in Q3 and the extension of that into Q4 were specifically related to high quality launches and the pattern I would say of recognition of what we would expect in terms of return, versus launches of that caliber, and that was very specific to the titles that launched on those dates in the quarter, as well as just the macro, I would say market gravity that we saw across smaller titles throughout the quarter. Okay. So thank you all for joining us for this quarter. We appreciate the support. We appreciate the good questions and the engagement today, and we'll speak to you next quarter."

It's great to be here with you all. We delivered solid performance across our business in Q2, driven by our EA Sports portfolio and our multi-platform live services business. our broad IP, exceptional talent and growing player network of more than $600 million are the foundation of strength and stability in an uneven macro environment. During Q2, we launched Premier Sports Games and provided over 120 content updates on 35 titles across our global catalog. Our teams are deeply committed to delivering amazing games and entertainment that inspire fans to play create, watch and forge enduring social connections. Our broad IP portfolio is unrivaled in the gaming industry. Foundational to our leadership is EA Sports with breadth and depth of partnerships that allow us to continue delivering deeply immersive experiences to fuel long-term growth. Our Global Football business demonstrates the power of a multi-platform ecosystem with a massive community engaging through multiple experiences. In Q2, we delivered our biggest EA Sports FIFA console and PC launch in history. In addition, in FIFA Mobile, daily, weekly and monthly active players were up more than 100% year-over-year. And our free-to-play FIFA Online service in Asia delivered record performance. Now the entire global football community across our ecosystem will benefit from the unique holiday timing of the World Cup. Next week, we'll launch new World Cup content into FIFA 23, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online designed to attract, engage and entertain players throughout the tournament and beyond. For nearly 30 years, we've delivered the biggest and highest quality football games to fans all over the world. Across our ecosystem, we've built the world's largest football community with our players, 90,000 athletes, 700 teams, 30 leagues and federations, and more than 300 partners. As we now move into the future with EA Sports FC, we have even greater opportunity to engage the global audience of 3.5 billion football fans. Players will continue to experience everything they love about our games today. The modes, leagues, competitions, clubs, athlete, brands and more. We'll push the technical boundaries for even greater innovation, immersion and authenticity. And through more platforms and new modalities, we will reach new football fans all around the world, bringing them into our global community. This is what EA Sports FC is all about. In this unique year with our biggest ever console and PC title, a deeply engaging worldwide mobile experience, our online PC services in Asia and now with men's and women's World Cup content coming we are in an incredible position to unlock a truly extraordinary future with EA Sports FC. As the consumption of entertainment and sport converge and grow, EA Sports offers fans immersive experiences like no other, an ability to play, create, watch and connect with friends and the sports they love, 365 days a year. Now more than ever, Madden NFL is deeply ingrained into the fabric of NFL fandom, reaching broader entertainment audiences. With the sport of F1 continuing its growth trajectory, especially in the U.S., we are well positioned to expand the total addressable market for our F1 franchise. We have more than 200 million players engaged in our EA Sports games. As we look to the future of FC, Madden NFL, F1, NHL, UFC, PGA Tour and Mall, we will continue growing these ecosystems to reach new fans, expand in new experiences and create more social connectivity to fuel the enjoyment of sport. Our owned IP franchises continue to be among the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Apex Legends is driving massive growth in emerging markets, and the team continues to build its content, universe, characters and storylines across multiple platforms and experiences. As we expand our console, PC and mobile experiences, Apex has captured the imagination of our global community beyond play. Not only are they playing, watching and competing, they're captivated by the law, the world's and storylines in and outside the game. We are just getting started and believe Apex will be one of the most important IPs in the world. Engagement in our Sims franchise continues to grow with millions of players unleashing their imaginations full of creativity, humor and individuality, both in-game and across the entire ecosystem. We expect engagement to grow with the Sims 4 base game recently becoming free to enter. Looking ahead, our team is working on a new creative platform for our Sims community giving them more collaborative ways to play, create, connect and share stories with their friends. In Q2, we also announced an exciting long-term multi-game collaboration with Marvel joining forces with a cultural defining powerhouse to expand our entertainment offerings. From our EA Sports League partners to Disney's Star Wars and Marvel Universes and more, we're partnering to grow our global communities, build value together and co-create the future of entertainment. Our player network of more than 600 million worldwide continues to grow. The unique value of this network is our ability to create new communities and meaningful connections that matter. In fact, more than 3/4 of EA players engage with gaming content beyond the game itself, reading, watching and creating content and engaging in social conversations through shared fandom. With EA Sports FC, Apex, the Sims, Skate and more, all poised to fuel fun and social connection, our growing network will continue adding long-term value. As we look ahead, our talent teams are focused on building extraordinary experiences that drive deep engagement to grow our communities and reach new audiences, particularly Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who are turning to games as their preferred choice for entertainment and social connection. Games continue to be one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment and the social networks of the future. We're in the privileged position of creating what people love doing more than anything else with their friends and family. Through our broad IP, our creative talent and our growing network of players, we are well positioned to lead the future of entertainment and deliver long-term value. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Suh: Thanks, and hello to everyone. As Andrew said, we had another solid quarter. Driven by our EA Sports portfolio and our multi-platform live services business. And importantly, engagement from our players around the globe across both platforms and our broad portfolio of games continued to be strong fueling our resilient live services business and enabling us to deliver on our commitments even as we navigate through an uneven environment. Net bookings for the second quarter were $1.75 billion and in line with our expectations, down 5% or 2% in constant currency due to the timing of the F1 launch with the strength in console and PC offsetting mobile. Our live services net bookings were also in line with our expectations, down 3% year-on-year or flat in constant currency due to the timing of the FIFA launch offset by strength elsewhere in the business. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 73% of our business. And with regard to full game sales, digital sales accounted for 66% of units sold through, up 5 percentage points from last year. Our EA Sports portfolio was the highlight and driver of Q2 net bookings. We saw strength across the entire FIFA franchise in the quarter, further demonstrating the power of our multi-platform ecosystem. FIFA net bookings grew 6% in constant currency, and we saw engagement increase significantly across all platforms. As Andrew mentioned, we delivered a record launch on FIFA 23. In the first 4 weeks, FIFA 23 sell-through unit sales were up 10% versus the comparable period for FIFA 22 and FUT players are up 6%. With the launch of Madden 23, Madden Ultimate Team players and net bookings are both up double digits year-on-year. We delivered Q2 net revenue of $1.9 billion, in line with our expectations and with a higher mix of console and PC-based revenue, gross margins and underlying profit were well above our expectations. Operating expenses were up 2% on last year, in line with our expectations as we continue to take a disciplined approach to investing in our development teams and new product launches. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $112 million, and we returned $378 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow is up 26% year-on-year. Now turning to guidance. We are providing an updated guidance range today, primarily due to the persistent FX rate environment. Just over half of our sales are generated outside of the U.S., and the U.S. dollar strengthened between 7% and 15% versus our largest foreign currencies when compared to rates at the time of our initial FY '23 guidance. As a result, we now expect an FX impact of approximately $200 million versus our initial full year net bookings guide as the impact will grow in our second half and into FY '24 at current exchange rates. Beyond FX, our business fundamentals remain healthy with strong player engagement trends across our platforms and franchises. We expect strength from our console and PC game franchises to offset most of the impact of the current mobile market softness. In particular, we expect to see the momentum of the FIFA 23 launch carry into the second half, aided by excitement surrounding the World Cup. With these factors considered, we are revising our full year net bookings guidance to $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion, up 2% to 4% year-on-year or 6% to 9% in constant currency. We expect fiscal '23 GAAP revenue to be $7.55 billion to $7.75 billion and expect cost of revenue to be $1.845 billion to $1.89 billion, below our prior range, reflecting the gross margin benefit from the revenue mix shift due to the relative strength of our console and PC franchises. We continue to be disciplined in our spend while also carefully prioritizing investments to fuel our long-term growth, and we expect operating expenses to be $4.245 billion to $4.295 billion. Accordingly, our updated GAAP earnings per share guidance is now higher at $3.11 to $3.34. Importantly, our expectations for underlying profitability for the year remain unchanged, even after accounting for the FX headwinds. We are also reaffirming our guidance for operating cash flow at $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion, with capital expenditures of about $200 million that results in free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the quarter. We expect Q3 '23 net bookings to be $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion, driven by our annualized franchises plus the launch of Need for Speed Unbound on December 2. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue to be $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $560 million to $580 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.08 billion to $1.09 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.59 for the third quarter. To summarize, our solid second quarter results again demonstrate the power of the EA model. We carry momentum into the second half. FIFA is off and running with the World Cup set to accelerate engagement. Need for Speed Unbound is ready for launch and a strong slate is queued up for Q4. We've extended the Apex franchise to mobile, enabling us to reach more people in more geographies than ever before and expect it to continue to grow over time. And with the Sims 4 now free to enter, we look forward to welcoming more players than ever into this beloved franchise. With our strong pipeline, healthy engagement trends, durable and highly recurring live services model and a continued focus on discipline and execution, we are well positioned for the future. Now I'll hand it back over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. In Q2, EA delivered strong engagement and deeply immersive experiences across our portfolio with new EA Sports titles and multi-platform live services powering the business. We have a deep slate of new titles set for the second half of the year. Entertainment is a fundamental human need. And in this dynamic environment, we are focusing on our strengths, providing amazing games and live services that inspire the world to play. With our incredible talent, our growing play network and more people than ever engaging and connecting through games, we are excited to lead and create the future of entertainment. Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matthew Cost from Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost: I have two here. So in an environment where, Andrew, you mentioned, obviously, things are changing, consumers are under pressure. Are you observing any changes in the behavior of users. For example, are people perhaps prioritizing buying a copy of FIFA and maybe spending less on the Ultimate Team or is there anything that you've noticed that's starting to shift in the behavior of your users? And then secondly, on the pipeline, I think the fourth quarter is still showing a major title that doesn't have a specific name to it yet. Should we interpret that as there's a title that's tentatively slated for the fourth quarter, but it could potentially be pushed out? Just any color you can add there?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Great questions. First one on user behavior. I think the one thing to reinforce is we are seeing extraordinary engagement across our business, particularly in our key titles like FIFA and like Apex and like The Sims. And remember, this extraordinary engagement of what was already extraordinary engagement coming through COVID and many had believed that we were going to see meaningful changes, a meaningful drop-off to our engagement post-COVID as the world kind of went mostly back to normal. And we haven't seen that yet. We've continued to see really strong engagement across our products. And certainly, with the launch of FIFA and Madden, both of which are up and the ongoing strength in Apex and The Sims, we feel really good about the future. What we do want to say, though, is that we're going to be very deliberate as we move through the back half of the year. We've got an extraordinary slate through the back half. We feel very good about that slate. But it's hard to ignore all of the narrative around us and some of the commentary around what might be challenging economic times particularly in Europe that seems to be dealing with that more dramatically so far than the U.S. As it stands right now, we haven't seen meaningful shifts in behavior. We expect that we will grow but we also want to be very thoughtful, focused and deliberate as we move through this environment because if it gets really bad, I don't think anybody is immune, but I think what we've demonstrated is that we're unbelievably resilient and why we're focused on building incredible games and driving deep engagement with our community, which so far is working really, really well for us. On the second point around the title, you shouldn't read anything into that other than the nature of marketing in our industry has meaningfully changed over the past 5 or 6 years. You might remember when we launched Apex Legends, we didn't tell anybody about it until about 48 hours before the community get to play it. And as we continue to see the shift, the big shift, of course, in the recent decade was a move from television to digital. We've moved into more targeted digital and now we're moving in a more targeted timing around digital. And so for each franchise, our development teams and marketing teams come together and think through what is the most appropriate time to begin meaningfully communicating with our community around what titles are coming. And so we feel really good about our slate. We feel really good about that particular title as it turns out. Actually really, really good. But it just -- our teams right now are still working through the appropriate timing for launching and marketing, communicating around that title.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Soff from Deutsche Bank.\nBenjamin Soff: Thanks for the question. So pretty exciting stuff with the Marvel partnership. I was wondering if you guys could maybe talk a little bit more about what that might mean for the long-term growth for your business? And the press release referenced at least 3 games, I believe. So what do you think some of the things are that your partner might be looking for as they evaluate whether or not to extend this partnership to additional games?\nLaura Miele: Thanks, Benjamin. Great question. When we think about our growth potential in our portfolio, we certainly consider the games that we create, the world, the characters. We also look at the expansion of our player community and the diversity of players that we can bring in. When you think about the breadth of our portfolio from real-world sports to our original IP, including Sims, Apex, Battlefield, Skate, Need for Speed. We also have licensed IP. You think about Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and of course, now Marvel, as you mentioned. So we consider this licensed IP, an incredibly important component of expanding, diversifying and casting our net wider to bring new players in. And when we looked at our Star Wars business, as an example, we brought millions of players into our community and what we realized and have seen is that over 40% of those players have gone on to play other games in our portfolio. So we consider adding licensed IP as a pretty significant engagement model to our overall community as we grow. And we're just thrilled to welcome the Marvel partners into our creative teams, and we're incredibly confident that we're going to build meaningful content for our fans. We have generally approached these types of creative partnerships kind of away from the contract. We don't want it to be a transactional partner to really embrace a creative partnership and co-create together. And we've seen great success in our past, and we expect no difference for the future with Marvel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Dessouky from Bank of America.\nOmar Dessouky: I'd like to ask about your 4 objectives of play, create, watch and social and how they're going to affect your business long term? And then I have a follow-up. So the first question is, are these initiatives you need to undertake in order to keep pace with the growth in the video game industry or exceed growth in the video game industry? And as you build out these features around your core franchises, sort of 5 years out, by what factor could they help your core franchises grow? And then I have a follow-up.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Great question. So as we think about the 4 key vectors of opportunity for us, play, create, watch and connect. The first thing to -- as we look at existing network of plays over 600 million. As we look at new onboarding plays in the kind of Gen Z and Gen Alpha populations, what we discover is the first thing that they are expecting from us is that we expand play. So when I started building games this industry over 20 years ago, we were primarily playing single-player games or on-the-couch games. We then moved from single player to multiplayer, off-line to online, one-on-one to one versus many. We've seen these ongoing inflection points that have expanded the nature of play. I think as we are looking now and as you look at what we're doing in and around our games like FIFA, like Madden, like The Sims, like Apex and many others, is we are expanding the modalities of play beyond what might have been a traditional mechanic within in a game. And as we continue to drive these franchises forward, we start asking ourselves what happens in FC when you're not playing on the pitch? What happens in The Sims when you leave your home and go to someone else's home? What happens in Apex when you move beyond the existing map or the existing modality of play? And so every time we offer an expanded play option, what we do see is it attracts more people and it drives deeper engagement in the franchise. Also, as we look at these generations of course, you don't have to look very far to see that created such a big and important part of all entertainment, particularly games. And as you look at YouTube and TikTok and Snap and others over the past 5 or 10 years, we've seen this become an even more important part of entertainment and social connection amongst these audiences. And as we think now about -- even if we go back as far as creating things in The Sims and only in Battlefield moment and sharing highlights from FIFA, and now the ability for players to come in and move things around in the world as a first step, create new things and put them into the world as a second step and really create new aspects of these worlds as a third step what we see again is that more than half of our community engages in player-created content. And so it attracts and it onboards new players. I watch my 7-year-old son get introduced to new games because he's watching created content on YouTube for the games that we make. And quite frankly, some of the games that our competitors make. And so this notion of creativity and the ability to engage the community to create is a really important part of our future both in the expansion of our worlds to fuel the insatiable appetite for content that our global community of players has but also to deepen engagement. Again, and as part of that, watch is becoming a really important part. We get 2 billion or 3 billion hours of play in FIFA a year, and we get nearly as much of that watching FIFA game play. The same is true for Apex. We're seeing this grow more and more across our ecosystem. And then finally, we're seeing connections that are formed amongst 4 and 5 and 6 people. These atomic units as part of these global communities that are the most meaningful connections. These players are spending 90 minutes, 2 hours a day together, playing the games together and then sharing that content beyond the traditional boundaries of games. And so as we think about our opportunities across these 4 vectors, we really think about it, which of these things are going to allow us to attract more people, we think it's very reasonable to believe that we can entertain 1 billion people in play. And we think about these things in the context of driving deeper engagement in the overall ecosystem, being it's very reasonable to believe that we can get that 1 billion people to engage with us for at least an hour a day. And what we know about our business is that people spend money where they spend their time and provided we offer incredible innovation, incredible creativity, incredible quality and incredible value that, that will ultimately present extraordinary opportunities for financial growth for us in the future.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. A wonderful answer. So it sounds like you're really at the forefront of innovation rather than this just being table stakes for the video game industry of the future. My second -- correct me if I'm wrong. My second question is, in the past, like in 2017, you've said that you spend about 25% of your R&D budget on new IP. Things that may never see the light of day. So based on fiscal '22, that would be around $400 million to $500 million. First of all, is that kind of still the case? And second of all, as you build out the tool sets necessary to achieve play, create, watch and social, should we think about incremental R&D spend on top of that? Or will the kind of additional expenses to create out those tool sets and initiatives be part of that 25% or even the existing budgets within existing franchises?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Great question. The first thing to acknowledge is, and I've talked about 20%, 25% in the past. One, it's not a static number. It changes over time based on what's going on in our various incubation and development and production pipelines. As we think about investing, the primary investment for us is always going to be building incredible games. And for us, that really falls in 2 key categories: building out these global online gaming communities around our biggest IP: FC, Battlefield, Apex, The Sims, Madden, Skate is coming down the pipe. And so that's 1 category investment for us. And a lot of that 20%, 25% goes into new modalities of play and you create in and around those ecosystems that are very proven, very stable and represent extraordinary opportunities for growth. The second area is around building these worlds and creating these characters and tell these amazing stories both in our owned IP and in the IP of our partners as we co-create the future of entertainment. And we really think about interactive storytelling as the future form of storytelling that most consumers will choose as their first form of entertainment. And a chunk of that 20%, 25% goes into those things, things that we do with our partners at Disney across Star Wars and Marvel will fall into that category. The third category, which is a much smaller category, but probably represents one of the biggest long-term upside opportunities is how do we think about deriving value from the power of our network beyond the bounds of nutritional game experience. We've got 600 million, we're going to go to 1 billion. I hope that we get to 2 billion people in our network and they spend 1.5 hours a day in our games, and then they spend another 90 minutes a day doing things outside of our games, but that are deeply connected to the games that they play. And what is our opportunity there? And one such opportunity might be, how do we disrupt the consumption of sport. How do we really think about sport from an interactive viewpoint. If you star in one of our games, but you are a deep sports fan, what other things might be able to do with you with our partners that would fuel your sports fandom. And while that's a relatively small investment for us today, it does represent a pretty significant upside to the expansion of what we're able to do with our global network of players and fans around the world over the course of the next 3 to 5 years. As we think about investment more broadly, you shouldn't imagine that this is deep incremental investment. This is about really focusing our existing investment in the right areas. And part of what we have to do as a company always is be very deliberate, very disciplined and very focused on how we invest. And because we're in the entertainment business, we have to acknowledge that not everything we do will work or at least work exactly as we planned. And we have to be very ready to move and shift and reshape our organization and the investment that we put into it to drive that future. So you shouldn't expect some giant new incremental spend, but you should expect us to continue to move investment around our company and where we feel like there are really big upside opportunities in the area of global online communities, in the area of interactive storytelling, in the area of hiring the power of our network beyond the bounds of a traditional gaming experience and where we believe that we have very strong likelihood of success and growth, we will invest behind those things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: I hope everyone on the team as well. Maybe just on the mobile front, we've obviously gotten a lot of questions from investors has been sort of the last 12 to 15 months of headwinds that have been created by Apple's privacy changes. But obviously, there's a long tailed opportunity to get mobile right, especially AAA games on mobile over the medium to long term, and there's been a lot of capital allocated towards M&A in mobile. How are you thinking about investing behind mobile? Mobile continuing to grow as a percentage of the mix and how to navigate some of the maybe challenges in terms of growing the user base and monetizing in game that mobile continues to face in this environment?\nLaura Miele: Thanks, Eric. Great question. We see mobile remaining one of the largest platforms in the games business, and it represents a pretty significant growth path for us, particularly with our large franchises. So there's a couple of parts have how to think about this. And we are looking at mobile as an expansion in multiplier on our big franchises such as FIFA, Apex. As an example, when we look at our FIFA mobile business, 75% of our FIFA mobile players exist outside of Europe and North America. So that's significant reach and global impact for our FIFA mobile game. So we continue to believe that the mobile business will be -- will contribute to these big online communities that Andrew has talked about and has discussed in our vision and strategy and be a multiplier for these gaming ecosystems for players. And when we think about a post-ATT world or post-IDFA world, what's most meaningful is having these large communities and well-known brands for strong reach. And so we are confident in our position to have an impact beyond some of the challenges that some are experiencing in a post-ATT world. As we think about our acquisitions and our stand-alone business, we continue to see strength in games such as Galaxy, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. And when we look at Glu, our Glu acquisition, that is some of those properties such as Design Home, Cabot fashion, we believe are going to be strong contributors to our lifestyle Sims sort of business. Then we also have the Tap Sports business that clearly we have big strength in sports. And so we continue to believe that those will contribute to our strategic growth path as we head into the future. So yes, there have been headwinds in the mobile market, and we continue to believe that mobile as a platform will provide the global player reach for our big franchises. And we believe with our big community, it will continue to help us with some of our stand-alone mobile games with our large communities and big brands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mario Lu from Barclays.\nMario Lu: The first one is on FIFA. Just wondering if you could help double quick on the main factors that attributed to the 10% unit growth year-on-year? Is it the new features such as cross-play? Is it the upcoming World Cup content? Anything you can add from today would be helpful.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, I think that the first one around our business there is we live in a symbiotic relationship with a real world of football. And the real world of football continues to grow. This is the world's game. It's the greatest game on the planet. There might be some that would argue with me on that front. But certainly, as you travel around the world, there are more fans of this sport than pretty much any other sport on the planet, and it continues to grow and the engagement by virtue of technology advancements around access to content continues to fuel growth in the sport itself. As you then think about what our teams do in the context of innovation and creativity in modes, and this is our biggest FIFA yet and we're delivering across all of the key leagues and teams and competitions in the world, and we're doing it at incredibly high quality, and we're really working closely with our fan base to understand how they want to experience interactive football through our game around the content that they love the most. And so as we look through -- over the last nearly 30 years, this is what this team has continued to do year in, year out. It has continued to grow year-over-year, and it really is the double multiplier of the growth of the sport itself combined with a team dedicated to innovation and creativity around that sport working in lockstep with a growing global community. And our expectation is that as we think forward to FC, that we're going to be able to do even more of this both in the context of immersion and authenticity of the very core of the sport as well as the expansion of what the overall experience can embody for football fans around the world.\nMario Lu: Great. And then just a second one on mobile, specifically on Apex Mobile. Just curious how it's progressing versus your internal expectations? And are there any early learnings that could be applied to other franchises like Battlefield that will ultimately be brought to mobile as well?\nLaura Miele: Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the mobile response earlier, mobile continues to contribute to the overall growth of some of our biggest franchises and brands. And that is certainly the case with Apex Mobile for the overall Apex brand. We're seeing player and geographic expansion in Southeast Asia, Middle East, Latin America. That is exactly how we had hoped for and what we were expecting. Now we are 24 weeks into our launch. And while we've delivered a strong experience, the rating on the App Store is quite strong, and we're proud of the quality of the game. And our core players have connected with it quite well. We are now focused on improving our retention for our more casual players, and that is definitely an area of focus for us and an area of improvement. And this is very much a natural part of the cycle and process as we bring these games to market. And we believe and we know that Apex Mobile will continue to help us drive the growth for the overall Apex mobile brand and franchise in the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Jefferies.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Let me ask a couple of questions. I guess Andrew, and maybe Laura can chime in here. When you talk about kind of the 4 big initiatives around social and whatnot, it seems like The Sims and maybe skate it solidly in kind of all 4 of those categories. Could you talk a little bit about how that kind of game design process goes as you try to figure out how to incorporate user-generated content and maybe a marketplace and maybe some sort of social fabric that overlays those types of games versus maybe what expectations are going to be from gamers who might think they just want to play a Skate game or just want to play kind of a housebuilding game?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I mean it's a longer and more complicated question than I probably have time for today, but I would tell you the way we think about it is really around player motivations. And when we design for a game, we're really thinking about what motivations are we trying to fulfill. And you've got 1 group that -- and I kind of go with a crude kind of cohort grouping you got 1 group who simply want to fuel the motivation of escape. They want to be able to disappear from the world they live in day-to-day and immerse themselves in a new world, and that be the sum total of their experience. And that's a really important thing for them. And we have to think about that across the breadth of our portfolio. There might be another group who says, \"Hey, I want to be able to -- I want to play -- I want to immerse myself in this world, but I want to do it with a core group of friends. And I want to bring them in. We call this an atomic unit. We see this amongst players in groups of kind of 4 or 5. These are the strongest connections we see in our network. And really, the experience they have is around doing things in the context of this group environment with 4 or 5 people. There's another group who says, \"Hey, I want to do this thing. I might do it by myself or I might do it with other people, but I really want to very quickly be able to share everything I'm doing with the outside want to capture cool moves I do. I want to be able to capture cool things I build and we were to share that almost immediately with the outside world through social media and other platforms. And it's really kind of an ad hoc thing, and it's not very polished, but it's just like, look, what I'm doing, and it's think about it like a kid on the playground who just has a summer salt on the trend is no, watch me. And so we're fueling that motivation. And then we have a fourth group who really wants to create and curate and share their content in a highly polished format. And that we see in the context of The Sims. And we'll certainly see it in the context of Skate, and we're seeing that kind of start to rise up in things that people want out of our FC experience and our Madden experience and certainly has been and will continue to be part of our Battlefield experience over time. And so really, when we think about designing and building these things, we start with a player first, and we start with what are the motivations they're trying to fulfill. And then we look to build tools that seamlessly and without friction, fulfill those motivations for them in the best way possible. And what we are seeing is that we're able to fulfill motivations across that full spectrum of cohorts, and that's why our network is growing so rapidly. That's why our engagement is continuing to be strong, and that's why people are spending more time in our games and using this as a platform to build deep enduring connections with their friends.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. That's helpful. And then as I think about some of the kind of less -- some of the games that maybe have less of that when I think about the single player -- the single player stuff you're building. Is some of the motivation there at the end of the day, somewhat financial where -- my guess is the predictability of the success of whether it's the licensed IP or maybe some of the stuff out of a where you can -- where it's easier to kind of do the math on the ROI and it's just more predictable and you feel there's a need for those types of gains every single year?\nAndrew Wilson: Again, entertainment has been built on the creation of world, the development of character telling the story since time began, and we've experienced it in different forms over time, we had to go to the theater, then we would read about it, then we listened to it on the radio and then we watch it the movie, then we watch it in television. Now we experienced that through games. And it is how we entertain ourselves first and foremost, as we think about these great storytelling opportunities. And so again, as a publicly-traded company, we're always thinking about the financial return of the things that we do. But as we think about the full breadth of the consumption of sports and entertainment, these deep social experiences are very much about how we enjoy attainment, but the creation of world and development character and telling of stories is kind of the central life blood of entertainment more broadly. And as we think about this, it's not just about predictability because, again, there are being crappy worlds and crappy characters and story is being told. And so we work with our partners and we work with our own IP to do things in a truly compelling way, and we think it represents an extraordinary business opportunity as we don't believe humanity is going to turn it back on the nature of storytelling. As we look to the future, the nature of storytelling is almost certainly going to be interactive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Handler from MKM Partners.\nEric Handler: Wonder if you could talk a little bit about your decision to give the Lord of the Rings mobile gain a bit more time in soft launch given the current mobile market conditions. Right now, in this post-IDFA world, is it just too challenging to find good ROI channels to launch a new game on a mass market level? What is it you're seeing there? And then secondly, can you maybe talk about your decision to take The Sims to free-to-play model?\nLaura Miele: Eric, so we put the Lord of the Rings mobile game in the market and soft launch a few months ago, and it's being developed by the same team that created one of our most successful mobile games and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. And I would say it's actually a very normal part of our process to go out to soft launch and allow our community and player feedback to inform how we're thinking about game development. So we consider this to be a pretty normal natural part of our cycle and aren't seeing anything unnecessarily unusual. And the game and the game needs more time. We need more time to continue to flesh out our progression loops to simplify our -- for our first time user experiences. And we're confident that we will get to market soon with the game. And as you mentioned, having a big brand like Lord of the rings and a great creative partner, they're seeing good success in this franchise right now is going to help us in a post ATT world. So in partnership with our big online community that we have and a big Lord of the Rings brand and a healthy soft launch so we can get the game metrics and the game play right, we will come to market when the time is right for the game and for our players.\nAndrew Wilson: And on The Sims, again, it's nearly 10 years old now. I mean there are people who are going to want to play The Sims 4 -- yes it's nearly 10 years old now. When we think about -- there's a bunch of people who want to play that game who may not have even been born when we launch the game. And while we have a community of many tens of millions of people playing, we recognize the opportunity to really open up and bringing anyone who wants to experience The Sims 4. As we look to the last 12 months, about 90% of all revenue was from extra content, not the base game. And so as we think about the future, as we think about the evolution of The Sims experience and really bringing in more people to enjoy what The Sims offers the playing community. We felt that this was the right time. And I commend the team for really making this happen and really supporting their community. And what we've seen on balance is the community has been very thankful for this, very supportive of this and is looking forward to welcoming what we hope is many millions more into that ecosystem overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. And I think this is a topic that we've explored before, but with what looks like the sequel for Sims under development, I thought I'd bring this up again. And I think this, for lack of a better word, I guess, the lower and the body of work that exists in Sims 4 because, as you say, the game is like 10 years old now, and there's a lot of content that you've released over the years. And should we be thinking about how Sims 5 when it's released, may feel a little bit empty. And I think this is something that we worried about in the -- for Battlefield in the past. So what can we do as we think about sequels and follow-ups generally? Does this mean that things need to spend more time and development for that additional content? How should we think about that?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, it's a really good question, and I appreciate you using Sims as an example, but I think the question is probably broader than just The Sims. And I would say that there's not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Certainly, as we think about some of our iterative titles that we do each and every year, our objective is to build enough content and enough innovation and enough creativity that delivers extraordinary value for the amount that our community invest in each of those titles. And we have been very successful in doing that, and we commit many hundreds of people on those franchises to ensure that we deliver all of those things, particularly value to our community, to fulfill the expectations they have for what a new title would bring. We have other things like the titles that come out of BioWare that really is about giving them time to build out these worlds and create these characters and tell these stories in a new innovative and creative way. Without using The Sims as an example, but using things like Skate as a potential example and maybe others in our franchise, there's also an opportunity, in some cases, to have an existing experience continue while layering in a new modality of that experience on top. And certainly, what we're going to see with Skate is you're going to be able to get in there and you're going to be able to skate and do all the things that we've been able to do in Skate games in the past. But there's a whole new modality around creation and social connection, that's going to be a meaningful part of that game going forward. And so to answer your question, I think that we're looking at every franchise in its own stead, and we're asking ourselves, what is the right thing to do with respect to this franchise. Some for our iterative franchise is about getting just the right amount of people into a team to deliver innovation and creativity, for some like our BioWare franchise is about giving time to really build out these worlds characters and story lines. And for other franchises like Skate, and certainly, as we think about the future of Sims, it's how do we hold on to all of the goodness of the existing franchise and layer in new modalities and extensions of how you play these games for a growing and changing and evolving diverse community around the world.\nOperator: This question comes from Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company.\nDouglas Creutz: I was wondering if you could talk about Wild Hard a little bit. I think, normally, when you guys have partner titles, they tend to be lower-priced in de titles. But this -- I think, correct me if I'm wrong, is coming to market at a $70 price point. So -- should we think of the opportunity set here the way that we would think about it for a AAA title sort of in general? And is this a game you think has franchise potential down the line?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So first thing I would say just to differentiate there. I think what we have had is EA Originals, which were lower-priced titles. This was an initiative that we developed some years ago really to support the India community and the industry growth opportunity overall. What we were seeing in the industry was these India developers were kind of building these very cool games. They didn't have the means to get into market in a big way and they didn't have the ability to continue on because the business model wasn't working for them at least for their first title. And what we did at that time was go into the community and say, \"All right, let's handpick some really great teams who are building some really cool games around really cool IP. Let's help -- let's fund development for them. Let's get them distribution and let's give them the profits on the back end so that they can come together and build an even bigger game a second time around. Most of those have been smaller, lower-priced titles. However, in the history and -- I mean the company 22 years, we have a long and rich history of co-developing, co-publishing and distributing AAA full-priced IP, all the way back for as long as I can remember. We don't do as much of it anymore just because there's not as much of it out there that we think really fits the bill and is it a AAA quality bar that we believe can deliver against the expectations of these global communities at a full price point. We think Wild Heart is one. I mean I would tell you, it started with what felt like a pretty small idea for us internally. And every time we saw the product, we were wowed and mesmerized by what they were doing. The Monster Hunter genre is a relatively new genre. It exploded. It is ripe for innovation and creativity and expansion and what we see the team doing is all of the things that the community is asking for in the genre. And so -- and the response so far has been really, really strong. And so I don't want to get out over my skis on this one. But I would tell you, I saw it. I think it's incredible. The community has seen it, they think it's incredible. How big it can be. We don't quite know yet, but I think there's a path for this to be a really, really cool opportunity for us, for the development team and for the community at large.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird.\nColin Sebastian: I have a couple of follow-up questions. I guess first, Andrew, I just wanted to talk about the approach to World Cup this year, how that differs from the prior cup given some of the challenges last time around on the core franchise. And then on live services, if you wouldn't mind providing a little more color on engagement and monetization trends for Apex, just given this has been such a big part of the portfolio growth over the past few years. Are you satisfied with the trends there? And how do you expect those KPIs to trend with the launch of new content this quarter?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Let me grab the first part around World Cup, and then I'll let Chris speak to kind of engagement trends and those types of things around Apex. First, I might challenge the idea that we had troubles with the World Cup last time. But I might be base front. Again, I think we brought in and brought back about 12 million players back into the franchise with World Cup content. It was one of our highest engagement opportunities of that year. I think there may have been externally some expectations on higher revenue at that time. What you might remember we talked about was we believed it was a really strong engagement opportunity. We use it to bring people into the franchise and back to the franchise and we projected and predicted that it would drive growth in the out years beyond the World Cup. And of course, that has happened each and every year since that World Cup. So we feel really, really bullish on what this World Cup can do for us. What I would say without going into broad details, it is more deeply integrated into the mode. It was more kind of an add-on adjunct to the product. Last time it was very cool. It was great content. It was World Cup. What we -- what the team has done this time is we take that content and embed it more deeply into the overall experience of the game. And our expectation is that while it will bring people into the franchise and back to the franchise, it will also drive even deeper engagement over time. And we think that is good for the long-term prospects of the product, particularly as we launch FC next year to build and grow that community to its absolute greatest possible point at this juncture is a great opportunity for us.\nChristopher Suh: Great. And I'll jump in, Colin, and talk a little bit about our engagement. As we've talked about on this call, we're seeing -- we're in this enviable position of seeing healthy engagement trends across the breadth of our business. We talked a lot about FIFA. But Apex is another one where we're very pleased with the state of player engagement with Apex. We've grown that business, as you know, in a very short period of time into a substantial business. As Andrew talked about, it's one of the great IPs and entertainment. We're seeing very stable engagement. We continue to grow the franchise. We feel great about upcoming releases of new innovation into the game. It continues to be an important franchise for us, and we'll continue to invest behind it as well as feed growth now and into the future.\nAndrew Wilson: But today, I was going to say the same thing. Thank you to all for being with us today.\nOperator: And that's all the time we have for questions. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Miele",
            "content": "Thanks, Benjamin. Great question. When we think about our growth potential in our portfolio, we certainly consider the games that we create, the world, the characters. We also look at the expansion of our player community and the diversity of players that we can bring in. When you think about the breadth of our portfolio from real-world sports to our original IP, including Sims, Apex, Battlefield, Skate, Need for Speed. We also have licensed IP. You think about Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and of course, now Marvel, as you mentioned. So we consider this licensed IP, an incredibly important component of expanding, diversifying and casting our net wider to bring new players in. And when we looked at our Star Wars business, as an example, we brought millions of players into our community and what we realized and have seen is that over 40% of those players have gone on to play other games in our portfolio. So we consider adding licensed IP as a pretty significant engagement model to our overall community as we grow. And we're just thrilled to welcome the Marvel partners into our creative teams, and we're incredibly confident that we're going to build meaningful content for our fans. We have generally approached these types of creative partnerships kind of away from the contract. We don't want it to be a transactional partner to really embrace a creative partnership and co-create together. And we've seen great success in our past, and we expect no difference for the future with Marvel. Thanks, Eric. Great question. We see mobile remaining one of the largest platforms in the games business, and it represents a pretty significant growth path for us, particularly with our large franchises. So there's a couple of parts have how to think about this. And we are looking at mobile as an expansion in multiplier on our big franchises such as FIFA, Apex. As an example, when we look at our FIFA mobile business, 75% of our FIFA mobile players exist outside of Europe and North America. So that's significant reach and global impact for our FIFA mobile game. So we continue to believe that the mobile business will be -- will contribute to these big online communities that Andrew has talked about and has discussed in our vision and strategy and be a multiplier for these gaming ecosystems for players. And when we think about a post-ATT world or post-IDFA world, what's most meaningful is having these large communities and well-known brands for strong reach. And so we are confident in our position to have an impact beyond some of the challenges that some are experiencing in a post-ATT world. As we think about our acquisitions and our stand-alone business, we continue to see strength in games such as Galaxy, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. And when we look at Glu, our Glu acquisition, that is some of those properties such as Design Home, Cabot fashion, we believe are going to be strong contributors to our lifestyle Sims sort of business. Then we also have the Tap Sports business that clearly we have big strength in sports. And so we continue to believe that those will contribute to our strategic growth path as we head into the future. So yes, there have been headwinds in the mobile market, and we continue to believe that mobile as a platform will provide the global player reach for our big franchises. And we believe with our big community, it will continue to help us with some of our stand-alone mobile games with our large communities and big brands. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the mobile response earlier, mobile continues to contribute to the overall growth of some of our biggest franchises and brands. And that is certainly the case with Apex Mobile for the overall Apex brand. We're seeing player and geographic expansion in Southeast Asia, Middle East, Latin America. That is exactly how we had hoped for and what we were expecting. Now we are 24 weeks into our launch. And while we've delivered a strong experience, the rating on the App Store is quite strong, and we're proud of the quality of the game. And our core players have connected with it quite well. We are now focused on improving our retention for our more casual players, and that is definitely an area of focus for us and an area of improvement. And this is very much a natural part of the cycle and process as we bring these games to market. And we believe and we know that Apex Mobile will continue to help us drive the growth for the overall Apex mobile brand and franchise in the coming years. Eric, so we put the Lord of the Rings mobile game in the market and soft launch a few months ago, and it's being developed by the same team that created one of our most successful mobile games and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. And I would say it's actually a very normal part of our process to go out to soft launch and allow our community and player feedback to inform how we're thinking about game development. So we consider this to be a pretty normal natural part of our cycle and aren't seeing anything unnecessarily unusual. And the game and the game needs more time. We need more time to continue to flesh out our progression loops to simplify our -- for our first time user experiences. And we're confident that we will get to market soon with the game. And as you mentioned, having a big brand like Lord of the rings and a great creative partner, they're seeing good success in this franchise right now is going to help us in a post ATT world. So in partnership with our big online community that we have and a big Lord of the Rings brand and a healthy soft launch so we can get the game metrics and the game play right, we will come to market when the time is right for the game and for our players."

            "name": "Christopher Suh",
            "content": "Thanks, and hello to everyone. As Andrew said, we had another solid quarter. Driven by our EA Sports portfolio and our multi-platform live services business. And importantly, engagement from our players around the globe across both platforms and our broad portfolio of games continued to be strong fueling our resilient live services business and enabling us to deliver on our commitments even as we navigate through an uneven environment. Net bookings for the second quarter were $1.75 billion and in line with our expectations, down 5% or 2% in constant currency due to the timing of the F1 launch with the strength in console and PC offsetting mobile. Our live services net bookings were also in line with our expectations, down 3% year-on-year or flat in constant currency due to the timing of the FIFA launch offset by strength elsewhere in the business. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 73% of our business. And with regard to full game sales, digital sales accounted for 66% of units sold through, up 5 percentage points from last year. Our EA Sports portfolio was the highlight and driver of Q2 net bookings. We saw strength across the entire FIFA franchise in the quarter, further demonstrating the power of our multi-platform ecosystem. FIFA net bookings grew 6% in constant currency, and we saw engagement increase significantly across all platforms. As Andrew mentioned, we delivered a record launch on FIFA 23. In the first 4 weeks, FIFA 23 sell-through unit sales were up 10% versus the comparable period for FIFA 22 and FUT players are up 6%. With the launch of Madden 23, Madden Ultimate Team players and net bookings are both up double digits year-on-year. We delivered Q2 net revenue of $1.9 billion, in line with our expectations and with a higher mix of console and PC-based revenue, gross margins and underlying profit were well above our expectations. Operating expenses were up 2% on last year, in line with our expectations as we continue to take a disciplined approach to investing in our development teams and new product launches. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $112 million, and we returned $378 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow is up 26% year-on-year. Now turning to guidance. We are providing an updated guidance range today, primarily due to the persistent FX rate environment. Just over half of our sales are generated outside of the U.S., and the U.S. dollar strengthened between 7% and 15% versus our largest foreign currencies when compared to rates at the time of our initial FY '23 guidance. As a result, we now expect an FX impact of approximately $200 million versus our initial full year net bookings guide as the impact will grow in our second half and into FY '24 at current exchange rates. Beyond FX, our business fundamentals remain healthy with strong player engagement trends across our platforms and franchises. We expect strength from our console and PC game franchises to offset most of the impact of the current mobile market softness. In particular, we expect to see the momentum of the FIFA 23 launch carry into the second half, aided by excitement surrounding the World Cup. With these factors considered, we are revising our full year net bookings guidance to $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion, up 2% to 4% year-on-year or 6% to 9% in constant currency. We expect fiscal '23 GAAP revenue to be $7.55 billion to $7.75 billion and expect cost of revenue to be $1.845 billion to $1.89 billion, below our prior range, reflecting the gross margin benefit from the revenue mix shift due to the relative strength of our console and PC franchises. We continue to be disciplined in our spend while also carefully prioritizing investments to fuel our long-term growth, and we expect operating expenses to be $4.245 billion to $4.295 billion. Accordingly, our updated GAAP earnings per share guidance is now higher at $3.11 to $3.34. Importantly, our expectations for underlying profitability for the year remain unchanged, even after accounting for the FX headwinds. We are also reaffirming our guidance for operating cash flow at $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion, with capital expenditures of about $200 million that results in free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the quarter. We expect Q3 '23 net bookings to be $2.425 billion to $2.525 billion, driven by our annualized franchises plus the launch of Need for Speed Unbound on December 2. For the third quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue to be $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion, cost of revenue to be $560 million to $580 million and operating expenses of approximately $1.08 billion to $1.09 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.59 for the third quarter. To summarize, our solid second quarter results again demonstrate the power of the EA model. We carry momentum into the second half. FIFA is off and running with the World Cup set to accelerate engagement. Need for Speed Unbound is ready for launch and a strong slate is queued up for Q4. We've extended the Apex franchise to mobile, enabling us to reach more people in more geographies than ever before and expect it to continue to grow over time. And with the Sims 4 now free to enter, we look forward to welcoming more players than ever into this beloved franchise. With our strong pipeline, healthy engagement trends, durable and highly recurring live services model and a continued focus on discipline and execution, we are well positioned for the future. Now I'll hand it back over to Andrew. Great. And I'll jump in, Colin, and talk a little bit about our engagement. As we've talked about on this call, we're seeing -- we're in this enviable position of seeing healthy engagement trends across the breadth of our business. We talked a lot about FIFA. But Apex is another one where we're very pleased with the state of player engagement with Apex. We've grown that business, as you know, in a very short period of time into a substantial business. As Andrew talked about, it's one of the great IPs and entertainment. We're seeing very stable engagement. We continue to grow the franchise. We feel great about upcoming releases of new innovation into the game. It continues to be an important franchise for us, and we'll continue to invest behind it as well as feed growth now and into the future."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. It's great to be here with you all. We delivered solid performance across our business in Q2, driven by our EA Sports portfolio and our multi-platform live services business. our broad IP, exceptional talent and growing player network of more than $600 million are the foundation of strength and stability in an uneven macro environment. During Q2, we launched Premier Sports Games and provided over 120 content updates on 35 titles across our global catalog. Our teams are deeply committed to delivering amazing games and entertainment that inspire fans to play create, watch and forge enduring social connections. Our broad IP portfolio is unrivaled in the gaming industry. Foundational to our leadership is EA Sports with breadth and depth of partnerships that allow us to continue delivering deeply immersive experiences to fuel long-term growth. Our Global Football business demonstrates the power of a multi-platform ecosystem with a massive community engaging through multiple experiences. In Q2, we delivered our biggest EA Sports FIFA console and PC launch in history. In addition, in FIFA Mobile, daily, weekly and monthly active players were up more than 100% year-over-year. And our free-to-play FIFA Online service in Asia delivered record performance. Now the entire global football community across our ecosystem will benefit from the unique holiday timing of the World Cup. Next week, we'll launch new World Cup content into FIFA 23, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online designed to attract, engage and entertain players throughout the tournament and beyond. For nearly 30 years, we've delivered the biggest and highest quality football games to fans all over the world. Across our ecosystem, we've built the world's largest football community with our players, 90,000 athletes, 700 teams, 30 leagues and federations, and more than 300 partners. As we now move into the future with EA Sports FC, we have even greater opportunity to engage the global audience of 3.5 billion football fans. Players will continue to experience everything they love about our games today. The modes, leagues, competitions, clubs, athlete, brands and more. We'll push the technical boundaries for even greater innovation, immersion and authenticity. And through more platforms and new modalities, we will reach new football fans all around the world, bringing them into our global community. This is what EA Sports FC is all about. In this unique year with our biggest ever console and PC title, a deeply engaging worldwide mobile experience, our online PC services in Asia and now with men's and women's World Cup content coming we are in an incredible position to unlock a truly extraordinary future with EA Sports FC. As the consumption of entertainment and sport converge and grow, EA Sports offers fans immersive experiences like no other, an ability to play, create, watch and connect with friends and the sports they love, 365 days a year. Now more than ever, Madden NFL is deeply ingrained into the fabric of NFL fandom, reaching broader entertainment audiences. With the sport of F1 continuing its growth trajectory, especially in the U.S., we are well positioned to expand the total addressable market for our F1 franchise. We have more than 200 million players engaged in our EA Sports games. As we look to the future of FC, Madden NFL, F1, NHL, UFC, PGA Tour and Mall, we will continue growing these ecosystems to reach new fans, expand in new experiences and create more social connectivity to fuel the enjoyment of sport. Our owned IP franchises continue to be among the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Apex Legends is driving massive growth in emerging markets, and the team continues to build its content, universe, characters and storylines across multiple platforms and experiences. As we expand our console, PC and mobile experiences, Apex has captured the imagination of our global community beyond play. Not only are they playing, watching and competing, they're captivated by the law, the world's and storylines in and outside the game. We are just getting started and believe Apex will be one of the most important IPs in the world. Engagement in our Sims franchise continues to grow with millions of players unleashing their imaginations full of creativity, humor and individuality, both in-game and across the entire ecosystem. We expect engagement to grow with the Sims 4 base game recently becoming free to enter. Looking ahead, our team is working on a new creative platform for our Sims community giving them more collaborative ways to play, create, connect and share stories with their friends. In Q2, we also announced an exciting long-term multi-game collaboration with Marvel joining forces with a cultural defining powerhouse to expand our entertainment offerings. From our EA Sports League partners to Disney's Star Wars and Marvel Universes and more, we're partnering to grow our global communities, build value together and co-create the future of entertainment. Our player network of more than 600 million worldwide continues to grow. The unique value of this network is our ability to create new communities and meaningful connections that matter. In fact, more than 3/4 of EA players engage with gaming content beyond the game itself, reading, watching and creating content and engaging in social conversations through shared fandom. With EA Sports FC, Apex, the Sims, Skate and more, all poised to fuel fun and social connection, our growing network will continue adding long-term value. As we look ahead, our talent teams are focused on building extraordinary experiences that drive deep engagement to grow our communities and reach new audiences, particularly Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who are turning to games as their preferred choice for entertainment and social connection. Games continue to be one of the fastest-growing forms of entertainment and the social networks of the future. We're in the privileged position of creating what people love doing more than anything else with their friends and family. Through our broad IP, our creative talent and our growing network of players, we are well positioned to lead the future of entertainment and deliver long-term value. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris. Thanks, Chris. In Q2, EA delivered strong engagement and deeply immersive experiences across our portfolio with new EA Sports titles and multi-platform live services powering the business. We have a deep slate of new titles set for the second half of the year. Entertainment is a fundamental human need. And in this dynamic environment, we are focusing on our strengths, providing amazing games and live services that inspire the world to play. With our incredible talent, our growing play network and more people than ever engaging and connecting through games, we are excited to lead and create the future of entertainment. Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Yes. Great questions. First one on user behavior. I think the one thing to reinforce is we are seeing extraordinary engagement across our business, particularly in our key titles like FIFA and like Apex and like The Sims. And remember, this extraordinary engagement of what was already extraordinary engagement coming through COVID and many had believed that we were going to see meaningful changes, a meaningful drop-off to our engagement post-COVID as the world kind of went mostly back to normal. And we haven't seen that yet. We've continued to see really strong engagement across our products. And certainly, with the launch of FIFA and Madden, both of which are up and the ongoing strength in Apex and The Sims, we feel really good about the future. What we do want to say, though, is that we're going to be very deliberate as we move through the back half of the year. We've got an extraordinary slate through the back half. We feel very good about that slate. But it's hard to ignore all of the narrative around us and some of the commentary around what might be challenging economic times particularly in Europe that seems to be dealing with that more dramatically so far than the U.S. As it stands right now, we haven't seen meaningful shifts in behavior. We expect that we will grow but we also want to be very thoughtful, focused and deliberate as we move through this environment because if it gets really bad, I don't think anybody is immune, but I think what we've demonstrated is that we're unbelievably resilient and why we're focused on building incredible games and driving deep engagement with our community, which so far is working really, really well for us. On the second point around the title, you shouldn't read anything into that other than the nature of marketing in our industry has meaningfully changed over the past 5 or 6 years. You might remember when we launched Apex Legends, we didn't tell anybody about it until about 48 hours before the community get to play it. And as we continue to see the shift, the big shift, of course, in the recent decade was a move from television to digital. We've moved into more targeted digital and now we're moving in a more targeted timing around digital. And so for each franchise, our development teams and marketing teams come together and think through what is the most appropriate time to begin meaningfully communicating with our community around what titles are coming. And so we feel really good about our slate. We feel really good about that particular title as it turns out. Actually really, really good. But it just -- our teams right now are still working through the appropriate timing for launching and marketing, communicating around that title. Yes. Great question. So as we think about the 4 key vectors of opportunity for us, play, create, watch and connect. The first thing to -- as we look at existing network of plays over 600 million. As we look at new onboarding plays in the kind of Gen Z and Gen Alpha populations, what we discover is the first thing that they are expecting from us is that we expand play. So when I started building games this industry over 20 years ago, we were primarily playing single-player games or on-the-couch games. We then moved from single player to multiplayer, off-line to online, one-on-one to one versus many. We've seen these ongoing inflection points that have expanded the nature of play. I think as we are looking now and as you look at what we're doing in and around our games like FIFA, like Madden, like The Sims, like Apex and many others, is we are expanding the modalities of play beyond what might have been a traditional mechanic within in a game. And as we continue to drive these franchises forward, we start asking ourselves what happens in FC when you're not playing on the pitch? What happens in The Sims when you leave your home and go to someone else's home? What happens in Apex when you move beyond the existing map or the existing modality of play? And so every time we offer an expanded play option, what we do see is it attracts more people and it drives deeper engagement in the franchise. Also, as we look at these generations of course, you don't have to look very far to see that created such a big and important part of all entertainment, particularly games. And as you look at YouTube and TikTok and Snap and others over the past 5 or 10 years, we've seen this become an even more important part of entertainment and social connection amongst these audiences. And as we think now about -- even if we go back as far as creating things in The Sims and only in Battlefield moment and sharing highlights from FIFA, and now the ability for players to come in and move things around in the world as a first step, create new things and put them into the world as a second step and really create new aspects of these worlds as a third step what we see again is that more than half of our community engages in player-created content. And so it attracts and it onboards new players. I watch my 7-year-old son get introduced to new games because he's watching created content on YouTube for the games that we make. And quite frankly, some of the games that our competitors make. And so this notion of creativity and the ability to engage the community to create is a really important part of our future both in the expansion of our worlds to fuel the insatiable appetite for content that our global community of players has but also to deepen engagement. Again, and as part of that, watch is becoming a really important part. We get 2 billion or 3 billion hours of play in FIFA a year, and we get nearly as much of that watching FIFA game play. The same is true for Apex. We're seeing this grow more and more across our ecosystem. And then finally, we're seeing connections that are formed amongst 4 and 5 and 6 people. These atomic units as part of these global communities that are the most meaningful connections. These players are spending 90 minutes, 2 hours a day together, playing the games together and then sharing that content beyond the traditional boundaries of games. And so as we think about our opportunities across these 4 vectors, we really think about it, which of these things are going to allow us to attract more people, we think it's very reasonable to believe that we can entertain 1 billion people in play. And we think about these things in the context of driving deeper engagement in the overall ecosystem, being it's very reasonable to believe that we can get that 1 billion people to engage with us for at least an hour a day. And what we know about our business is that people spend money where they spend their time and provided we offer incredible innovation, incredible creativity, incredible quality and incredible value that, that will ultimately present extraordinary opportunities for financial growth for us in the future. Yes. Great question. The first thing to acknowledge is, and I've talked about 20%, 25% in the past. One, it's not a static number. It changes over time based on what's going on in our various incubation and development and production pipelines. As we think about investing, the primary investment for us is always going to be building incredible games. And for us, that really falls in 2 key categories: building out these global online gaming communities around our biggest IP: FC, Battlefield, Apex, The Sims, Madden, Skate is coming down the pipe. And so that's 1 category investment for us. And a lot of that 20%, 25% goes into new modalities of play and you create in and around those ecosystems that are very proven, very stable and represent extraordinary opportunities for growth. The second area is around building these worlds and creating these characters and tell these amazing stories both in our owned IP and in the IP of our partners as we co-create the future of entertainment. And we really think about interactive storytelling as the future form of storytelling that most consumers will choose as their first form of entertainment. And a chunk of that 20%, 25% goes into those things, things that we do with our partners at Disney across Star Wars and Marvel will fall into that category. The third category, which is a much smaller category, but probably represents one of the biggest long-term upside opportunities is how do we think about deriving value from the power of our network beyond the bounds of nutritional game experience. We've got 600 million, we're going to go to 1 billion. I hope that we get to 2 billion people in our network and they spend 1.5 hours a day in our games, and then they spend another 90 minutes a day doing things outside of our games, but that are deeply connected to the games that they play. And what is our opportunity there? And one such opportunity might be, how do we disrupt the consumption of sport. How do we really think about sport from an interactive viewpoint. If you star in one of our games, but you are a deep sports fan, what other things might be able to do with you with our partners that would fuel your sports fandom. And while that's a relatively small investment for us today, it does represent a pretty significant upside to the expansion of what we're able to do with our global network of players and fans around the world over the course of the next 3 to 5 years. As we think about investment more broadly, you shouldn't imagine that this is deep incremental investment. This is about really focusing our existing investment in the right areas. And part of what we have to do as a company always is be very deliberate, very disciplined and very focused on how we invest. And because we're in the entertainment business, we have to acknowledge that not everything we do will work or at least work exactly as we planned. And we have to be very ready to move and shift and reshape our organization and the investment that we put into it to drive that future. So you shouldn't expect some giant new incremental spend, but you should expect us to continue to move investment around our company and where we feel like there are really big upside opportunities in the area of global online communities, in the area of interactive storytelling, in the area of hiring the power of our network beyond the bounds of a traditional gaming experience and where we believe that we have very strong likelihood of success and growth, we will invest behind those things. Yes, I think that the first one around our business there is we live in a symbiotic relationship with a real world of football. And the real world of football continues to grow. This is the world's game. It's the greatest game on the planet. There might be some that would argue with me on that front. But certainly, as you travel around the world, there are more fans of this sport than pretty much any other sport on the planet, and it continues to grow and the engagement by virtue of technology advancements around access to content continues to fuel growth in the sport itself. As you then think about what our teams do in the context of innovation and creativity in modes, and this is our biggest FIFA yet and we're delivering across all of the key leagues and teams and competitions in the world, and we're doing it at incredibly high quality, and we're really working closely with our fan base to understand how they want to experience interactive football through our game around the content that they love the most. And so as we look through -- over the last nearly 30 years, this is what this team has continued to do year in, year out. It has continued to grow year-over-year, and it really is the double multiplier of the growth of the sport itself combined with a team dedicated to innovation and creativity around that sport working in lockstep with a growing global community. And our expectation is that as we think forward to FC, that we're going to be able to do even more of this both in the context of immersion and authenticity of the very core of the sport as well as the expansion of what the overall experience can embody for football fans around the world. Yes. I mean it's a longer and more complicated question than I probably have time for today, but I would tell you the way we think about it is really around player motivations. And when we design for a game, we're really thinking about what motivations are we trying to fulfill. And you've got 1 group that -- and I kind of go with a crude kind of cohort grouping you got 1 group who simply want to fuel the motivation of escape. They want to be able to disappear from the world they live in day-to-day and immerse themselves in a new world, and that be the sum total of their experience. And that's a really important thing for them. And we have to think about that across the breadth of our portfolio. There might be another group who says, \"Hey, I want to be able to -- I want to play -- I want to immerse myself in this world, but I want to do it with a core group of friends. And I want to bring them in. We call this an atomic unit. We see this amongst players in groups of kind of 4 or 5. These are the strongest connections we see in our network. And really, the experience they have is around doing things in the context of this group environment with 4 or 5 people. There's another group who says, \"Hey, I want to do this thing. I might do it by myself or I might do it with other people, but I really want to very quickly be able to share everything I'm doing with the outside want to capture cool moves I do. I want to be able to capture cool things I build and we were to share that almost immediately with the outside world through social media and other platforms. And it's really kind of an ad hoc thing, and it's not very polished, but it's just like, look, what I'm doing, and it's think about it like a kid on the playground who just has a summer salt on the trend is no, watch me. And so we're fueling that motivation. And then we have a fourth group who really wants to create and curate and share their content in a highly polished format. And that we see in the context of The Sims. And we'll certainly see it in the context of Skate, and we're seeing that kind of start to rise up in things that people want out of our FC experience and our Madden experience and certainly has been and will continue to be part of our Battlefield experience over time. And so really, when we think about designing and building these things, we start with a player first, and we start with what are the motivations they're trying to fulfill. And then we look to build tools that seamlessly and without friction, fulfill those motivations for them in the best way possible. And what we are seeing is that we're able to fulfill motivations across that full spectrum of cohorts, and that's why our network is growing so rapidly. That's why our engagement is continuing to be strong, and that's why people are spending more time in our games and using this as a platform to build deep enduring connections with their friends. Again, entertainment has been built on the creation of world, the development of character telling the story since time began, and we've experienced it in different forms over time, we had to go to the theater, then we would read about it, then we listened to it on the radio and then we watch it the movie, then we watch it in television. Now we experienced that through games. And it is how we entertain ourselves first and foremost, as we think about these great storytelling opportunities. And so again, as a publicly-traded company, we're always thinking about the financial return of the things that we do. But as we think about the full breadth of the consumption of sports and entertainment, these deep social experiences are very much about how we enjoy attainment, but the creation of world and development character and telling of stories is kind of the central life blood of entertainment more broadly. And as we think about this, it's not just about predictability because, again, there are being crappy worlds and crappy characters and story is being told. And so we work with our partners and we work with our own IP to do things in a truly compelling way, and we think it represents an extraordinary business opportunity as we don't believe humanity is going to turn it back on the nature of storytelling. As we look to the future, the nature of storytelling is almost certainly going to be interactive. And on The Sims, again, it's nearly 10 years old now. I mean there are people who are going to want to play The Sims 4 -- yes it's nearly 10 years old now. When we think about -- there's a bunch of people who want to play that game who may not have even been born when we launch the game. And while we have a community of many tens of millions of people playing, we recognize the opportunity to really open up and bringing anyone who wants to experience The Sims 4. As we look to the last 12 months, about 90% of all revenue was from extra content, not the base game. And so as we think about the future, as we think about the evolution of The Sims experience and really bringing in more people to enjoy what The Sims offers the playing community. We felt that this was the right time. And I commend the team for really making this happen and really supporting their community. And what we've seen on balance is the community has been very thankful for this, very supportive of this and is looking forward to welcoming what we hope is many millions more into that ecosystem overall. Yes, it's a really good question, and I appreciate you using Sims as an example, but I think the question is probably broader than just The Sims. And I would say that there's not a one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Certainly, as we think about some of our iterative titles that we do each and every year, our objective is to build enough content and enough innovation and enough creativity that delivers extraordinary value for the amount that our community invest in each of those titles. And we have been very successful in doing that, and we commit many hundreds of people on those franchises to ensure that we deliver all of those things, particularly value to our community, to fulfill the expectations they have for what a new title would bring. We have other things like the titles that come out of BioWare that really is about giving them time to build out these worlds and create these characters and tell these stories in a new innovative and creative way. Without using The Sims as an example, but using things like Skate as a potential example and maybe others in our franchise, there's also an opportunity, in some cases, to have an existing experience continue while layering in a new modality of that experience on top. And certainly, what we're going to see with Skate is you're going to be able to get in there and you're going to be able to skate and do all the things that we've been able to do in Skate games in the past. But there's a whole new modality around creation and social connection, that's going to be a meaningful part of that game going forward. And so to answer your question, I think that we're looking at every franchise in its own stead, and we're asking ourselves, what is the right thing to do with respect to this franchise. Some for our iterative franchise is about getting just the right amount of people into a team to deliver innovation and creativity, for some like our BioWare franchise is about giving time to really build out these worlds characters and story lines. And for other franchises like Skate, and certainly, as we think about the future of Sims, it's how do we hold on to all of the goodness of the existing franchise and layer in new modalities and extensions of how you play these games for a growing and changing and evolving diverse community around the world. Yes. So first thing I would say just to differentiate there. I think what we have had is EA Originals, which were lower-priced titles. This was an initiative that we developed some years ago really to support the India community and the industry growth opportunity overall. What we were seeing in the industry was these India developers were kind of building these very cool games. They didn't have the means to get into market in a big way and they didn't have the ability to continue on because the business model wasn't working for them at least for their first title. And what we did at that time was go into the community and say, \"All right, let's handpick some really great teams who are building some really cool games around really cool IP. Let's help -- let's fund development for them. Let's get them distribution and let's give them the profits on the back end so that they can come together and build an even bigger game a second time around. Most of those have been smaller, lower-priced titles. However, in the history and -- I mean the company 22 years, we have a long and rich history of co-developing, co-publishing and distributing AAA full-priced IP, all the way back for as long as I can remember. We don't do as much of it anymore just because there's not as much of it out there that we think really fits the bill and is it a AAA quality bar that we believe can deliver against the expectations of these global communities at a full price point. We think Wild Heart is one. I mean I would tell you, it started with what felt like a pretty small idea for us internally. And every time we saw the product, we were wowed and mesmerized by what they were doing. The Monster Hunter genre is a relatively new genre. It exploded. It is ripe for innovation and creativity and expansion and what we see the team doing is all of the things that the community is asking for in the genre. And so -- and the response so far has been really, really strong. And so I don't want to get out over my skis on this one. But I would tell you, I saw it. I think it's incredible. The community has seen it, they think it's incredible. How big it can be. We don't quite know yet, but I think there's a path for this to be a really, really cool opportunity for us, for the development team and for the community at large. Yes. Let me grab the first part around World Cup, and then I'll let Chris speak to kind of engagement trends and those types of things around Apex. First, I might challenge the idea that we had troubles with the World Cup last time. But I might be base front. Again, I think we brought in and brought back about 12 million players back into the franchise with World Cup content. It was one of our highest engagement opportunities of that year. I think there may have been externally some expectations on higher revenue at that time. What you might remember we talked about was we believed it was a really strong engagement opportunity. We use it to bring people into the franchise and back to the franchise and we projected and predicted that it would drive growth in the out years beyond the World Cup. And of course, that has happened each and every year since that World Cup. So we feel really, really bullish on what this World Cup can do for us. What I would say without going into broad details, it is more deeply integrated into the mode. It was more kind of an add-on adjunct to the product. Last time it was very cool. It was great content. It was World Cup. What we -- what the team has done this time is we take that content and embed it more deeply into the overall experience of the game. And our expectation is that while it will bring people into the franchise and back to the franchise, it will also drive even deeper engagement over time. And we think that is good for the long-term prospects of the product, particularly as we launch FC next year to build and grow that community to its absolute greatest possible point at this juncture is a great opportunity for us. But today, I was going to say the same thing. Thank you to all for being with us today."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChris Evenden: Thank you. Welcome to EA's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Chris Suh, our CFO; and Laura Miele, our COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted detailed earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript. With regards to our calendar, our Q2 fiscal 2023 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, November 1st. As a reminder, we post the schedule of our entire fiscal year of upcoming earnings calls on our IR website. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today.

During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks Chris. It\u2019s great to be here with you all. We delivered a strong performance across our business in Q1. Our broad IP portfolio, our amazing talent, and our growing network of players deeply engaged in our live services all serve as unique structural advantages, especially as we navigate the fluidity of the macro environment. While we recognize there is more uncertainty in the market, our teams are focused on what they do best, delivering amazing games and services that keep our players engaged, connected, and inspired as we take entertainment and play to the next level. Our portfolio of sports and owned IP franchises continues to power resilience and longevity in our business. EA SPORTS & Racing is a growth center, with franchises that are at the heart of how sports fandom is becoming increasingly interactive. F1 22 sales are up double-digits launch to-date, as the sport continues to boom, especially with younger fans. Our EA SPORTS FIFA franchise is exceptionally strong on a global basis, with record business for Q1 in Asia, significant growth in mobile with DAUs up another 10% over last quarter, and FUT engagement growing nearly 40% year-over-year, which is well above the industry average. We\u2019re going from strength-to-strength in EA SPORTS, including Madden NFL 23 just weeks away, and our most expansive FIFA game ever coming this fall. Sports is the ultimate evergreen form of entertainment, and our new cross-media partnership with LaLiga perfectly illustrates how we continue to innovate at the forefront of sport, media, and interactive content. With these multi-faceted collaborations, we are able bring the most authentic experiences to fans and expand into new ways to watch, create, compete, connect and participate in sport -- across platforms, business models, and geographies. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Apex Legends is a leading multi-platform franchise, with our live service on console and PC driving massive ongoing engagement and a new mobile game that is delivering on our early expectations. Engagement in our Sims franchise is also outperforming the market with content that resonates for a broad and diverse audience. We have a proven ability to grow successful long-term live services across our portfolio with ongoing engagement that drives resiliency, reoccurring revenue and lifetime value for our business. Through all of these experiences, our large global network has grown to nearly 600 million. Every day, our players are forging new friendships and social connections. And with the scale of our network and our team's ability to utilize our data, we can understand where, how and what our audiences are playing today and where they want to go next. We continue to see Gen Alpha and Gen Z turning to games as their primary form of entertainment, consuming more content than any generation of the past. They love playing with friends, they stay connected with family and they're creating content at every turn, both in and around their entire gaming experience, whether they play games from our expansive EA SPORTS portfolio to fuel their fandom, enjoy the intensity and competition of Apex Legends, or seek adventure in games such as Star Wars Jedi, the next generations of consumers use the power of play to fully immerse and express themselves, to build deeper, more meaningful connections with the communities they identify with and where they feel they belong. They're using games like the Sims to unleash their personal and creative autonomy, building characters and new stories with their friends. Delivering games that fuel creativity where players can join, compete and interact with each other through social and immersive experiences is an exciting growth lever for Electronic Arts, as we continue to expand and diversify our portfolio and build global online communities spanning more geographies. Games are the social networks of the future. Leading in this highly competitive market requires a strong focus on people. We continue to invest in our culture and in fueling our talent pipeline. The best character artists, animators, graphic designers, data scientists, engineers and many more talent creators are all joining our team to level up their careers with award winning franchises and studios. From career development and wellness programs to workplace experiences and technology that inspires collaboration and innovation, we strive to make Electronic Arts a great place to work and grow. Through our IP, our talent and our growing network of players, we are adding strength and long-term value to our business. Even with short-term uncertainties, interactive entertainment will continue to evolve and grow, and we are in a very strong position. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Suh: Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, we had another strong quarter driven by continued healthy engagement from our vast player network across our broad portfolio of live services and games. Net bookings for the first quarter exceeded our expectations, coming in at $1.3 billion, driven by our FIFA franchise and the F1 22 launch. Compared to the prior year, net bookings were down 3% or 1% in constant currency, driven by two game launches last year compared to one this year, offset by strength in the FIFA franchise, the acquisition of Playdemic and the launch of Apex Legends Mobile. Our live services net bookings grew 8% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, again, demonstrating the resiliency of the highly reoccurring revenue stream. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 73% of our business. And with regard to full game sales, digital sales accounted for 65% of units sold through, up four percentage points from last year. We delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.77 billion, also above our expectations. And with the higher mix of console-based revenue, gross margins and underlying profit were also well above our expectations. We saw strength across the entire FIFA franchise during the quarter, particularly with FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. FIFA Online 4 hit new high engagement and FIFA Mobile delivered its biggest net bookings quarter ever. FIFA 22 is the largest FIFA ever, life to date with regard to net bookings. F1 2022 net bookings also materially outperformed our expectations, and the franchise has become a dependable driver of growth, having delivered double-digit growth for each of the last four years. Andrew highlighted the success of our owned-IP games, exemplified by Apex Legends, which saw double-digit net bookings growth again in Q1. Apex Legends Mobile had a successful launch during the quarter, making Apex Legends a leading multi-platform global franchise. Operating expenses were up 11% on last year, in line with our expectations, as we continue to invest in our development teams and new product launches. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $78 million, and we returned a further $373 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Turning now to guidance. We are maintaining our full year net bookings guidance of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% year-on-year, or 8% to 11% in constant currency. Let me give a bit more color within this range. First, based on current exchange rates, we see nearly $100 million of incremental net bookings headwind within our full year guidance, or about one point of growth, which mostly impacts the second half of our year. As rates remain quite volatile, we will provide a more current update in our Q2 earnings call about the expected half two impact. Second, we\u2019re seeing some shifts within our business. We expect the strong Q1 results in our EA SPORTS and Racing portfolio to continue, offsetting the anticipated impact of an overall softer mobile market. This mix shift has a positive benefit to gross margins, and therefore minimizes the likely increased impact of FX on our underlying profitability. We expect fiscal 2023 GAAP revenue to be $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion and cost of revenue to be $2.02 billion to $2.065 billion. Our expectations for operating expenses are unchanged, at $4.2 billion to $4.315 billion, and we anticipate earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.87. Our guidance for operating cash flow also remains unchanged, at $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the quarter, we expect Q2 fiscal 2023 net bookings to be $1.725 to $1.775 billion, driven by the launch of Madden 23 on August 19 and FIFA 23 on September 30. Both Madden and FIFA benefit from having built decades-long relationships with their passionate player communities and broader sports ecosystems, and we\u2019re seeing strong pre-launch momentum for these reliably well-performing titles. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, cost of revenue to be $467 million to $480 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.036 billion to $1.041 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.86 for the quarter. Our strong first quarter reflects the continued healthy engagement from our vast player network across our broad portfolio. We're confident in our ability to execute with discipline, navigating through a more uneven market with a robust half two slate, and the durable power of our live services model to deliver continued growth in fiscal 2023. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. It's been a good start to the year. While the macro outlook remains fluid, every one of us at Electronic Arts is focused on the things we can control. Even amidst market uncertainty, more people than ever before are turning to games as the primary choice for entertainment. This is what they love to do more than anything else, and it's how they want to connect and share experiences with people around the world. With gaming so central to our lives today, EA is uniquely well positioned with a broad demographic reach of our portfolio and the strongest content pipeline in our history. Leveraging the talent of the best teams in the industry, we are poised to lead this next chapter of entertainment and to continue building long-term value in our company. As we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I want to take a moment to welcome Laura Miele. As Chief Operating Officer, Laura has a deep connection to our business from game creation and our studios to revenue generation and our commercial organization. Laura will join us to add her strategic perspective and insights on the business. Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Hope everyone in the team is well. Maybe two big picture questions, if I can, Andrew. First, with where we are in the console cycle and how there still continues to be a lot of supply chain and logistic challenges globally, can you talk a little bit about your current thinking on this console cycle versus historical precedents and how you plan on sort of building the organization on the content side to [line] (ph) when we get to sort of mass deployment of the next-generation of consoles? Would love your view on that first. And then obviously, on the mobile gaming side, we continue to see a lot of challenges on distribution and go-to-market and monetization. Can you talk a little bit about your efforts to realign the organization for this sort of new world order for mobile and how you think about capitalizing on that opportunity over the next couple of years? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. Thanks, Eric. Two great questions. I'm going to get a bunch I'm going to hand off to Laura a little bit on mobile structure. She's been working very closely with the team on how we're thinking about that future. In terms of console cycle, first, we're still really early in this console cycle. So our expectation, typically, our console partners think about console cycles on a 10-year time horizon. And so we're still really early. And while there are some supply chain constraints, I think what we're hearing from our partners is that we feel like they're going to ease up towards the back half and certainly into next year. But the most important thing that we're seeing is demand is off the charts. And I think we heard Microsoft say they're in as good a position as they've ever been in terms of their console sales and their console demand. And we also know that Sony consoles are in deep demand. And as the supply chain starts to ease, our expectation is that more and more people pick up that next console. So as we think about what is the next 8 years of this cycle, you should expect that we'll continue to invest deeply in our existing owned IP in our EA SPORTS portfolio, but you should also expect that as we get through that cycle, we're investing deeper into our slate to have a stronger pipeline down the back half of the cycle. And the good news about that for gamers is when we have a cycle that goes for this long and we're able to invest on this time horizon, the quality of the software and the nature of the experience we are able to deliver gets better every single year. And so, we're looking at this in the same way we have in the past. Now I think your next question on mobile is also a really important one, because what we also know, as these cycles continue, is mobile plays a big part, PC continues to play a big part. Over time, cloud gaming will also play a big part. And so, we're layering other mechanisms for this global community of 3.5 billion people who currently play games to interact with the content and services we provide. At a macro level, mobile continues to be the world's largest gaming platform, 3.5 billion people. It's hard to imagine any other platform having that kind of reach. For us, we also see that it gives us reach in markets where we typically haven't been as strong. And as we've talked about, our FIFA mobile business growing on mobile, we've actually seen the majority of that growth happened in markets where typically we have not been able to monetize that experience in the same way, given the limited penetration of consoles or the premium model in those markets. So long term, we continue to believe that mobile is going to represent an incredibly strong opportunity for us, for -- on a global basis, about 50% of the gaming industry, it's about 17% of our business. So that represents tremendous upside for us. And so what Laura has really been working with the team on, particularly with our most recent acquisitions, is how can we build one single mobile organization that's really targeted at the future, a future where brands really matter, network really matters and incredible teams really matter. And I'd hand off to Laura to add a little bit more detail.\nLaura Miele: Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Eric, for the question. We have successfully integrated Glu and Playdemic into business into one mobile organization that is actually seeing growth year-over-year, and we continue to expect to see that in the coming years. As Andrew mentioned, there's an outside strategic value that mobile brings to our portfolio. It has a significant contribution and impact on the ecosystems of our big franchises. So one example, we've discussed the success of FIFA Mobile. And when we look at our player profile, 46% of our FIFA mobile players were located in Asia Pacific and Latin America compared to just 28% for our HD players. So we see this as a significant expansion of the overall ecosystem for these big brands that we have. It's also an amazing entry point for one of the largest growth drivers for us with Gen Z and Gen Alpha players. And of course, as Andrew mentioned, it's a dominant engagement platform for emerging markets. And then as we think about cross-platform play also for our franchises. So we are optimistic, not just about the individual mobile business, but the strategic impact mobile brings to our overall growth plans that we have for the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on Chris' commentary for a softer mobile market in the back half. I think that's how I heard it. Can you maybe just walk through some of the drivers of that? Is that something specifically in your pipeline or is that more related to broader factors like the economy or UA challenges at some of the platforms?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I think we're seeing some macro mobile slowdown, at least that's what we're hearing about. Our model establishes -- is built on a basis that we'll see some slowdown in the macro mobile market. Again, our mobile business on balance is doing very well inside of this. And so we're confident in our core business. And we're confident in our core franchises. But we are seeing kind of a macro slowdown. I think there's, probably a few different reasons for that. One is I think the market is still working through IDFA and how to deal with that. Again, in a world that we have brands that matter and a strong network of players an incredible technology. We feel like that we're able to navigate that very well. Two, I think we're dealing with some tough COVID comps, mobile benefited greatly through COVID. And three, if you've traveled it all over the summer, I think the world is on vacation. And so if you speak to any of the travel companies, they will tell you they're seeing unprecedented levels of travel. And I think that might also have some impact. Long-term, though, when we come back to this, it represents 3.5 billion players. It represents a way for us to access players in markets that our traditional does not. We think that the future is going to lend itself to big important entertainment brands and brands that exist across platforms. And we think the overall ecosystem will be strong. And so, while we never want to go into a market overly confident. We always want to use strong discipline with how we plan for the market. We're confident in our business. But even as we hear about some softness in the market, we just want to account for that as we move into the second half of the year.\nDavid Karnovsky: Okay. Maybe I can just also follow up with one about economic risk more broadly. I think we've tended to think historically PC console games is kind of recession resistant just given the cup cost on a per hour basis of the content. But wondering, how you think that kind of dynamic holds up today, just given the industry has shifted so much towards live services, but then also increasing player engagement for things like subscription. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. I think it's a great question. Typically, as we've looked through past macro challenges, our industry has done extremely well relative to everything else that's going on around it, even relative to other forms of entertainment. There's, a few reasons for that. One, it's highly interactive and it's deeply engaging and represents extraordinary value for money. Two, entertainment is kind of a fundamental human need. And even as humanity is dealt with many challenges through its course, entertainment has always risen to the top is something that has brought us together. As we think about the business now versus the last macro challenges that we may have faced, I think the good news with live services is that we have more people engaging in our games for more time and more deeply connected to each other. All of those things speak to, I think, real strength of the nature of the live service business that we operate in today. I think there is one open question if we were to have one which is in a world where you can engage deeply without spending, how we will see spending through this period, in the connects of live services. What I said in the prepared remarks is, what we're focused on is the things that we can really control, which is driving deep engagement, because what we know about engagement in our business, particularly in the context of our live services, is over the lifetime of an experience. If we can, continue to drive really strong engagement across the portfolio and across our $600 million strong community, but the lifetime that we protected overtime.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Hey, great. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions here. The first one, probably for Laura, but just generally, COVID obviously impacted the way people played gains, but it also impacted greatly how games were being made. We've seen a ton of -- a lot of delays in the industry. Where do you think we're at? Are we to a point where delays will become fewer and fewer? Like how do you feel about making games today in the current environment?\nLaura Miele: Hi Andrew, thanks for the question, really great question. A couple of things. Yes, we did see initially some disruptions in how our teams make games. But I will say, and I've said so many times, I am just blown away by the ingenuity and creativity of our teams and how they have adapted to get to not only a more productive place but a highly creative place and how they're creating games. And so we've seen a lot of progress actually in how the rhythm and how our teams have created operating systems and processes around how to create games. And that said, we are seeing more people come back to the office. We are here in our office and our headquarters right now in person. And so -- and we've been traveling around visiting studios. Andrew was in the UK last week visiting our Racing teams there. So we're seeing more people come back. And we're also seeing people adapt to productivity and environments that are more meaningful and productive for them and for their creativity. So I would say that what we've learned is that having people and teams in place in the beginning of a production cycle for development. And then usually, at the end as we final has become critical. And our teams have adapted incredibly well on the production side, sometimes it's more meaningful for them to be in the office together and sometimes they are more productive from home. So we're seeing a really strong adaptation to how the teams are developing. So we believe we are in our new rhythm, and we're continuing to evolve that as time goes on. We also have seen a really strong demand in people joining our company. People choose to work with companies that they have a strong value and moral attachments to as well as clearly compensation is really important, but people really want to have a connection emotional and personal connection to where they are. And we've seen a really strong demand and desire to work here. So we're seeing a really good options for us to bring new talent in, and we're seeing our teams and infrastructure adapt to a new work environment.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. No, I really appreciate that color, Laura. Switching over to thinking about medium to long-term growth. You guys, I believe, I mean, you've announced or we've speculated that there's quite a few single player games coming. How should we think about growth from that vector? Should these be bigger in scale, so that they'll each kind of comp one after another nicely, or is it a quantity game where you launch one big one, and then we get a couple after that. How should we think about comping the single player games going forward as we build our models over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah. And maybe Chris could add some detail on the model. The way we think about this is really less about, which game and more about, which motivations to these games fulfill. So we know about our players is on balance, they have these call motivations, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, self-improvement, creation, these things that bring us together as players of games. And the creation of worlds and the building of characters and the telling of stories is really important in the fulfillment of some of those motivations. So when we think about our portfolio and we think about building it out, we really think about it on two key vectors. One, how can we tell incredible stories and two, how can we build tremendous online communities and then how do we bring those two things together. So the way -- when you look at our portfolio, what you should be looking for is how are we doing that? How we build in these worlds and telling new stories, how we're developing global online communities and how we're bringing those two things together for the fulfillment of motivations. And what we see when we get that is one, we grow network until we grow the amount of time that plays in our network spend in and around our games. And as we think about single-player games, we think it's a really, really important part of the overall portfolio that we deliver in the fulfillment of those core motivations. And the way we'll plan for it over time is really just looking at our community and looking at how they're spending their time and looking at where motivations may or may not be fulfilled and we'll look to supplement that with the addition of new online games, new multi-player games and new single-player games.\nChris Suh: Yes, Andrew. And maybe if I could just add on top of that. Andrew, our Andrew here explained it well. But as we think about the model impact and the financial impact of that. I mean, I think the first thing to always keep in mind is that live services still encompasses on a trailing 12-month basis, over 70% of our business. And that has been a proven very reliable, highly reoccurring revenue stream, and that will still be the predominant driver in our P&L long term.  Second, we've talked a lot about the areas of investment that we're making, and that's both in the live service as well as some of the single title launches that you've seen. And so over the course of time, we'll continue to invest in our long-term growth. We'll continue to invest in the ongoing stable performance of our live services business, and there'll be some puts and takes along the way.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. You mentioned that Apex Legends Mobile was successful versus your expectations. And I wanted to double-click on that. By what measures would you consider Apex Legends Mobile launch successful? And is bookings one of those measures? And then have you launched Apex Legends Mobile in all the geographies that you've intended? And how should we think about the second half advertising intensity of Apex Legends Mobile compared to what we've seen so far, especially in light of your comments on a weaker mobile environment in the second half. And then I have a follow-up.\nLaura Miele: Hi, Mark. Well, first, yes, we are pleased with the launch of the game that met our expectations for the quarter. And what we saw with Apex Legends on console, as we all know, is it was a massive uptake in the beginning and then followed by stabilization and really steady growth over the life cycle of the game, and we expect the same of this title on mobile. And in fact, this is the pattern seen by many mobile shooters. There are many years of revenue and return generation to be had, particularly when you look at the shooter category and we expect the same thing to be true for Apex mobile. And keep in mind, we are currently in week eight. So many years ahead, and we are in week eight, just getting started. One thing we know is we're very good at listening to our community, and we know how to respond to the needs of players and then the game dynamics that are required to respond. And keep in mind as well, we have an incredible team on this. We have Respawn, who is just best-in-class in the business for shooters. We have a meaningful mobile infrastructure now to execute globally with the additions of Glu and Playdemic and our mobile organization. And we also have an exceptional partnership with Tencent. So we are -- we've met our expectations. We're encouraged and we also know we have a significant runway ahead of us on this title. As it relates to advertising, we are again, looking at advertising as a dimension of our mobile business, though this is one that is primarily going to be focused on the internal game monetization. And that's how we're looking at the optimization of return on our investment in Apex.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. I guess in the context of this weakening mobile macro environment for the second half, and kind of a stable expense guide. Does your stable expense guide assume more or less or the same investment in mobile user acquisition?\nLaura Miele: For Apex, we are -- it is -- we're holding it steady. So we are not changing our outlook on our investment or the return. So we're holding that for now. But again, as we -- the great thing about the mobile business is it's quite dynamic, and we're able to use multiple levers as it relates to game changes, evaluate engagement and evaluate the return that we're seeing. But at this time, we aren't changing our outlook on our investment or the revenue return that we get from that.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. And just a quickie again on Apex Legends PC console this time. Does your guide for the full year include any kind of effect from competition of new shooters that may be launching this fall.\nAndrew Wilson: No. The way I would think about that, Omar, is that our guide takes into account what we view as the overall market conditions, Apex Legends had double-digit growth again in Q1. We're anticipating the full year to continue to grow on that very important franchise, and it does take into account both the things that we control from an execution standpoint as well as what we view as the market conditions, and that's all factored into the guidance that you heard.\nOmar Dessouky: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking questions. Just a follow-up on Apex. With the mobile game coming out mid-quarter, did it have any impact, if any, on the console PC version in terms of bookings and users? In other words, the growth kind of pickup or slowdown post the mobile launch?\nLaura Miele: Hi, Mario, thanks for the question. It's so early to be candid. But what we are seeing is we are seeing tens of millions of new players coming into Apex, and we're seeing a significant impact in geographies and growth in geographies as far as penetration of the brand and the experience that are expanding the Apex brand in places that the high def and PC console didn't necessarily. So it's, again, more expansion into emerging markets. and a lot of new players coming into the brand that we're optimistic about. But it's early days for us to understand to see how things will play out. We have a new season coming on the high def and PC game in about a few weeks here. And so we will study and understand the impact that mobile has had on that. So more to come in our next earnings potentially on the context around the impact on the overall business.\nMario Lu: Great. That's helpful. And just one on FIFA. You guys mentioned the whole franchise was strong during the quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove the strength in FIFA Online? And then, can you guys remind us, once the FIFA license rolls off, like what happens to these kind of persistent games like FIFA Online and FIFA mobile? Is it just a simple kind of rename or how is that going to work? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So I'll have Laura take the first part on just the performance in the quarter and then I'll talk a little bit more broadly about, how we think about the franchise going forward.\nLaura Miele: Yes. So on FIFA Online, 4 performance, the studio has studied and strongly focused for the last few years on efforts to improve the gameplay feel. And this has really started to pay off in player sentiment. So we continue to deepen our relationship with our players, and we have strong partners as we go to market in Asia and we're factoring the feedback into the game development. We're also seeing improved marketing and the growth of popularity of Global Football in Korea, which has had a big impact on the business.\nAndrew Wilson: And more broadly, as we said, we're going to launch the most expensive FIFA ever this year. I think it's extraordinary in demand is really strong. I was I was just in Europe, but I was bumping into young kids, and they'd find out I was doing that already preordered FIFA, which was extraordinary. I think we're seeing growth in the sport. Of course, we've got a World Cup here. And so our belief is that this is going to be a very strong year for our FIFA business. What -- the way that -- and without going broadly into the mechanics of our relationship with FIFA contracts or what have you, what you should expect is that we will launch the most expansive FIFA ever, we will then continue to sell that in the market and we have the ability to continue to do that. And then, we will begin launching the EA SPORTS FC brand more deliberately and more broadly in the market, beyond, again, what we did earlier this year, where we had nearly 200 of our 300 partners came out and promoted the EA SPORTS FC brand as a brand that we all collectively own, the 300 partners, Electronic Arts and our community of many hundreds of millions of players around the world. And so, while the name of the game will change the nature of the experience and the connection that players have to the game, to the leagues and teams they love and to the players they play with and play against in the community, that's many hundreds of men strong. None of that changes. We'll invest strongly into that and we're very excited about what that future will bring. And again, we announced our new LaLiga partnership which is going to expand on the nature of things we can do. And you remember, as we've talked about this through, we have been deeply grateful for our partnership with FIFA, which has existed for nearly 30 years, and we've built a tremendous business together. But we've been very excited in every conversation we've had about the types of things we're going to be able to do with our partners and for our community in the context of the blurring of the lines of football fandom between linear and interactive, what we do in the virtual world, and what we do in the real world, what we watch on television, what we experience in game and what we've announced with LaLiga is just the first step of that. And you should imagine that we'll continue to build and expand on this opportunity to truly bring together, what is the largest global football community around a brand that we all own together EA SPORTS FC.\nMario Lu: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nEric Handler: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. I am wondering, if you could talk about two franchises. First, with F1 showing growth on a year-over-year basis, this is your second year now with the title. Anything you're doing differently from a marketing perspective to -- or just a game perspective to drive the improved numbers there? And then secondly, with regards to the Sims, I think you just had your first expansion pack in about a year, maybe talk about what's been going on there?\nLaura Miele: Sorry. Thanks, Eric. There's a question I was muted there. We remain incredibly bullish and excited about the F1 business. And I would say that the development teams have integrated well into Electronic Arts. And I think that they're seeing some of the benefits of our scale globally. And certainly, when you look at our marketing and commercial divisions, I mean, we've had some of the developers actually comment and note the global footprint and reach and impact they've been able to have through our presence that we have with our marketing teams, commercial teams and commercial partnerships that they just haven't been able to benefit from before. So we're seeing strong development impact from the leadership we have here probably mostly in this year's release, and we are very optimistic about some of the dimensions of the game that we're going to bring to market in the years ahead. And then just the strength EA SPORTS brand and the really strong marketing and commercial teams that we have. And for the Sims question, you mentioned, so we -- one of my favorite things about the Sims business is how healthy and strong it is. We actually released game packs, content and expansion packs several a year. So we are persistently connected to our players in that community. And we are pretty excited about how strong and the size of this business after about 10 years. We've had the Sims 4 brand out. So this is something that we persistently put content into the player community, and we'll continue to do that for the years to come.\nEric Handler: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nMike Hickey: Hi, Andrew, Chris, Laura, Chris, congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions.\nChris Suh: Thanks Mike.\nMike Hickey: Two questions. No problem. First question, sort of, broad ranging here, but really exciting news, at least for me. And I think the community on state and your decision, your team's decision to move from a premium plus live service release to what it looks like a pure free play live service. So just curious, qualitative or quantitative, the decision-making process to move from what was, I think, kind of highly anticipated premium launch to a pure free-to-play there's a quality level or a unit expectation that is part of the process there to move to pure free-to-play. And if this is maybe the beginning of seeing this in other genres, those lower tier sports games that three million to five million units, whether it's auto racing or MMA then maybe better live services in this market versus premium? I have a follow-up. Thanks guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yeah, great question. I'll start, and then I'll hand over to Laura, who's been working deeply with the team. The first thing, as I was saying earlier, we really see growth in our future built on two key vectors; one, the ability to create worlds and characters and tell stories and that was to build really large global online communities. When we look at Skate, I think what's happened is our ambitions have continued to grow. As you've seen what the team has been able to do around that experience, I think we continue to see opportunity. Skateboarding is kind of a cultural language for many generations. It transcends so many things, certainly geography and as we think about the ability to bring a global community of youth together through the language of skateboarding. We think this represents one of the biggest and strongest opportunities we have to build a global online community, deeply engaged in a world that involves creativity both from us and from them experiencing what starts out as skateboarding and almost certainly reaches more deeply into the cultural sensibilities of a generation. So as we thought about that, we really took a step back and evaluated how best we deliver that. And Laura has been working with the teams on how they've thought through that puzzle.\nLaura Miele: So, one of the most important growth potential that we have as a company is how we show up for Gen Z and Gen Alpha players, how they socially connect, how they consume content. So there's been a significant focus from the team on this. And I'll talk about the team for a minute. We have some of the original creative leaders from the original Skate franchise. So, much of the DNA and goodness that people loved about skate exists in the team. And then, we also brought in someone Daniel McCulloch, who ran at the Xbox Live platform. So he deeply understands art and nuance of social connection, social engagement and how to nurture a community. And third, I think that Skate, back in the day Skate was a bit even ahead of its time. It was a lot of the core motivation around our Skate experience was around creative self-expression in social connection and competition. And we are bringing that to life in the biggest way we possibly can. So, more to come on this. We are in community testing now, we're very close to this skate community to get feedback, and we're pretty optimistic about how we're going to be coming to market soon.\nMike Hickey: Nice. Thanks, Andrew, Laura. A second question, Andrew, a bit awkward here, but bear with me. The sort of subsequent your last call, there was a media article that came out sort of related to consolidation and sort of frame you as persistently pursuing a sale, which was, I think, kind of somewhat unsettling or at least puzzling to the investment community, our clients and you get a lot of questions on it. So, just curious, if you can sort of provide some framework around that or clarification or sort of your motivation to run a stand-alone company or otherwise? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: First, I'm sure you don't expect me to comment on rumors and speculation from some small red media outlets, but be that as it may. I would tell you, I think we are in an incredible position. We're soon to be the largest stand-alone independent developer and publisher of interactive entertainment in the world. I think we have the most incredible teams in our industry and the plan, as Laura spoke to earlier. We're attracting more and more incredible creative talent. We have a community that's $600 million strong that is growing and certainly, we're well on our way to aspirations of being able to engage a billion people in play across the planet. I think we're growing across platforms. We're growing across business models, and we're growing across geographies. And in a world where gaming is becoming more important to the lives of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who will be the leading generation in terms of consumption, entertainment for the future, I don't think we could be in a stronger position as a stand-alone company. Our objective always and my objective as CEO of this company is always to take care of our people, our players, and our shareholders. And should there ever be a way for us to do that differently the way we're doing it today, I, of course, have to be open to that. But I would tell you today, we feel very, very confident and excited for our future.\nMike Hickey: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Creutz: Hey thanks. Since the last conference call, you guys announced Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Your fiscal Q4 big IP title is still unspecified in your current guidance. I'm just wondering if -- since you've announced Star Wars, do we assume that, therefore, that isn't the Star Wars game or should we not assume anything?\nAndrew Wilson: I think the advice would be do not assume anything. We will name the titles and fill in the blanks at the appropriate time.\nDoug Creutz: Okay. Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Thanks Doug.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Miele",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, Eric, for the question. We have successfully integrated Glu and Playdemic into business into one mobile organization that is actually seeing growth year-over-year, and we continue to expect to see that in the coming years. As Andrew mentioned, there's an outside strategic value that mobile brings to our portfolio. It has a significant contribution and impact on the ecosystems of our big franchises. So one example, we've discussed the success of FIFA Mobile. And when we look at our player profile, 46% of our FIFA mobile players were located in Asia Pacific and Latin America compared to just 28% for our HD players. So we see this as a significant expansion of the overall ecosystem for these big brands that we have. It's also an amazing entry point for one of the largest growth drivers for us with Gen Z and Gen Alpha players. And of course, as Andrew mentioned, it's a dominant engagement platform for emerging markets. And then as we think about cross-platform play also for our franchises. So we are optimistic, not just about the individual mobile business, but the strategic impact mobile brings to our overall growth plans that we have for the future. Hi Andrew, thanks for the question, really great question. A couple of things. Yes, we did see initially some disruptions in how our teams make games.

So there's been a significant focus from the team on this. And I'll talk about the team for a minute. We have some of the original creative leaders from the original Skate franchise. So, much of the DNA and goodness that people loved about skate exists in the team. And then, we also brought in someone Daniel McCulloch, who ran at the Xbox Live platform. So he deeply understands art and nuance of social connection, social engagement and how to nurture a community. And third, I think that Skate, back in the day Skate was a bit even ahead of its time. It was a lot of the core motivation around our Skate experience was around creative self-expression in social connection and competition. And we are bringing that to life in the biggest way we possibly can. So, more to come on this. We are in community testing now, we're very close to this skate community to get feedback, and we're pretty optimistic about how we're going to be coming to market soon."

            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew said, we had another strong quarter driven by continued healthy engagement from our vast player network across our broad portfolio of live services and games. Net bookings for the first quarter exceeded our expectations, coming in at $1.3 billion, driven by our FIFA franchise and the F1 22 launch. Compared to the prior year, net bookings were down 3% or 1% in constant currency, driven by two game launches last year compared to one this year, offset by strength in the FIFA franchise, the acquisition of Playdemic and the launch of Apex Legends Mobile. Our live services net bookings grew 8% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, again, demonstrating the resiliency of the highly reoccurring revenue stream. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 73% of our business. And with regard to full game sales, digital sales accounted for 65% of units sold through, up four percentage points from last year. We delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.77 billion, also above our expectations. And with the higher mix of console-based revenue, gross margins and underlying profit were also well above our expectations. We saw strength across the entire FIFA franchise during the quarter, particularly with FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. FIFA Online 4 hit new high engagement and FIFA Mobile delivered its biggest net bookings quarter ever. FIFA 22 is the largest FIFA ever, life to date with regard to net bookings. F1 2022 net bookings also materially outperformed our expectations, and the franchise has become a dependable driver of growth, having delivered double-digit growth for each of the last four years. Andrew highlighted the success of our owned-IP games, exemplified by Apex Legends, which saw double-digit net bookings growth again in Q1. Apex Legends Mobile had a successful launch during the quarter, making Apex Legends a leading multi-platform global franchise. Operating expenses were up 11% on last year, in line with our expectations, as we continue to invest in our development teams and new product launches. Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $78 million, and we returned a further $373 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Turning now to guidance. We are maintaining our full year net bookings guidance of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion, up 5% to 8% year-on-year, or 8% to 11% in constant currency. Let me give a bit more color within this range. First, based on current exchange rates, we see nearly $100 million of incremental net bookings headwind within our full year guidance, or about one point of growth, which mostly impacts the second half of our year. As rates remain quite volatile, we will provide a more current update in our Q2 earnings call about the expected half two impact. Second, we're seeing some shifts within our business. We expect the strong Q1 results in our EA SPORTS and Racing portfolio to continue, offsetting the anticipated impact of an overall softer mobile market. This mix shift has a positive benefit to gross margins, and therefore minimizes the likely increased impact of FX on our underlying profitability. We expect fiscal 2023 GAAP revenue to be $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion and cost of revenue to be $2.02 billion to $2.065 billion. Our expectations for operating expenses are unchanged, at $4.2 billion to $4.315 billion, and we anticipate earnings per share of $2.79 to $2.87. Our guidance for operating cash flow also remains unchanged, at $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. See our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the quarter, we expect Q2 fiscal 2023 net bookings to be $1.725 to $1.775 billion, driven by the launch of Madden 23 on August 19 and FIFA 23 on September 30. Both Madden and FIFA benefit from having built decades-long relationships with their passionate player communities and broader sports ecosystems, and we're seeing strong pre-launch momentum for these reliably well-performing titles. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, cost of revenue to be $467 million to $480 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.036 billion to $1.041 billion. This results in earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.86 for the quarter. Our strong first quarter reflects the continued healthy engagement from our vast player network across our broad portfolio. We're confident in our ability to execute with discipline, navigating through a more uneven market with a robust half two slate, and the durable power of our live services model to deliver continued growth in fiscal 2023. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Andrew. Yes, Andrew. And maybe if I could just add on top of that. Andrew, our Andrew here explained it well. But as we think about the model impact and the financial impact of that. I mean, I think the first thing to always keep in mind is that live services still encompasses on a trailing 12-month basis, over 70% of our business. And that has been a proven very reliable, highly reoccurring revenue stream, and that will still be the predominant driver in our P&L long term.  Second, we've talked a lot about the areas of investment that we're making, and that's both in the live service as well as some of the single title launches that you've seen. And so over the course of time, we'll continue to invest in our long-term growth. We'll continue to invest in the ongoing stable performance of our live services business, and there'll be some puts and takes along the way.\nQ \u2013 Andrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thanks so much. Thanks Mike."

            "content": "Thanks Chris. It's great to be here with you all. We delivered a strong performance across our business in Q1. Our broad IP portfolio, our amazing talent, and our growing network of players deeply engaged in our live services all serve as unique structural advantages, especially as we navigate the fluidity of the macro environment. While we recognize there is more uncertainty in the market, our teams are focused on what they do best, delivering amazing games and services that keep our players engaged, connected, and inspired as we take entertainment and play to the next level. Our portfolio of sports and owned IP franchises continues to power resilience and longevity in our business. EA SPORTS & Racing is a growth center, with franchises that are at the heart of how sports fandom is becoming increasingly interactive. F1 22 sales are up double-digits launch to-date, as the sport continues to boom, especially with younger fans. Our EA SPORTS FIFA franchise is exceptionally strong on a global basis, with record business for Q1 in Asia, significant growth in mobile with DAUs up another 10% over last quarter, and FUT engagement growing nearly 40% year-over-year, which is well above the industry average. We're going from strength-to-strength in EA SPORTS, including Madden NFL 23 just weeks away, and our most expansive FIFA game ever coming this fall. Sports is the ultimate evergreen form of entertainment, and our new cross-media partnership with LaLiga perfectly illustrates how we continue to innovate at the forefront of sport, media, and interactive content. With these multi-faceted collaborations, we are able bring the most authentic experiences to fans and expand into new ways to watch, create, compete, connect and participate in sport -- across platforms, business models, and geographies. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Apex Legends is a leading multi-platform franchise, with our live service on console and PC driving massive ongoing engagement and a new mobile game that is delivering on our early expectations. Engagement in our Sims franchise is also outperforming the market with content that resonates for a broad and diverse audience. We have a proven ability to grow successful long-term live services across our portfolio with ongoing engagement that drives resiliency, reoccurring revenue and lifetime value for our business. Through all of these experiences, our large global network has grown to nearly 600 million. Every day, our players are forging new friendships and social connections. And with the scale of our network and our team's ability to utilize our data, we can understand where, how and what our audiences are playing today and where they want to go next. We continue to see Gen Alpha and Gen Z turning to games as their primary form of entertainment, consuming more content than any generation of the past. They love playing with friends, they stay connected with family and they're creating content at every turn, both in and around their entire gaming experience, whether they play games from our expansive EA SPORTS portfolio to fuel their fandom, enjoy the intensity and competition of Apex Legends, or seek adventure in games such as Star Wars Jedi, the next generations of consumers use the power of play to fully immerse and express themselves, to build deeper, more meaningful connections with the communities they identify with and where they feel they belong. They're using games like the Sims to unleash their personal and creative autonomy, building characters and new stories with their friends. Delivering games that fuel creativity where players can join, compete and interact with each other through social and immersive experiences is an exciting growth lever for Electronic Arts, as we continue to expand and diversify our portfolio and build global online communities spanning more geographies. Games are the social networks of the future. Leading in this highly competitive market requires a strong focus on people. We continue to invest in our culture and in fueling our talent pipeline. The best character artists, animators, graphic designers, data scientists, engineers and many more talent creators are all joining our team to level up their careers with award winning franchises and studios. From career development and wellness programs to workplace experiences and technology that inspires collaboration and innovation, we strive to make Electronic Arts a great place to work and grow. Through our IP, our talent and our growing network of players, we are adding strength and long-term value to our business. Even with short-term uncertainties, interactive entertainment will continue to evolve and grow, and we are in a very strong position. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Thanks, Chris. It's been a good start to the year. While the macro outlook remains fluid, every one of us at Electronic Arts is focused on the things we can control. Even amidst market uncertainty, more people than ever before are turning to games as the primary choice for entertainment. This is what they love to do more than anything else, and it's how they want to connect and share experiences with people around the world. With gaming so central to our lives today, EA is uniquely well positioned with a broad demographic reach of our portfolio and the strongest content pipeline in our history. Leveraging the talent of the best teams in the industry, we are poised to lead this next chapter of entertainment and to continue building long-term value in our company. As we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I want to take a moment to welcome Laura Miele. As Chief Operating Officer, Laura has a deep connection to our business from game creation and our studios to revenue generation and our commercial organization. Laura will join us to add her strategic perspective and insights on the business. Now Chris, Laura and I are here for your questions. Yeah. Thanks, Eric. Two great questions. I'm going to get a bunch I'm going to hand off to Laura a little bit on mobile structure. She's been working very closely with the team on how we're thinking about that future. In terms of console cycle, first, we're still really early in this console cycle. So our expectation, typically, our console partners think about console cycles on a 10-year time horizon. And so we're still really early. And while there are some supply chain constraints, I think what we're hearing from our partners is that we feel like they're going to ease up towards the back half and certainly into next year. But the most important thing that we're seeing is demand is off the charts. And I think we heard Microsoft say they're in as good a position as they've ever been in terms of their console sales and their console demand. And we also know that Sony consoles are in deep demand. And as the supply chain starts to ease, our expectation is that more and more people pick up that next console. So as we think about what is the next 8 years of this cycle, you should expect that we'll continue to invest deeply in our existing owned IP in our EA SPORTS portfolio, but you should also expect that as we get through that cycle, we're investing deeper into our slate to have a stronger pipeline down the back half of the cycle. And the good news about that for gamers is when we have a cycle that goes for this long and we're able to invest on this time horizon, the quality of the software and the nature of the experience we are able to deliver gets better every single year. And so, we're looking at this in the same way we have in the past. Now I think your next question on mobile is also a really important one, because what we also know, as these cycles continue, is mobile plays a big part, PC continues to play a big part. Over time, cloud gaming will also play a big part. And so, we're layering other mechanisms for this global community of 3.5 billion people who currently play games to interact with the content and services we provide. At a macro level, mobile continues to be the world's largest gaming platform, 3.5 billion people. It's hard to imagine any other platform having that kind of reach. For us, we also see that it gives us reach in markets where we typically haven't been as strong. And as we've talked about, our FIFA mobile business growing on mobile, we've actually seen the majority of that growth happened in markets where typically we have not been able to monetize that experience in the same way, given the limited penetration of consoles or the premium model in those markets. So long term, we continue to believe that mobile is going to represent an incredibly strong opportunity for us, for -- on a global basis, about 50% of the gaming industry, it's about 17% of our business. So that represents tremendous upside for us. And so what Laura has really been working with the team on, particularly with our most recent acquisitions, is how can we build one single mobile organization that's really targeted at the future, a future where brands really matter, network really matters and incredible teams really matter. And I'd hand off to Laura to add a little bit more detail. Yes. I think we're seeing some macro mobile slowdown, at least that's what we're hearing about. Our model establishes -- is built on a basis that we'll see some slowdown in the macro mobile market. Again, our mobile business on balance is doing very well inside of this. And so we're confident in our core business. And we're confident in our core franchises. But we are seeing kind of a macro slowdown. I think there's, probably a few different reasons for that. One is I think the market is still working through IDFA and how to deal with that. Again, in a world that we have brands that matter and a strong network of players an incredible technology. We feel like that we're able to navigate that very well. Two, I think we're dealing with some tough COVID comps, mobile benefited greatly through COVID. And three, if you've traveled it all over the summer, I think the world is on vacation. And so if you speak to any of the travel companies, they will tell you they're seeing unprecedented levels of travel. And I think that might also have some impact. Long-term, though, when we come back to this, it represents 3.5 billion players. It represents a way for us to access players in markets that our traditional does not. We think that the future is going to lend itself to big important entertainment brands and brands that exist across platforms. And we think the overall ecosystem will be strong. And so, while we never want to go into a market overly confident. We always want to use strong discipline with how we plan for the market. We're confident in our business. But even as we hear about some softness in the market, we just want to account for that as we move into the second half of the year. Yeah. I think it's a great question. Typically, as we've looked through past macro challenges, our industry has done extremely well relative to everything else that's going on around it, even relative to other forms of entertainment. There's, a few reasons for that. One, it's highly interactive and it's deeply engaging and represents extraordinary value for money. Two, entertainment is kind of a fundamental human need. And even as humanity is dealt with many challenges through its course, entertainment has always risen to the top is something that has brought us together. As we think about the business now versus the last macro challenges that we may have faced, I think the good news with live services is that we have more people engaging in our games for more time and more deeply connected to each other. All of those things speak to, I think, real strength of the nature of the live service business that we operate in today. I think there is one open question if we were to have one which is in a world where you can engage deeply without spending, how we will see spending through this period, in the connects of live services. What I said in the prepared remarks is, what we're focused on is the things that we can really control, which is driving deep engagement, because what we know about engagement in our business, particularly in the context of our live services, is over the lifetime of an experience. If we can, continue to drive really strong engagement across the portfolio and across our $600 million strong community, but the lifetime that we protected overtime. Yeah. And maybe Chris could add some detail on the model. The way we think about this is really less about, which game and more about, which motivations to these games fulfill. So we know about our players is on balance, they have these call motivations, inspiration, escape, social connection, competition, self-improvement, creation, these things that bring us together as players of games. And the creation of worlds and the building of characters and the telling of stories is really important in the fulfillment of some of those motivations. So when we think about our portfolio and we think about building it out, we really think about it on two key vectors. One, how can we tell incredible stories and two, how can we build tremendous online communities and then how do we bring those two things together. So the way -- when you look at our portfolio, what you should be looking for is how are we doing that? How we build in these worlds and telling new stories, how we're developing global online communities and how we're bringing those two things together for the fulfillment of motivations. And what we see when we get that is one, we grow network until we grow the amount of time that plays in our network spend in and around our games. And as we think about single-player games, we think it's a really, really important part of the overall portfolio that we deliver in the fulfillment of those core motivations. And the way we'll plan for it over time is really just looking at our community and looking at how they're spending their time and looking at where motivations may or may not be fulfilled and we'll look to supplement that with the addition of new online games, new multi-player games and new single-player games. No. The way I would think about that, Omar, is that our guide takes into account what we view as the overall market conditions, Apex Legends had double-digit growth again in Q1. We're anticipating the full year to continue to grow on that very important franchise, and it does take into account both the things that we control from an execution standpoint as well as what we view as the market conditions, and that's all factored into the guidance that you heard. Yes. So I'll have Laura take the first part on just the performance in the quarter and then I'll talk a little bit more broadly about, how we think about the franchise going forward. And more broadly, as we said, we're going to launch the most expensive FIFA ever this year. I think it's extraordinary in demand is really strong. I was I was just in Europe, but I was bumping into young kids, and they'd find out I was doing that already preordered FIFA, which was extraordinary. I think we're seeing growth in the sport. Of course, we've got a World Cup here. And so our belief is that this is going to be a very strong year for our FIFA business. What -- the way that -- and without going broadly into the mechanics of our relationship with FIFA contracts or what have you, what you should expect is that we will launch the most expansive FIFA ever, we will then continue to sell that in the market and we have the ability to continue to do that. And then, we will begin launching the EA SPORTS FC brand more deliberately and more broadly in the market, beyond, again, what we did earlier this year, where we had nearly 200 of our 300 partners came out and promoted the EA SPORTS FC brand as a brand that we all collectively own, the 300 partners, Electronic Arts and our community of many hundreds of millions of players around the world. And so, while the name of the game will change the nature of the experience and the connection that players have to the game, to the leagues and teams they love and to the players they play with and play against in the community, that's many hundreds of men strong. None of that changes. We'll invest strongly into that and we're very excited about what that future will bring. And again, we announced our new LaLiga partnership which is going to expand on the nature of things we can do. And you remember, as we've talked about this through, we have been deeply grateful for our partnership with FIFA, which has existed for nearly 30 years, and we've built a tremendous business together. But we've been very excited in every conversation we've had about the types of things we're going to be able to do with our partners and for our community in the context of the blurring of the lines of football fandom between linear and interactive, what we do in the virtual world, and what we do in the real world, what we watch on television, what we experience in game and what we've announced with LaLiga is just the first step of that. And you should imagine that we'll continue to build and expand on this opportunity to truly bring together, what is the largest global football community around a brand that we all own together EA SPORTS FC. Yeah, great question. I'll start, and then I'll hand over to Laura, who's been working deeply with the team. The first thing, as I was saying earlier, we really see growth in our future built on two key vectors; one, the ability to create worlds and characters and tell stories and that was to build really large global online communities. When we look at Skate, I think what's happened is our ambitions have continued to grow. As you've seen what the team has been able to do around that experience, I think we continue to see opportunity. Skateboarding is kind of a cultural language for many generations. It transcends so many things, certainly geography and as we think about the ability to bring a global community of youth together through the language of skateboarding. We think this represents one of the biggest and strongest opportunities we have to build a global online community, deeply engaged in a world that involves creativity both from us and from them experiencing what starts out as skateboarding and almost certainly reaches more deeply into the cultural sensibilities of a generation. So as we thought about that, we really took a step back and evaluated how best we deliver that. And Laura has been working with the teams on how they've thought through that puzzle. First, I'm sure you don't expect me to comment on rumors and speculation from some small red media outlets, but be that as it may. I would tell you, I think we are in an incredible position. We're soon to be the largest stand-alone independent developer and publisher of interactive entertainment in the world. I think we have the most incredible teams in our industry and the plan, as Laura spoke to earlier. We're attracting more and more incredible creative talent. We have a community that's $600 million strong that is growing and certainly, we're well on our way to aspirations of being able to engage a billion people in play across the planet. I think we're growing across platforms. We're growing across business models, and we're growing across geographies. And in a world where gaming is becoming more important to the lives of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, who will be the leading generation in terms of consumption, entertainment for the future, I don't think we could be in a stronger position as a stand-alone company. Our objective always and my objective as CEO of this company is always to take care of our people, our players, and our shareholders. And should there ever be a way for us to do that differently the way we're doing it today, I, of course, have to be open to that. But I would tell you today, we feel very, very confident and excited for our future. I think the advice would be do not assume anything. We will name the titles and fill in the blanks at the appropriate time. Okay. Thanks Doug."

In FY 2024, we entertained and connected hundreds of millions of people around the world. I'm inspired by how our teams continue to create and deliver more innovative content and deeper experiences than ever. Before I dive into our results, I want to talk about the accelerating transformations across the entertainment landscape and how we have been navigating and leading through change. Firstly, consumer retention and spend are increasingly consolidated in top franchises. As live services deliver fresh content, players are going deeper and spending more time with their friends in blockbuster experiences. For example, in North America, engagement for the top 10 franchises have increased their market share since fiscal 2022. For a company that has some of the biggest IP in the world, this trend presents an incredible opportunity to evolve as an industry leader. It is against this backdrop that we have built our three strategic pillars around entertaining and engaging massive online communities, telling blockbuster stories and harnessing the power of community in and around our games. Secondly, players and fans are increasingly looking to us to deliver the entertainment they want today and tomorrow, bigger, bolder, more connected experiences where they can play, watch, create and connect like never before. As players needs and motivations expand, we continue to sharpen our focus. Across this past fiscal year, we took proactive steps to further empower our creative leaders by realigning our investments, organization and portfolio in support of our largest growth opportunities. As we have demonstrated several times in the past by building some of the world's largest franchises, when we rally behind a shared goal, EA delivers more creativity, more connection and more cutting edge experiences for players and fans. The most recent example of this is the incredible launch of our multi-platform experience, EA SPORTS FC, which was a truly profound moment for our players, our teams and our partners. This milestone as well as our execution across this fiscal year demonstrates how EA is leading the future of entertainment. I'm excited to share more details about our development pipeline, innovative experiences and new revenue streams at our Investor Day this September in New York. Our teams at EA Sports are the best in the business, delivering awesome gameplay, innovation and unmatched authenticity to fire the passion and imagination of hundreds of millions of players and fans. FY 2024 was the biggest EA SPORTS year in our history, a year in which we launched eight titles across the year, including the highly successful launch of our own brand, EA SPORTS FC. Players are connecting, competing and celebrating global football with their friends, driving strong engagement across FC's multi-platform experiences. In FY 2024, our global football franchise grew net bookings by high teens, a remarkable year considering the prior year benefited from significant tailwinds related to the World Cup. During calendar 2023, there were billions of matches played across FC experiences and the franchise's astounding success goes far beyond gameplay. Our massive global football community watch more than a billion hours of content in and around our game. Gameplay videos, pitch notes and e-sports in addition to content produced by our community. These many interactions on and off platform meaningfully increase in-game engagement, which drive stronger retention and ultimately greater levels of monetization. What we know when we look at play behavior in our games, as players spend more time with their friends, they play more, they play for longer, and this engagement leads to more in-game spend. With the successful launch of EA SPORTS FC, our focus was two-fold, delivering innovation in gameplay with HyperMotion V, new features and improvements across all modes of play for our core players, while continuing to expand the game's reach through the acquisition of new players and reengagement of lapsed players. Our go-forward strategy is anchored in building a platform that enables us to deepen our connection with players, lead the future of immersion by bringing the real world of sport and our experiences closer together and expanding the tools, modalities and partnerships to drive enhanced socialization, self-expression and creation for sports fans. We've engaged with partners like Nike, Pepsi, Uber Eats and Beats over the last year and we'll continue to do so, integrating them into matchday experiences and providing them with a platform to deeply connect with our global audience. We are also building to unlock new multifaceted sponsorship and advertising opportunities. FC is more than just a game, it's the world's leading digital football fan platform, and this is just the beginning. Year-after-year, Madden NFL unites fans and athletes through interactive experiences that fuel passion, connection and creativity. No one can match Madden's unparalleled authenticity in American football. Our talented teams pushed more innovation in the Madden NFL 24, more modalities of play and amazing content throughout the season, leading to the highest selling installment for Madden since the early 2000s and record overall net bookings. Further innovation in live service events has led to deep ongoing engagement well beyond the NFL season, especially with younger audiences as we've seen increases in weekly active users into and following the Super Bowl. Most recently, excitement has continued through the NFL draft as top picks were dropped into Ultimate Team in real time. We see this excitement leading us right into an incredible Madden NFL 25. To expand the American football experience, this summer we are launching the highly-anticipated EA SPORTS College Football 25, bringing new innovations, always on social connection and unrivaled immersion. This awesome experience will feature all 134 Football Bowl Subdivision schools, more than 11,000 college athletes, the iconic traditions and pageantry of the United States' biggest college sport and unparalleled gameplay to inspire the fandom of millions of fans. This is the next step in a multi-year plan to further evolve and grow our American football experiences into a connected ecosystem to more deeply engage and expand an already thriving community. We see incredible opportunities ahead for us across our sports business, as we continue to build ecosystems around our biggest communities, we are also prioritizing our owned IP in the rest of our broad portfolio, which are among the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Since its surprise Smash Hit release in 2019, the HD title of Apex Legends has surpassed $3.4 billion in lifetime net bookings. In FY 2024, we focused on building features and improving quality of the experience to drive long-term engagement, positioning us for future revenue growth. For example, we finished the year with significant changes to the mechanics of our popular ranked mode. We engaged with the community, increased transparency and thoughtfully addressed their feedback, and as a result, saw dramatic improvements in player sentiment across the world improving 29 points. We have also prioritized expanding Apex's appeal, making it more approachable for new and more casual players with improved onboarding and simplified modes of play like 3 Strikes and Straight Shot. Looking to the future, we will continue to invest in broadening the audience by building upon the epic characters and storytelling of this world that go beyond the current Battle Royale. The passion for Sims Community remains strong as the franchise powers towards its 25th anniversary. Since its launch in 2014, the Sims 4 has surpassed 85 million players with FY 2024 up double-digits year-over-year. The Sims Online and the Sims Mobile combined have been downloaded over 500 million times. This is already one of the largest communities in the world and we believe this hugely successful franchise has the potential to become one of the largest creator platforms in entertainment. An early proof point of the platform's evolution is the hundreds of millions of user generated content items that were shared in this fiscal year. Looking ahead, we are committed to entertaining and inspiring our loyal and engaged Sims 4 fans through over 15 content updates over the coming year, while working on multiple experiences in the Sims universe to leverage user generated content to deepen our community and expand our audience. With each immersive action-packed season of Battlefield 2042, players have made it clear that they wanted an even deeper experience. Our teams have listened to the community, have learned valuable lessons and are driving to the future. Motive, armed with cutting edge frostbite technology and compelling storytelling is joining dice, criterion and ripple effect to build a Battlefield universe across connected multiplayer and single-player experiences. This is the largest Battlefield team in franchise history. A few weeks ago, I was visiting with the teams and I couldn't be more excited about what they showed and what we were able to play. Turning to mobile, we are heads down on bringing together mobile and HD franchise leadership for EA SPORTS FC, Madden NFL and the Sims, while also continuing to make strategic investments in standalone mobile titles. Mobile is the largest platform in our industry and with our teams aligned and more empowered than ever, we see growth opportunities in this part of our business over time. I will now turn it over to Stuart for more detail on FY 2024 with additional color on the near-term industry outlook and incremental detail and metrics around our confidence in FY 2026 and FY 2027.\nStuart Canfield: Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. As Andrew spoke to earlier, we've been on a journey to transform our business to meet the needs of an evolving industry landscape, which has seen players develop new engagement behaviors and demands. To meet these changing player needs, we've been deliberate over the last fiscal year to prioritize our investments, streamline our portfolio and align our teams and organization behind our biggest strategic opportunities. Overall, these changes set us up to deliver accelerated growth from the core business, while building the foundational blocks to expand and deepen both engagement and monetization into the emerging interactive entertainment categories of create, watch and connect. Turning first of fiscal year 2024, EA delivered strong earnings growth and record cash flow in a highly competitive market. Our results were highlighted by the hugely successful rebrand for the EA SPORTS FC and growth across our largest sports franchises with both global football and Madden franchises delivering record net bookings results. For the fiscal year, we delivered total net bookings of $7.43 billion, up 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Full game net bookings of $2.01 billion, up 11% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency was driven by the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and our EA SPORTS portfolio. We launched four new non-annual sports titles in FY 2024, strengthening our EA SPORTS brand as it further expands fandom across one of the largest platforms in the world. Live services net bookings was $5.43 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the sunset of Apex Mobile, live service net bookings was about flat year-over-year. Strength in live services was driven by high teens growth year-over-year in our global football franchise, fueled by FC Ultimate Team and FC Mobile was offset by declines in Apex Legends. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $7.56 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Cost of revenue was $1.71 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by lower royalties and lower acquisition-related expenses, resulting in a gross margin of 77.4% for the year, an improvement of 150 basis points. As we continue to operate with focus and discipline, GAAP operating expenses were $4.33 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven predominantly by incremental marketing spend to support our new releases and launch of EA SPORTS FC. Our GAAP earnings per share was $4.68, which included $64 million of restructuring and related charges, significantly outpacing our original expectations, growing 63% year-over-year. Operating cash flow of $2.32 billion, a record for a fiscal year deliver considerable improvement and accelerated growth year-over-year. Capital expenditures for the year were $199 million, below our original $275 million guide as we further rationalized our real estate investment and footprint over the year. This resulted in a record year for free cash flow of $2.12 billion, up 58% year-over-year. This includes a one-time cash tax savings of approximately $150 million. Over the year, we returned $1.51 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Moving to fourth quarter results. Total net bookings for the fourth quarter was $1.67 billion, down 14% year-over-year in both actual and constant currency. Full game net bookings for the quarter was $259 million, driven by slate timing. And live services for the quarter was $1.41 billion. As a reminder, we expected Q4 net bookings to be impacted by 8 points related to slate timing. We also provided a wider guidance range to account for the dynamics of Apex Legends and EA SPORTS FC, which faced difficult comparable periods. In Apex Legends, we saw elevated engagement and monetization trends early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, monetization returned to prior norms while player sentiment and engagement remained strong. FC Mobile and Online declined year-over-year as they faced record comparables in the prior year period, fueled by World Cup tailwinds. However, FC Ultimate Team, lapping a record 20% growth in Q4 FY 2023, again, grew year-over-year, delivering low-single-digit growth. We delivered net revenue of $1.78 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Cost of revenue was $357 million, which translated to a gross margin of 79.9%, up 380 basis points year-over-year as we benefited from lower royalties and change in deferred net revenue related to product mix. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter was $1.19 billion, down 5% year-over-year from lower restructuring related charges. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.67. We delivered operating cash flow of $580 million in the quarter and free cash-flow of $529 million. Now let me turn to our outlook. In FY 2025, we expect to again drive results in a highly dynamic market, delivering fiscal year growth, strong cash flow and enhanced return on capital. We expect to do this despite a lighter slate, through new releases of iconic and fan favorite IP, continued execution and growth in our core live services and by staying focused and disciplined against our strategic growth initiatives. Our Q1 FY 2025 outlook reflects many of the trends we saw in Q4 2024 related to slate timing and atypical seasonality as we lap difficult comps year-over-year. We expect the quarter to be impacted by 15 point headwind related to release and content timing versus prior year due to three additional title launches. Live services, including EA SPORTS FC and Apex Legends will continue to face difficult comparable periods. As a reminder, Q1 FY 2024 was the largest Q1 in company history for our global football franchise. We expect net bookings for Q1 to be $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, down 27% to down 21% year-over-year. We expect net revenue of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $240 million to $250 million and operating expenses were approximately $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.90. Now moving to our outlook for FY 2025. We expect fiscal year net bookings of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, down 2% to up 4% year-over-year with mid-single-digit growth in our core live services business, partially offset by fewer title launches, lighter catalog contributions and headwinds from our mobile business related to portfolio optimization decisions taken over the last six months. Excluding our sunset titles, we expect mobile to be up low single digit. Turning to GAAP, we expect net revenue of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be $4.35 billion to $4.44 billion, flat to up 2% year-over-year as focus investment to drive growth is largely balanced by less marketing spend and acquisition related expenses. We expect GAAP operating margin to be 18% to 20.6%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 29.6% to 31.7%, the impact from change in deferred net revenue is expected to be approximately 200 to 170 basis points. We expect fiscal year GAAP EPS of $3.34 to $4. We expect our business to continue to be a strong generator of cash with operating cash flow of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion and capital expenditures of around $200 million, which would deliver a free cash flow of about $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, roughly flat year-over-year when excluding the onetime cash tax benefit noted earlier. Expanding upon the long-term financial framework we introduced last quarter, we are introducing non-GAAP operating margin guidance through FY 2027. We believe this best reflects our confidence in accelerating growth, ability to expand margins and grow cash flows. Moreover, it provides greater transparency around the impact of our strategy and future pipeline for our shareholders. By FY 2027, we expect our GAAP operating margin to expand an additional 300 to 350 basis points and we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to expand another 150 to 200 basis points. We do not expect any additional impact from change in deferred net revenue. Please refer to our slides and FAQs for further information. Our conviction in expanding margins and accelerating growth leads us to increase our stock repurchase program and extend it by an additional year. Returning capital to shareholders is an important priority for us. Our Board has authorized a stock repurchase program of $5 billion over the next three years. We expect $1.5 billion to be returned in FY 2025 with the remainder scaling with growth in our business across FY 2026 and FY 2027. In closing, as we look ahead to our September Investor Day, I'm excited to share more on our ongoing value creation framework with insights into the growth drivers across our core business and upcoming releases from our development pipeline as well as our key strategic priorities to harness the power of our community. Now, I'll hand it back over to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you, Stuart. 25 years ago, there were dozens of major independent publishers in the video game space. Today, there are only a handful, and we have an incredible competitive advantage with the excellence of our creative talent, our production strength, our broad portfolio of incredible IP, including EA SPORTS and our massive player network. With these enviable strengths, we are well positioned to grow the industry and increase our market share. As we leverage the capabilities of AI, we believe it will further supercharge these differentiators. Through decades of experience and leadership, we have led through multiple transformations in our industry. Now we have an incredible opportunity in service of our players, communities and shareholders to lead through the one taking place right now. Now Stuart and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Bhavish, we're ready for your first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Cost of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Dave on for Matt. Just a quick housekeeping question. It looks like in the new non-GAAP guidance, you're providing us a better bridge to what we're already doing in our model. So if I'm following correctly, we can now take the new non-GAAP operating margin and add or subtract for the change in deferred. And so if I'm doing the math correctly, does that bring us to an operating margin on net bookings of 31.6% to 33.4%? And then I guess, just as a quick follow up, if you could speak more to why the change in disclosure? Thanks.\nStuart Canfield: Dave, many thanks for the question. This is Stuart. Let me just quickly step back and talk about why now and why the change. We know that video game companies take different approaches with regards to capitalizing software costs. As you know, we don't capitalize software costs and we expense as we go into the P&L. Thus, we felt it was important that by bringing this measure, it helps you better understand our business as we move forward, in particular, as we think about the pipeline in 2026 and 2027 and as a way for us to clearly demonstrate the conviction in the strategy and the direction that we see the business going forward into the future. Based on your assessment and using the adjustment for the change in deferred revenue, yes, you are correct. And what I would tell you is a couple of pieces. One is that, obviously, you see expansion FY 2025, which is suddenly driven by our licensing changes. Revenue mix through the year and the ongoing focus and discipline around cost as you look at the 2025 guide and the framework of OpEx around net bookings. And then secondly, as we outlined in the prepared remarks, you'll see FY 2026 and 2027 expansion driven by the pipeline as we start to bring to market through those later years and continue to enable us to drive return in the core business and importantly, still investing in the future. I'd also add that around all of that conviction and for using that metric, that would obviously have also announced the increased stock repurchase program, which is again another really meaningful signal in conjunction with this metric of where we see the business moving in the later years.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schoell of UBS. Please go ahead.\nChris Schoell: Great. Thank you. I appreciate you've been facing very difficult comps, but can you give some color on what you're assuming for some of your larger franchises, including Apex and FC in fiscal 2025. And it appears the midpoint of the guidance is similar to your prior growth commentary, but anything you would flag that has changed relative to last earnings call in regard to your expectations for next year? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Chris. Firstly, I'll take the last question first. No material expectation shift from the framework that we outlined back in January. To your second question, broader assumption, I think it would be important to think about the phasing of how we're thinking through the year. Obviously, we put out Q1 and you'll see the challenging sort of headwinds around the title comps and slate from last year, which is really driven around we had those extra titles from before. As you think through the rest of the year and how we build out the business, obviously we look to Q2 and we see obviously the addition of college football and we expect an overall aggregated growth around our American football business. You would expect that we continue to see growth in both our core live service business and we talked to in the prepared remarks that we see that outpacing the market and sort of mid-single-digit growth. You'd expect the FC that has grown for us, and again, we grew FC again last year in 2024 expect that FC 25 being both new innovations and we continue to grow that franchise through next year. In terms of Apex, we saw great engagement and retention from players in Q4. We continue to invest behind the franchise and expect to see some advancements innovations in new seasons over the next couple of seasons in front of us that we'd start to continue to believe we drive growth back into the franchise through FY 2025. That overall brings us to a -- the profile we've put out, which is again low-single digit bookings growth for the year in a lighter release slate, but offset by growth in that core life service business.\nChris Schoell: Awesome. Thank you for that. And if I can just fit in one more quick one. Just regarding the stock repurchase program, how did you think about accelerating the buyback versus other capital allocation opportunity -- opportunities you had at your disposal?\nStuart Canfield: Yes, great question. I think the first thing I would just say is our dividend remains unchanged. The second part is you want to kind of reinforce from the stock repurchase program, sort of three validations through it. One is aligning the length of the program with the framework we're putting out in terms of the extended guidance we gave around the new disclosure metric. Secondly, I want to emphasize that the authorization obviously being bigger than our current one at $2.6 billion, rising to $5 billion. And basically something a signal we want to continue to scale that through the approach of a stock repurchase plan, which obviously gives us continued value in our mind back to shareholders and obviously flexibility as we scale through the next two or three years.\nChris Schoell: Great. Thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mr. Eric Handler of ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. You have a big live services bucket. And yes, we can decipher how much is PC and console versus mobile. But I'm wondering if you could break it up between, let's say, sports, action shoot -- action shooter and casual, how would -- like how would that break down in terms of percentages?\nStuart Canfield: Hey, Eric. This is Stuart. We're not going to break down directly the splits across the live service businesses. As a reminder, the live service category encompasses not only sort of sports, also incorporates mobile, incorporates other parts of our business, whether it's our subscription business from EA Play and other parts that comprise live services. It's a heavily aggregated category across multiple levers we have by virtue of the portfolio and the strategy we carry today. Obviously, we think that through our massive online communities, they are our largest components as we come through that live service piece. When you think about FC, Sims and Apex as comprising the biggest three of those mass online communities, we look to add obviously college football this year and obviously, Madden accompanies that inside of that envelope. We also see naturally a mobile business that wraps inside of that live service number and we've talked to that we see outside of the portfolio rationalization, we see low single digit growth in that business through next year. That kind of the big compositions that we see around that service business that makes up 73% today and ultimately gives us the flexibility and agility to be convicted in the future as we layer on both the pipeline and our strategic objectives.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I might just add, one of the great differentiators of our company is actually the breadth of our live services. So if you look at FY 2024 as we come into FY 2025, at the very center of our FY 2024 was this incredible rebranding of FC and the launching and growth of that even as we lapped a World Cup year. We had Madden, again, a live service that grew and reached record levels of revenue. We had our biggest EA SPORTS year, I would argue that EA SPORTS may be one of the greatest global multi-sport media brands in the world and certainly has greater fandom than most other brands that it competes with. We had double-digit growth in the community on the Sims, which again targets a very, very different demographic of players. And when we look at the many hundreds of millions of shared user-generated content items, you are seeing the evolution of that live service into a broader community creation platform. We continue to build resilience into Apex. And as a community sentiment of that grew 29 points over the last fiscal year. And as we're primed to continue to grow and expand that live service, we have great opportunity. And again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, I've just spent a whole bunch of time with the collective Battlefield team, playing what they're building and it is going to be another tremendous live service. And if you really use FC as the blueprint and you think about across platforms, across modalities, across business models, across geographies and also branching fan beyond the bounds of the traditional game to create truly a football fan platform that really extends the magnitude of the live service. This really is at the very center of our strategy when we talk about building content and experiences that entertain and engage massive online communities. And so, as we think about this going forward, we believe this differentiates us from the marketplace in videogames and certainly in the marketplace in entertainment and really positions us for real growth against what these emerging generations are looking for in the context of their entertainment consumption.\nEric Handler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Marok: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on Apex, if I could. Since it was a limited-time mode back in 2020, Respawn has kind of always been pretty adamant that the solo mode was never going to come back to Apex despite players clamoring for it, because it didn't mesh with their view of player behavior. So with that mode coming back in season 21 for a long-time for a limited time mode, I guess what changed? Is that part of the easier onboarding that you were referring to in the prepared remarks or something you're leaning into based on player signals?\nAndrew Wilson: Well, again, I think what the Respawn team has done and continues to do incredibly well is really work in a very transparent open way with the community. Again, this is an incredible community of hundreds of millions of players. Retention is very high. They're a very vocal community and the Respawn team may be better than many other teams in the industry works very closely with that community. And I think what we're starting to see is the evolution of both the player personality, the Apex player personality, Apex is a game and how Respawn serves that community broadly. And this will be one of those steps. But you shouldn't imagine that this is the sum total of those steps as we really think about both expansion of modalities at play for Apex when we think about deep culturalization on a geographic basis to attract new and more deeply engaged global communities. And as we think of -- as we look to what the Respawn team is doing over time, we believe that this will be a cornerstone of our live service business for many, many years to come.\nAndrew Marok: All right. Great. Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, first on the Mobile segment kind of broadly, I understand the different puts and takes on that with the pipeline. But also just trying to understand a little bit better, the underlying growth expectations for the Mobile segment of the industry, EA's market share expectations as you look out to fiscal 2026 and 2027 in that segment and what the key drivers are there? And then apologies if I missed the Stuart, but just in terms of that fiscal 2026, 2027 outlook, how should we think about the step-up between those years into 2026 and into 2027, if that contemplates any changing dynamics around the competitive landscape next year. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Great question. Let me start with kind of the mobile macro. As you've heard from us before, mobile is a very important platform to us. We've spent the last number of years really focusing our mobile business and driving meaningful profitability in that area of the business, which hasn't always been the traditional shape of the mobile business in the industry. As we look forward, our expectation is over the next 12 months or so, we probably have low-to-mid-single-digit growth in the mobile market overall. But it's still -- the mobile market remains a fairly high-risk opportunity that requires significant user acquisition cost to kind of ramp a new mobile game. And so, when we kind of couple what are increasingly longer development cycles in mobile, sometimes two to three years and we hear stories of five, six, seven years in the marketplace, meaningful user acquisition spend and long ramp times once you get to-market, mobile isn't an easy market to capitalize on. With that being said, we feel like our mobile businesses is in a very good position given its profitability. We'll be leaning into our massive online communities around FC, around Madden, around the Sims [indiscernible] will be mobile native and we'll also be looking at opportunities to invest in a very limited number of mobile native titles that we believe have breakout potential.\nStuart Canfield: Colin, with regard to your second question, we basically -- in my prepared remarks, we framed up the range of growth we expect to see through 2026 and 2027. So range through that entire period. But we referenced it through the new non-GAAP operating margin disclosure we made and we are referencing expanding 150 to 200 basis points on the 25 platform that we just put out. So intent there is to demonstrate the growth acceleration in both 2026 to 2027, as we think about growth through driven by sort of growth in a core business from team expand player acquisition, engagement retention. We know the live services to Andrew's answer on the call a second how we continue to expand both growth through the releases and our ongoing business. The new IP we've talked to in the pipeline that continues to give us lever and growth on-top in the later years. And as we see leverage from the cost structure and investment all relates down to that non-GAAP operating margin expansion through 2026 and 2027.\nColin Sebastian: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hickey: Hey, Andrew, Stuart, Andrew, Katie, thanks for taking our questions. Andrew, you had some pretty interesting comments recently at a conference talking about sort of efficiency and expansion with AI. I think you gave one example where you're talking about building out game environments like stadiums, you said that process went from six months to six weeks. So pretty incredible efficiency step-up. Just curious how you're thinking about further deploying AI on other development processes, other games, other platforms like mobile. You talked about the duration of development on mobile, maybe there's some efficiencies there. And then as a follow-up, just curious on the generative AI NPC in key franchises like sports, Battlefield, Sims, the opportunity you see there over-time? Thanks, guys.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, great question. First is, we're still very early in the AI evolution or at least the generative AI evolution. As a company, we've been deeply tied to AI since our inception. It has been the very center of all of the games that we create replicating human intelligence in the context of a gameplay experience. But certainly as we think about the wave of generative AI today and as it merges into artificial general intelligence broadly, we're still very early. But the things I talked about in the conference was really both two-fold. One, how do we get more efficient and the stat I used was we've moved from being able to create stadiums from six months-to six weeks. And my expectation is that will continue to shrink over time. Maybe even more profound than that was we went from -- when we build a game and we have animation and run cycles. So in FIFA 23, we had 36 run cycles, which gave you kind of believability of human performance inside of that game. When we launched FC 24, we had 1,200 run cycles. And so again, starting to add to the individuality and uniqueness of each player and delivering our players more immersion in the game, a more engaging experience that is more true to what they watch on television on a Sunday afternoon. And so, as we think about the first pillar of generative AI for us, we're really looking at, how can it make us more efficient, how can it give our developers more power, how can it give them back more time and allow them to get to the fund more quickly. When we think about that -- our expectation is that there is meaningful opportunity for us. We've done analysis across all of our development processes. And right now, based on our early assessment, we believe that more than 50% of our development processes will be positively impacted by the advances in generative AI. And we've got teams across the company really looking to execute against that. And the second phase for us, of course, is how do we further expand our games, how do we build bigger worlds with more characters and more interesting storylines. And if efficiency starts to really take place over the next one to three years, our expectation is that over a three to five-year time horizon, we will be able to as part of our massive online communities and blockbuster storytelling, build bigger, more immersive worlds that engage more players uniquely around the world. And we think about that on a three to five-year time horizon. And perhaps on a five-year plus time horizon, we think about how do we take all of those tools we create and offer those to the community at large so that we can actually get new and interesting and innovative and different types of game experiences. Again, not to replace what we do, but to augment, enhance, extend, expand the nature of what interactive entertainment can be and much the way YouTube did for traditional film and television. One of the great advantages, of course, that we have is we do have 40 years of data. And so as I think about efficiency over one to three years, expansion over three to five years transformation on a five year time horizon, it's actually very plausible that with 40 years of owned data that we have to feed into these models, we actually may be able to accelerate that timeframe. And I would tell you there is a real hunger amongst our developers to get to this as quickly as possible, because again, the holy grail for us is to build bigger, more innovative, more creative, more fun games more quickly so that we can entertain more people around the world on a global basis at a faster rate.\nMichael Hickey: Thank you.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Operator, we have one more question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our final question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two parter, if I can to Andrew. From a big picture standpoint, if you take a step back, I'd love to get your take on two themes we continue to hear about across the gaming landscape. One, the market opportunity for more dynamic ad insertion across more traditional AAA games across different formats and how you think that might be a revenue opportunity over the medium to long term? And the second, we've seen some fairly successful examples recently of IT adaptation out of the gaming landscape into the broader media landscape. What's your current thinking about that IT adaptation landscape going forward and what that might sit as a market opportunity for EA? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Let me start with the second part of your question, then I'll move into the first part of your question. Thinking about what you've heard from us for some time now is as we work with our global communities of players and we really listen to what they're looking for, what they hope to do is really interact and engage with their favorite IP, which as it turns out is the biggest IP in the world, many of which sit within our portfolio, they want to both play, create, watch and connect. And so our expectation on a go-forward basis is that even as we expand the definition of play and the types of things you can do in the context of these interactive worlds that as we bring in more creation opportunity in these worlds, that in and of itself will also spawn more watch. Watch traditionally, of course, is well, do we make a movie, do we make a television show and our expectation is that we will see more of that. But in addition to that, we expect that we'll see many, many billions of hours of content created by our communities, both in the context of what goes on inside the game and in the context of what goes on outside the game. And of course, the most important part of that will be out the ability for players to connect with each other in the context of play, create and watch. And so while we look at what's going in the industry right now, we see the fact that gaming IP is now manifesting inside of film and television and is topping those charts in addition to topping the interactive entertainment charts. Our expectation as we build out our portfolio is that we will get that benefit. That will be a tailwind for us. But in addition to that, we're really thinking about how we engage our players across the expansion of play, inviting them to connect and expand and extend and enhance the worlds that we create. The watch element that comes from that, we talked about billions of hours watched in FC alone, you should imagine that is also across Madden and the Sims and Battlefield and Apex, but really built on a deep sense of social connection. And that's something that a company like us has a unique ability to deliver for our players that maybe hasn't been the case with traditional entertainment companies. To answer your question on advertising broadly, again, I think it's still early on that front. And we have looked over the course of our history to be very thoughtful about advertising in the context of our play experiences. But again, as we think about the many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting and where much of that engagement happens beyond the bounds of a traditional game experience. Our expectation is that advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for us. We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that, but we have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences, but more importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Well, thank you all for being here, and thank you for the great questions. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and commitment in delivering an incredible year. To close, I'm extremely excited about what our future holds. I look forward -- and look forward to sharing more about our pipeline and longer-term strategy to drive growth at our Investor Day in New York later in the year. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stuart Canfield",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. As Andrew spoke to earlier, we've been on a journey to transform our business to meet the needs of an evolving industry landscape, which has seen players develop new engagement behaviors and demands. To meet these changing player needs, we've been deliberate over the last fiscal year to prioritize our investments, streamline our portfolio and align our teams and organization behind our biggest strategic opportunities. Overall, these changes set us up to deliver accelerated growth from the core business, while building the foundational blocks to expand and deepen both engagement and monetization into the emerging interactive entertainment categories of create, watch and connect. Turning first of fiscal year 2024, EA delivered strong earnings growth and record cash flow in a highly competitive market. Our results were highlighted by the hugely successful rebrand for the EA SPORTS FC and growth across our largest sports franchises with both global football and Madden franchises delivering record net bookings results. For the fiscal year, we delivered total net bookings of $7.43 billion, up 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Full game net bookings of $2.01 billion, up 11% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency was driven by the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and our EA SPORTS portfolio. We launched four new non-annual sports titles in FY 2024, strengthening our EA SPORTS brand as it further expands fandom across one of the largest platforms in the world. Live services net bookings was $5.43 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the sunset of Apex Mobile, live service net bookings was about flat year-over-year. Strength in live services was driven by high teens growth year-over-year in our global football franchise, fueled by FC Ultimate Team and FC Mobile was offset by declines in Apex Legends. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $7.56 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Cost of revenue was $1.71 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by lower royalties and lower acquisition-related expenses, resulting in a gross margin of 77.4% for the year, an improvement of 150 basis points. As we continue to operate with focus and discipline, GAAP operating expenses were $4.33 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven predominantly by incremental marketing spend to support our new releases and launch of EA SPORTS FC. Our GAAP earnings per share was $4.68, which included $64 million of restructuring and related charges, significantly outpacing our original expectations, growing 63% year-over-year. Operating cash flow of $2.32 billion, a record for a fiscal year deliver considerable improvement and accelerated growth year-over-year. Capital expenditures for the year were $199 million, below our original $275 million guide as we further rationalized our real estate investment and footprint over the year. This resulted in a record year for free cash flow of $2.12 billion, up 58% year-over-year. This includes a one-time cash tax savings of approximately $150 million. Over the year, we returned $1.51 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Moving to fourth quarter results. Total net bookings for the fourth quarter was $1.67 billion, down 14% year-over-year in both actual and constant currency. Full game net bookings for the quarter was $259 million, driven by slate timing. And live services for the quarter was $1.41 billion. As a reminder, we expected Q4 net bookings to be impacted by 8 points related to slate timing. We also provided a wider guidance range to account for the dynamics of Apex Legends and EA SPORTS FC, which faced difficult comparable periods. In Apex Legends, we saw elevated engagement and monetization trends early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, monetization returned to prior norms while player sentiment and engagement remained strong. FC Mobile and Online declined year-over-year as they faced record comparables in the prior year period, fueled by World Cup tailwinds. However, FC Ultimate Team, lapping a record 20% growth in Q4 FY 2023, again, grew year-over-year, delivering low-single-digit growth. We delivered net revenue of $1.78 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Cost of revenue was $357 million, which translated to a gross margin of 79.9%, up 380 basis points year-over-year as we benefited from lower royalties and change in deferred net revenue related to product mix. GAAP operating expenses for the quarter was $1.19 billion, down 5% year-over-year from lower restructuring related charges. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.67. We delivered operating cash flow of $580 million in the quarter and free cash-flow of $529 million. Now let me turn to our outlook. In FY 2025, we expect to again drive results in a highly dynamic market, delivering fiscal year growth, strong cash flow and enhanced return on capital. We expect to do this despite a lighter slate, through new releases of iconic and fan favorite IP, continued execution and growth in our core live services and by staying focused and disciplined against our strategic growth initiatives. Our Q1 FY 2025 outlook reflects many of the trends we saw in Q4 2024 related to slate timing and atypical seasonality as we lap difficult comps year-over-year. We expect the quarter to be impacted by 15 point headwind related to release and content timing versus prior year due to three additional title launches. Live services, including EA SPORTS FC and Apex Legends will continue to face difficult comparable periods. As a reminder, Q1 FY 2024 was the largest Q1 in company history for our global football franchise. We expect net bookings for Q1 to be $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, down 27% to down 21% year-over-year. We expect net revenue of $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion, cost of revenue to be $240 million to $250 million and operating expenses were approximately $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.90. Now moving to our outlook for FY 2025. We expect fiscal year net bookings of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, down 2% to up 4% year-over-year with mid-single-digit growth in our core live services business, partially offset by fewer title launches, lighter catalog contributions and headwinds from our mobile business related to portfolio optimization decisions taken over the last six months. Excluding our sunset titles, we expect mobile to be up low single digit. Turning to GAAP, we expect net revenue of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be $4.35 billion to $4.44 billion, flat to up 2% year-over-year as focus investment to drive growth is largely balanced by less marketing spend and acquisition related expenses. We expect GAAP operating margin to be 18% to 20.6%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 29.6% to 31.7%, the impact from change in deferred net revenue is expected to be approximately 200 to 170 basis points. We expect fiscal year GAAP EPS of $3.34 to $4. We expect our business to continue to be a strong generator of cash with operating cash flow of $2.05 billion to $2.25 billion and capital expenditures of around $200 million, which would deliver a free cash flow of about $1.85 billion to $2.05 billion, roughly flat year-over-year when excluding the onetime cash tax benefit noted earlier. Expanding upon the long-term financial framework we introduced last quarter, we are introducing non-GAAP operating margin guidance through FY 2027. We believe this best reflects our confidence in accelerating growth, ability to expand margins and grow cash flows. Moreover, it provides greater transparency around the impact of our strategy and future pipeline for our shareholders. By FY 2027, we expect our GAAP operating margin to expand an additional 300 to 350 basis points and we expect our non-GAAP operating margin to expand another 150 to 200 basis points. We do not expect any additional impact from change in deferred net revenue. Please refer to our slides and FAQs for further information. Our conviction in expanding margins and accelerating growth leads us to increase our stock repurchase program and extend it by an additional year. Returning capital to shareholders is an important priority for us. Our Board has authorized a stock repurchase program of $5 billion over the next three years. We expect $1.5 billion to be returned in FY 2025 with the remainder scaling with growth in our business across FY 2026 and FY 2027. In closing, as we look ahead to our September Investor Day, I'm excited to share more on our ongoing value creation framework with insights into the growth drivers across our core business and upcoming releases from our development pipeline as well as our key strategic priorities to harness the power of our community. Now, I'll hand it back over to Andrew. Dave, many thanks for the question. This is Stuart. Let me just quickly step back and talk about why now and why the change. We know that video game companies take different approaches with regards to capitalizing software costs. As you know, we don't capitalize software costs and we expense as we go into the P&L. Thus, we felt it was important that by bringing this measure, it helps you better understand our business as we move forward, in particular, as we think about the pipeline in 2026 and 2027 and as a way for us to clearly demonstrate the conviction in the strategy and the direction that we see the business going forward into the future. Based on your assessment and using the adjustment for the change in deferred revenue, yes, you are correct. And what I would tell you is a couple of pieces. One is that, obviously, you see expansion FY 2025, which is suddenly driven by our licensing changes. Revenue mix through the year and the ongoing focus and discipline around cost as you look at the 2025 guide and the framework of OpEx around net bookings. And then secondly, as we outlined in the prepared remarks, you'll see FY 2026 and 2027 expansion driven by the pipeline as we start to bring to market through those later years and continue to enable us to drive return in the core business and importantly, still investing in the future. I'd also add that around all of that conviction and for using that metric, that would obviously have also announced the increased stock repurchase program, which is again another really meaningful signal in conjunction with this metric of where we see the business moving in the later years. Yes, great question. I think the first thing I would just say is our dividend remains unchanged. The second part is you want to kind of reinforce from the stock repurchase program, sort of three validations through it. One is aligning the length of the program with the framework we're putting out in terms of the extended guidance we gave around the new disclosure metric. Secondly, I want to emphasize that the authorization obviously being bigger than our current one at $2.6 billion, rising to $5 billion. And basically something a signal we want to continue to scale that through the approach of a stock repurchase plan, which obviously gives us continued value in our mind back to shareholders and obviously flexibility as we scale through the next two or three years. Hey, Eric. This is Stuart. We're not going to break down directly the splits across the live service businesses. As a reminder, the live service category encompasses not only sort of sports, also incorporates mobile, incorporates other parts of our business, whether it's our subscription business from EA Play and other parts that comprise live services. It's a heavily aggregated category across multiple levers we have by virtue of the portfolio and the strategy we carry today. Obviously, we think that through our massive online communities, they are our largest components as we come through that live service piece. When you think about FC, Sims and Apex as comprising the biggest three of those mass online communities, we look to add obviously college football this year and obviously, Madden accompanies that inside of that envelope. We also see naturally a mobile business that wraps inside of that live service number and we've talked to that we see outside of the portfolio rationalization, we see low single digit growth in that business through next year. That kind of the big compositions that we see around that service business that makes up 73% today and ultimately gives us the flexibility and agility to be convicted in the future as we layer on both the pipeline and our strategic objectives. Colin, with regard to your second question, we basically -- in my prepared remarks, we framed up the range of growth we expect to see through 2026 and 2027. So range through that entire period. But we referenced it through the new non-GAAP operating margin disclosure we made and we are referencing expanding 150 to 200 basis points on the 25 platform that we just put out. So intent there is to demonstrate the growth acceleration in both 2026 to 2027, as we think about growth through driven by sort of growth in a core business from team expand player acquisition, engagement retention. We know the live services to Andrew's answer on the call a second how we continue to expand both growth through the releases and our ongoing business. The new IP we've talked to in the pipeline that continues to give us lever and growth on-top in the later years. And as we see leverage from the cost structure and investment all relates down to that non-GAAP operating margin expansion through 2026 and 2027."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. In FY 2024, we entertained and connected hundreds of millions of people around the world. I'm inspired by how our teams continue to create and deliver more innovative content and deeper experiences than ever. Before I dive into our results, I want to talk about the accelerating transformations across the entertainment landscape and how we have been navigating and leading through change. Firstly, consumer retention and spend are increasingly consolidated in top franchises. As live services deliver fresh content, players are going deeper and spending more time with their friends in blockbuster experiences. For example, in North America, engagement for the top 10 franchises have increased their market share since fiscal 2022. For a company that has some of the biggest IP in the world, this trend presents an incredible opportunity to evolve as an industry leader. It is against this backdrop that we have built our three strategic pillars around entertaining and engaging massive online communities, telling blockbuster stories and harnessing the power of community in and around our games. Secondly, players and fans are increasingly looking to us to deliver the entertainment they want today and tomorrow, bigger, bolder, more connected experiences where they can play, watch, create and connect like never before. As players needs and motivations expand, we continue to sharpen our focus. Across this past fiscal year, we took proactive steps to further empower our creative leaders by realigning our investments, organization and portfolio in support of our largest growth opportunities. As we have demonstrated several times in the past by building some of the world's largest franchises, when we rally behind a shared goal, EA delivers more creativity, more connection and more cutting edge experiences for players and fans. The most recent example of this is the incredible launch of our multi-platform experience, EA SPORTS FC, which was a truly profound moment for our players, our teams and our partners. This milestone as well as our execution across this fiscal year demonstrates how EA is leading the future of entertainment. I'm excited to share more details about our development pipeline, innovative experiences and new revenue streams at our Investor Day this September in New York. Our teams at EA Sports are the best in the business, delivering awesome gameplay, innovation and unmatched authenticity to fire the passion and imagination of hundreds of millions of players and fans. FY 2024 was the biggest EA SPORTS year in our history, a year in which we launched eight titles across the year, including the highly successful launch of our own brand, EA SPORTS FC. Players are connecting, competing and celebrating global football with their friends, driving strong engagement across FC's multi-platform experiences. In FY 2024, our global football franchise grew net bookings by high teens, a remarkable year considering the prior year benefited from significant tailwinds related to the World Cup. During calendar 2023, there were billions of matches played across FC experiences and the franchise's astounding success goes far beyond gameplay. Our massive global football community watch more than a billion hours of content in and around our game. Gameplay videos, pitch notes and e-sports in addition to content produced by our community. These many interactions on and off platform meaningfully increase in-game engagement, which drive stronger retention and ultimately greater levels of monetization. What we know when we look at play behavior in our games, as players spend more time with their friends, they play more, they play for longer, and this engagement leads to more in-game spend. With the successful launch of EA SPORTS FC, our focus was two-fold, delivering innovation in gameplay with HyperMotion V, new features and improvements across all modes of play for our core players, while continuing to expand the game's reach through the acquisition of new players and reengagement of lapsed players. Our go-forward strategy is anchored in building a platform that enables us to deepen our connection with players, lead the future of immersion by bringing the real world of sport and our experiences closer together and expanding the tools, modalities and partnerships to drive enhanced socialization, self-expression and creation for sports fans. We've engaged with partners like Nike, Pepsi, Uber Eats and Beats over the last year and we'll continue to do so, integrating them into matchday experiences and providing them with a platform to deeply connect with our global audience. We are also building to unlock new multifaceted sponsorship and advertising opportunities. FC is more than just a game, it's the world's leading digital football fan platform, and this is just the beginning. Year-after-year, Madden NFL unites fans and athletes through interactive experiences that fuel passion, connection and creativity. No one can match Madden's unparalleled authenticity in American football. Our talented teams pushed more innovation in the Madden NFL 24, more modalities of play and amazing content throughout the season, leading to the highest selling installment for Madden since the early 2000s and record overall net bookings. Further innovation in live service events has led to deep ongoing engagement well beyond the NFL season, especially with younger audiences as we've seen increases in weekly active users into and following the Super Bowl. Most recently, excitement has continued through the NFL draft as top picks were dropped into Ultimate Team in real time. We see this excitement leading us right into an incredible Madden NFL 25. To expand the American football experience, this summer we are launching the highly-anticipated EA SPORTS College Football 25, bringing new innovations, always on social connection and unrivaled immersion. This awesome experience will feature all 134 Football Bowl Subdivision schools, more than 11,000 college athletes, the iconic traditions and pageantry of the United States' biggest college sport and unparalleled gameplay to inspire the fandom of millions of fans. This is the next step in a multi-year plan to further evolve and grow our American football experiences into a connected ecosystem to more deeply engage and expand an already thriving community. We see incredible opportunities ahead for us across our sports business, as we continue to build ecosystems around our biggest communities, we are also prioritizing our owned IP in the rest of our broad portfolio, which are among the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world. Since its surprise Smash Hit release in 2019, the HD title of Apex Legends has surpassed $3.4 billion in lifetime net bookings. In FY 2024, we focused on building features and improving quality of the experience to drive long-term engagement, positioning us for future revenue growth. For example, we finished the year with significant changes to the mechanics of our popular ranked mode. We engaged with the community, increased transparency and thoughtfully addressed their feedback, and as a result, saw dramatic improvements in player sentiment across the world improving 29 points. We have also prioritized expanding Apex's appeal, making it more approachable for new and more casual players with improved onboarding and simplified modes of play like 3 Strikes and Straight Shot. Looking to the future, we will continue to invest in broadening the audience by building upon the epic characters and storytelling of this world that go beyond the current Battle Royale. The passion for Sims Community remains strong as the franchise powers towards its 25th anniversary. Since its launch in 2014, the Sims 4 has surpassed 85 million players with FY 2024 up double-digits year-over-year. The Sims Online and the Sims Mobile combined have been downloaded over 500 million times. This is already one of the largest communities in the world and we believe this hugely successful franchise has the potential to become one of the largest creator platforms in entertainment. An early proof point of the platform's evolution is the hundreds of millions of user generated content items that were shared in this fiscal year. Looking ahead, we are committed to entertaining and inspiring our loyal and engaged Sims 4 fans through over 15 content updates over the coming year, while working on multiple experiences in the Sims universe to leverage user generated content to deepen our community and expand our audience. With each immersive action-packed season of Battlefield 2042, players have made it clear that they wanted an even deeper experience. Our teams have listened to the community, have learned valuable lessons and are driving to the future. Motive, armed with cutting edge frostbite technology and compelling storytelling is joining dice, criterion and ripple effect to build a Battlefield universe across connected multiplayer and single-player experiences. This is the largest Battlefield team in franchise history. A few weeks ago, I was visiting with the teams and I couldn't be more excited about what they showed and what we were able to play. Turning to mobile, we are heads down on bringing together mobile and HD franchise leadership for EA SPORTS FC, Madden NFL and the Sims, while also continuing to make strategic investments in standalone mobile titles. Mobile is the largest platform in our industry and with our teams aligned and more empowered than ever, we see growth opportunities in this part of our business over time. I will now turn it over to Stuart for more detail on FY 2024 with additional color on the near-term industry outlook and incremental detail and metrics around our confidence in FY 2026 and FY 2027. Thank you, Stuart. 25 years ago, there were dozens of major independent publishers in the video game space. Today, there are only a handful, and we have an incredible competitive advantage with the excellence of our creative talent, our production strength, our broad portfolio of incredible IP, including EA SPORTS and our massive player network. With these enviable strengths, we are well positioned to grow the industry and increase our market share. As we leverage the capabilities of AI, we believe it will further supercharge these differentiators. Through decades of experience and leadership, we have led through multiple transformations in our industry. Now we have an incredible opportunity in service of our players, communities and shareholders to lead through the one taking place right now. Now Stuart and I are here for your questions. Thanks, Chris. Firstly, I'll take the last question first. No material expectation shift from the framework that we outlined back in January. To your second question, broader assumption, I think it would be important to think about the phasing of how we're thinking through the year. Obviously, we put out Q1 and you'll see the challenging sort of headwinds around the title comps and slate from last year, which is really driven around we had those extra titles from before. As you think through the rest of the year and how we build out the business, obviously we look to Q2 and we see obviously the addition of college football and we expect an overall aggregated growth around our American football business. You would expect that we continue to see growth in both our core live service business and we talked to in the prepared remarks that we see that outpacing the market and sort of mid-single-digit growth. You'd expect the FC that has grown for us, and again, we grew FC again last year in 2024 expect that FC 25 being both new innovations and we continue to grow that franchise through next year. In terms of Apex, we saw great engagement and retention from players in Q4. We continue to invest behind the franchise and expect to see some advancements innovations in new seasons over the next couple of seasons in front of us that we'd start to continue to believe we drive growth back into the franchise through FY 2025. That overall brings us to a -- the profile we've put out, which is again low-single digit bookings growth for the year in a lighter release slate, but offset by growth in that core life service business. Yes. I might just add, one of the great differentiators of our company is actually the breadth of our live services. So if you look at FY 2024 as we come into FY 2025, at the very center of our FY 2024 was this incredible rebranding of FC and the launching and growth of that even as we lapped a World Cup year. We had Madden, again, a live service that grew and reached record levels of revenue. We had our biggest EA SPORTS year, I would argue that EA SPORTS may be one of the greatest global multi-sport media brands in the world and certainly has greater fandom than most other brands that it competes with. We had double-digit growth in the community on the Sims, which again targets a very, very different demographic of players. And when we look at the many hundreds of millions of shared user-generated content items, you are seeing the evolution of that live service into a broader community creation platform. We continue to build resilience into Apex. And as a community sentiment of that grew 29 points over the last fiscal year. And as we're primed to continue to grow and expand that live service, we have great opportunity. And again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, I've just spent a whole bunch of time with the collective Battlefield team, playing what they're building and it is going to be another tremendous live service. And if you really use FC as the blueprint and you think about across platforms, across modalities, across business models, across geographies and also branching fan beyond the bounds of the traditional game to create truly a football fan platform that really extends the magnitude of the live service. This really is at the very center of our strategy when we talk about building content and experiences that entertain and engage massive online communities. And so, as we think about this going forward, we believe this differentiates us from the marketplace in videogames and certainly in the marketplace in entertainment and really positions us for real growth against what these emerging generations are looking for in the context of their entertainment consumption. Well, again, I think what the Respawn team has done and continues to do incredibly well is really work in a very transparent open way with the community. Again, this is an incredible community of hundreds of millions of players. Retention is very high. They're a very vocal community and the Respawn team may be better than many other teams in the industry works very closely with that community. And I think what we're starting to see is the evolution of both the player personality, the Apex player personality, Apex is a game and how Respawn serves that community broadly. And this will be one of those steps. But you shouldn't imagine that this is the sum total of those steps as we really think about both expansion of modalities at play for Apex when we think about deep culturalization on a geographic basis to attract new and more deeply engaged global communities. And as we think of -- as we look to what the Respawn team is doing over time, we believe that this will be a cornerstone of our live service business for many, many years to come. Yes. Great question. Let me start with kind of the mobile macro. As you've heard from us before, mobile is a very important platform to us. We've spent the last number of years really focusing our mobile business and driving meaningful profitability in that area of the business, which hasn't always been the traditional shape of the mobile business in the industry. As we look forward, our expectation is over the next 12 months or so, we probably have low-to-mid-single-digit growth in the mobile market overall. But it's still -- the mobile market remains a fairly high-risk opportunity that requires significant user acquisition cost to kind of ramp a new mobile game. And so, when we kind of couple what are increasingly longer development cycles in mobile, sometimes two to three years and we hear stories of five, six, seven years in the marketplace, meaningful user acquisition spend and long ramp times once you get to-market, mobile isn't an easy market to capitalize on. With that being said, we feel like our mobile businesses is in a very good position given its profitability. We'll be leaning into our massive online communities around FC, around Madden, around the Sims [indiscernible] will be mobile native and we'll also be looking at opportunities to invest in a very limited number of mobile native titles that we believe have breakout potential. Yes, great question. First is, we're still very early in the AI evolution or at least the generative AI evolution. As a company, we've been deeply tied to AI since our inception. It has been the very center of all of the games that we create replicating human intelligence in the context of a gameplay experience. But certainly as we think about the wave of generative AI today and as it merges into artificial general intelligence broadly, we're still very early. But the things I talked about in the conference was really both two-fold. One, how do we get more efficient and the stat I used was we've moved from being able to create stadiums from six months-to six weeks. And my expectation is that will continue to shrink over time. Maybe even more profound than that was we went from -- when we build a game and we have animation and run cycles. So in FIFA 23, we had 36 run cycles, which gave you kind of believability of human performance inside of that game. When we launched FC 24, we had 1,200 run cycles. And so again, starting to add to the individuality and uniqueness of each player and delivering our players more immersion in the game, a more engaging experience that is more true to what they watch on television on a Sunday afternoon. And so, as we think about the first pillar of generative AI for us, we're really looking at, how can it make us more efficient, how can it give our developers more power, how can it give them back more time and allow them to get to the fund more quickly. When we think about that -- our expectation is that there is meaningful opportunity for us. We've done analysis across all of our development processes. And right now, based on our early assessment, we believe that more than 50% of our development processes will be positively impacted by the advances in generative AI. And we've got teams across the company really looking to execute against that. And the second phase for us, of course, is how do we further expand our games, how do we build bigger worlds with more characters and more interesting storylines. And if efficiency starts to really take place over the next one to three years, our expectation is that over a three to five-year time horizon, we will be able to as part of our massive online communities and blockbuster storytelling, build bigger, more immersive worlds that engage more players uniquely around the world. And we think about that on a three to five-year time horizon. And perhaps on a five-year plus time horizon, we think about how do we take all of those tools we create and offer those to the community at large so that we can actually get new and interesting and innovative and different types of game experiences. Again, not to replace what we do, but to augment, enhance, extend, expand the nature of what interactive entertainment can be and much the way YouTube did for traditional film and television. One of the great advantages, of course, that we have is we do have 40 years of data. And so as I think about efficiency over one to three years, expansion over three to five years transformation on a five year time horizon, it's actually very plausible that with 40 years of owned data that we have to feed into these models, we actually may be able to accelerate that timeframe. And I would tell you there is a real hunger amongst our developers to get to this as quickly as possible, because again, the holy grail for us is to build bigger, more innovative, more creative, more fun games more quickly so that we can entertain more people around the world on a global basis at a faster rate. Let me start with the second part of your question, then I'll move into the first part of your question. Thinking about what you've heard from us for some time now is as we work with our global communities of players and we really listen to what they're looking for, what they hope to do is really interact and engage with their favorite IP, which as it turns out is the biggest IP in the world, many of which sit within our portfolio, they want to both play, create, watch and connect. And so our expectation on a go-forward basis is that even as we expand the definition of play and the types of things you can do in the context of these interactive worlds that as we bring in more creation opportunity in these worlds, that in and of itself will also spawn more watch. Watch traditionally, of course, is well, do we make a movie, do we make a television show and our expectation is that we will see more of that. But in addition to that, we expect that we'll see many, many billions of hours of content created by our communities, both in the context of what goes on inside the game and in the context of what goes on outside the game. And of course, the most important part of that will be out the ability for players to connect with each other in the context of play, create and watch. And so while we look at what's going in the industry right now, we see the fact that gaming IP is now manifesting inside of film and television and is topping those charts in addition to topping the interactive entertainment charts. Our expectation as we build out our portfolio is that we will get that benefit. That will be a tailwind for us. But in addition to that, we're really thinking about how we engage our players across the expansion of play, inviting them to connect and expand and extend and enhance the worlds that we create. The watch element that comes from that, we talked about billions of hours watched in FC alone, you should imagine that is also across Madden and the Sims and Battlefield and Apex, but really built on a deep sense of social connection. And that's something that a company like us has a unique ability to deliver for our players that maybe hasn't been the case with traditional entertainment companies. To answer your question on advertising broadly, again, I think it's still early on that front. And we have looked over the course of our history to be very thoughtful about advertising in the context of our play experiences. But again, as we think about the many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting and where much of that engagement happens beyond the bounds of a traditional game experience. Our expectation is that advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for us. We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that, but we have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences, but more importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences. Okay. Well, thank you all for being here, and thank you for the great questions. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and commitment in delivering an incredible year. To close, I'm extremely excited about what our future holds. I look forward -- and look forward to sharing more about our pipeline and longer-term strategy to drive growth at our Investor Day in New York later in the year. Thank you so much."

It was a strong Q3, as we continue to entertain hundreds of millions of players and fans around the world. Our exceptional teams created high-quality games and experiences across our broad portfolio that, drove deep engagement and record live services. This quarter, two of the world's most celebrated interactive entertainment experiences EA SPORTS FC and EA SPORTS Madden NFL delivered phenomenal strength, as sizable drivers of long-term growth. We are launching amazing games and experiences that entertain massive online communities, create blockbuster interactive storytelling, and harness the power of community in and around our games. EA's Q3 results are a great example of our execution across our strategy. The FC platform is thriving at the center of the action, fandom, and culture of the world's game. The launch of EA SPORTS FC 24 has been a great success and has, once again, outperformed our expectations. Players are connecting, competing, and celebrating global football with their friends, driving strong engagement across FC's multi-experience ecosystem. In Q3, players dove into Ultimate Team, driving double-digit net bookings growth and delivering the franchise's biggest net bookings week ever. FC Mobile also generated deep engagement with daily active users up by 29% year-over-year, while FC Online grew new players by 20% year-over-year. In calendar 2023, Madden NFL was the best-selling sports game in North America and continues to grow. Madden NFL 24, is engaging more players year-over-year through new, innovative gameplay features and compelling live services. In Q3, net bookings grew and engagement with Ultimate Team increased 19%. Madden Mobile also saw an increase in players during the quarter, generating double-digit growth across the community. Our business is gaining momentum as our communities continue to grow and the definition of play rapidly expands, to include watching gameplay, creating user generated content, and connecting with friends and families in and around beloved IP. There are billions of players around the world and this number, is expected to increase as younger generations choose gaming as their number one form of entertainment, generating incredible opportunities, for us to engage and deliver new experiences. The evolving worlds, unfolding stories, and rich characters of our live services are deepening players' relationship with our IP and broadening the global appeal of our portfolio. To further entertain our communities, we are building more ways for them to play, watch, create, and connect to generate growth and longevity in our biggest franchises. The Sims franchise, is the definitive life for simulation experience, offering its multi-generational community incredible ways to connect, create, and express their individuality. During calendar 2023, players have spent an astounding 1.8 billion hours in the Sims 4, a nearly 30% increase from the prior year. We remain committed to the global growth and innovation of this franchise. We're focused on delivering what the community wants most, from ongoing, new content and game modes for the Sims 4, to the social innovation, expansion, and connection in our future Sims release. Millions of passionate fans continue to come together through the nonstop action of Battlefield. The Battlefield 2042 community continues to grow, with total players up 17% year-over-year, and Season 6 live services driving strong engagement with weekly average users up 37% year-over-year. Our team is working hard to deliver for the community with increasingly engaging live services, like the recent announcement of Season 7 with new maps, weekly missions, and much more. In addition, we are making investments in the future of the franchise. Our exceptional teams from multiple world class studios, working with cutting-edge Frostbite technology, are building an expansive, community-focused Battlefield universe for fans all over the world. As a category leader with millions of loyal fans, we are looking forward to celebrating the fifth anniversary of Apex Legends. Over the past few months, we have listened closely to our community, and have deployed new features, new styles of play, and new content. We have also implemented tools, to better understand day-to-day game performance. In Q3, our new modes drove improved engagement, and the early impact of our new content in the current quarter is promising. To generate future growth, we are focused on entertaining core players and engaging new players, by investing in geographic expansion, innovating in the game economy, and making it easier than ever, for players to jump into our gameplay. Turning to FY '25, we will deliver even more excitement and entertainment through an expanded portfolio of connected ecosystems. Industry-leader EA SPORTS will launch a strong core slate of titles and always-on live services, to grow our sports business as a global community and drive value, year-after-year. Our journey building FC, the world's largest interactive platform for global football fans will continue with accelerated gameplay innovation, more social connection, and new brand collaborations to deliver even more value for players. Our teams, working with an incredible roster of partners, are just getting started with FC. We are well positioned to grow this platform as a cultural phenomenon. The momentum in Madden NFL will continue with events and experiences, tied to the biggest moments in the sport, alongside deeper investments in this ecosystem, including leaps in gameplay and deeper fan immersion. In addition to the meaningful advancements in Madden, we are bringing back fan favorite EA SPORTS College Football for the first time in over a decade. Looking further ahead, as more people spend more time playing and connecting in and around our titles, we see incredible potential for growth. Within our online communities, we are expanding blockbuster storytelling through deep, rich characters and new story modes to deliver bigger, broader games and live services. Connected experiences offer new, cutting-edge ways to engage and inspire players, and can unlock future innovative growth opportunities. Over the coming years, we expect accelerated growth in our business. Our long-term outlook coupled with secular tailwinds, drives further conviction in our strategy. By aligning our priorities and investments with our greatest opportunities, we can make the biggest impact and drive long-term value in service of our people, our players, and our shareholders. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business.\nStuart Canfield: Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter, we delivered net bookings of $2.37 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or 2% in constant currency, and in line with our expectations. Strength in our live services business, particularly EA SPORTS FC Ultimate Team, was partially offset by some softness in the full game. Live services net bookings grew to a record $1.71 billion in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, or up 5% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations, as we continue to drive healthy engagement and bring new players to our franchises. Full game net bookings of $654 million was down 5% year-over-year, or down 4% in constant currency, versus a high prior year comparable that included the World Cup event. On a trailing 12-month basis, total net bookings was up 8% year-over-year, with live services contributing $5.6 billion, or 73% demonstrating the resilience of this evergreen business model. Building on the strong momentum from our launch at the end of Q2, EA SPORTS FC again exceeded expectations, as EA SPORTS FC Ultimate Team and FC Mobile delivered exceptional double-digit net bookings growth, against a World Cup comparable in the prior year. Our global football business net bookings grew 7% year-over-year, as our teams continue to drive strong retention of our core player base, through the FC brand transition. EA SPORTS Madden NFL, also saw another strong quarter, with net bookings up 5% year-over-year, highlighted by strong engagement trends across full game, Ultimate Team, and mobile. Additional highlights from the third quarter included new releases of EA SPORTS UFC, NHL, and World Rally Championship, which contributed to further expanding the aggregate fandom and strength of our EA SPORTS community, creating additional value-added services in one of the largest sports brands and platforms in the world. In a highly competitive quarter, Apex Legends did not meet our expectations, as our teams continue to learn and iterate with each new season and event. In the past few weeks, our recent cross-over promotion showed early promising signals, delivering two of our highest net bookings days over the fiscal year. With Season 20 launching in February, our teams will deliver more innovation as we continue to build for the long-term. We remain committed to Apex Legends, a proven franchise with loyal fans, and we will continue to invest in opportunities to drive new growth points as we build and expand the franchise over time through engaging a broader base of players. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $1.95 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As we continue to operate with focus and discipline, operating expenses were favorable to our expectations, also benefiting from some phasing of spend to Q4. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were up 3%, driven primarily by incremental marketing spend as we invested to support our titles and the EA SPORTS FC transition through the critical holiday season. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, up 47% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 13% year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was a record $2.16 billion. And we returned $376 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. We are entering the final quarter of FY '24 well positioned to deliver on our commitments for the fiscal year. With our strong business performance year-to-date, our unrivaled portfolio of IP, and our consistent execution in our core live services business. Even in an incredibly competitive market, we are poised to deliver growth in net bookings consistent with what we outlined at the beginning of the year. At the same time, we are tracking to deliver higher levels of underlying profitability and record free cash flow. We remain deliberate and focused around the prioritization and allocation of resources across our teams and portfolio as we make progress against our long-term strategy to drive durable growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder returns. Turning to our Q4 outlook, I\u2019d like to start by sharing a few key considerations. First, as a reminder, our Q4 net bookings, is impacted by timing, including releases of our full game and content offerings in the prior year. Second, we expect moderated growth in our EA SPORTS FC franchise as we lap record prior year performance. For the full year, we now expect EA SPORTS FC net bookings, to grow mid-to-high single digits, excluding FX. Third, we continue to take a measured approach to Apex Legends in its largest quarter of the year, as we introduce new modes of play and content offerings. And finally, we expect impact from FX to be minimal, as the benefit from more favorable currency exchange rates, is offset by hedging gains from the prior year. As a result, we expect net bookings of $1.625 billion to $1.925 billion, down 16% to down 1% year-over-year, including approximately eight points of impact from the timing noted earlier. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.925 billion and cost of revenue of $360 million to $410 million. We expect operating expenses of $1.125 billion to $1.205 billion, including a $70 million impairment charge of certain acquisition-related intangible assets. This results in GAAP earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.68 for the fourth quarter. Before handing back to Andrew, I'd like to take a moment to share some early perspective on our multiyear growth objectives. EA is in an advantaged position to lead the future of interactive entertainment, with ongoing secular tailwinds and structural shifts within the industry, further amplifying our strategy. Our long-term financial framework is founded upon creating value for our shareholders by accelerating growth, delivering forward operating leverage, and increasing cash flow. In executing on our strategy, we expect to scale operating leverage through the following growth levers: 1) expanded player acquisition, engagement, and retention 2) highly accretive digital and live services 3) blockbuster new releases from our development pipeline, alongside compounding growth across our core franchises, and 4) discipline and focus on aligning our cost structure to invest in support of our strategic growth opportunities. As we look ahead to FY '25, and more specific guidance in our upcoming Q4 earnings call, I wanted to share some initial considerations. Assuming minimal impact to our results from FX, we expect low-single-digit net bookings growth, reflecting continued execution in our core businesses in a lighter release slate year. And excluding any impact from future share repurchases, we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in underlying profitability. Looking beyond FY '25, over the next couple of years, we expect our net bookings growth to accelerate, bolstered by our portfolio of industry-leading IP. Compounding growth within our core Sports franchises, new content and engaging experiences across our massive online communities, and iconic new releases like Battlefield, Sims, and other in-development titles, provide the inflection point that fuels net bookings growth and increases underlying profitability. And we expect to continue to deliver meaningful operating leverage and drive increased cash flow conversion, even as we continue to invest, to support our strategic objectives. In summary, with our incredible talent, industry-leading IP and technology, global and growing communities of fans, and our focus and discipline around our strategic objectives, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth commitments and drive value for our players and for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more over the coming quarters. Now, I'll hand it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Stuart. I am inspired by the opportunities ahead, as we continue to execute our long-term strategy. Our mission to inspire the world to play is evolving and expanding beyond the traditional bounds of play. Technological advancements are powering creativity and innovation, transforming what we can deliver. We are positioned to bring bigger, broader games and experiences to an even larger global audience in the coming years. Our awesome teams, industry leading technology, world-class IP, and global network of players position EA as a leader of the future of entertainment. Now, Stuart and I are here for your questions.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Brianna, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Thanks for taking my questions. One tactical, one long-term. On the tactical one, it looks like the fourth quarter and full year guidance ranges, are pretty wide relative, to what you normally do. Just curious, one, if that's correct, and two, why is that when it seems like a lot of live services is outperforming?\nStuart Canfield: Andrew, this is Stuart. I'll take that. Yes, first of all, the range, as we look forward, we'll continue to be broader, in this case, in the quarter, in part for two reasons. One, it's a more dynamic quarter for us, as you referenced, on our core live services. And the range is that, it reflects the both strength and opportunity we see. So, we're slapping a record World Cup comp for FC, and also is a fiscal high quarter for Apex. The second part, I'd also flag is that, as a reminder on the prepared remarks, is that we have eight points of headwind as well from timing of content released in the prior year. So, hence, the spread between the top and the bottom, is based around the biggest dynamic services we have in the quarter, particularly FC and Apex.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. That's helpful. And then, I appreciate you giving the color on the forward years. On the operating leverage, could you just maybe, walk us through a little bit, or give us additional color on the primary drivers there? Is that more live services from games, like Sims or Escape eventually? Or is that just naturally operating leverage from the fact you guys don't capitalize costs? Just kind of help us out, understand that dynamic a little bit better. I appreciate it? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, let me start with this. Let's take a look at sort of the business over the longer term. We're laying out that overarching framework. It's kind of grounded in three pieces, accelerating growth on the top line, expanding leverage on the bottom and increasing cash flow. We're looking at that through a couple of different lenses. So one is, we do expect to continue to drive compounding growth across our core franchises. Plus, we expect to release from our pipeline that's been in development. And both of those will be bolstered, by expanded player acquisition, engagement and retention. As you know, our live services make up almost three quarters of our business, which highlights the evergreen nature of that business model and thus the ability to drive compounded growth, on those franchises through the future. New releases are the second part and they're an important lever for us, on that multi-year growth journey. And we're really flagging, through the long-term journey. They'll create some non-linearity in that growth, in terms of how we accelerate through the later years, depending on timing around that pipeline. Additional context would be that as we continue to drive through live service, and we see greater digital, we get far more accretion through that mix. We're also continuing to be really focused around getting leverage and scale out of OpEx in terms of our cost structure to drive growth. So, we think about those four pieces, core compounding growth across our current core business and live services, a more digital nature around that drives accretion and scale. Add to that the new releases that come through the pipeline, and ongoing management of costs, to ensure that we're investing for the future will ultimately provide leverage over the long-term for us.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nKatie Burke: Brianna, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. One would just be on some recent changes we've seen on app store fees in Europe, for Apple specifically. I guess, any early learnings there, any reflection on the possibility that you could see outside to gross margins for your mobile game business, at least in Europe? Is that an option that you would be interested in? Since I know it's an opt-in thing for game publishers. That's point one, question one. Question two, just beyond college football, as we get a little bit closer to release, can you do anything to help scale the opportunity for everyone and sort of think through what is incremental versus, what might come from the existing Madden customer base? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Hi, Matt. So, I'll quickly touch on the Apple one first. Yes, we're also aware of the intentions to update the European app store tied to their fees. We're still actively reviewing all of those updates and sort of working to understand potential implications to our business and any changes that may flow through from a gross margin perspective. As we gain more insight, understanding, we'll be able to provide a more update sort of next quarter in terms of how that might map through for us and impact gross margin, but no updates, or reflection of that at this point.\nStuart Canfield: And on college football, our expectation is it will be additive. As we think about Madden, Madden is performing incredibly well this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, the biggest game, the biggest sports game in calendar year 2023, we're seeing increased engagement in the game and increased monetization in Ultimate Team as part of that. The team is continuing to invest meaningfully into the modes of Madden and the expansion of Madden as a product and certainly as we look at the NFL broadly and the fan base continue to grow and the incredible season we're having this year, our expectation is that we will invest behind Madden and grow Madden, and that what college football represents as a game that's been 10 years in the waiting for our fans. Is that there's incredible amount of pent up demand and we expect that to be additive to the ecosystem. And over the broad course of time, the way our team thinks about this, is how do we really expand the football community in this country and internationally through a combination of both Madden and college that, we think will be both complementary in gameplay, but overall additive to the ecosystem.\nMatthew Cost: Great, thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Chris Schull] with UBS.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned in the press release that you're prioritizing investment in the largest opportunities for multi-year growth. I appreciate you're looking to drive growth across the portfolio, but which franchises in particular - do you see the most incremental opportunity, as you look out into fiscal '25 and beyond? And then we've also seen some new developments and announcements from your peers around subscription gaming. Can you just remind us how you're thinking, about the role of subscription gaming, to your business and what traction you're seeing with EA Play and how do you balance making content available on your platform versus third-parties? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, great question. Thank you. First and foremost, I would go back to as a core entertainment company, it is always important that, we are developing and investing in new IP, to grow the future pipeline opportunity, that optionality that Stuart referred to earlier. And we have the strongest pipeline, I think we've had in many, many years as we go into those out years in terms of both our core IP and new IP. If we look at the trailing 12-months, both in terms of engagement and monetization, what we do see however, is that the biggest games are these games that really entertain and engage massive online communities. And these are existing franchises that either evolve on a month-by-month cadence, or evolve with annual releases plus live services. And so, as we think about the foundation of growth for our business, we think about FC. Again, this was the first year of FC branding. What we've spoken about in the past few quarters, is having that FC branding and partnering more closely with the core leagues in territory gives us more growth opportunities, than we believe we ever had before. It is building around Madden NFL and expanding the broader college football base, but it's also investing in the Sims and in Apex and in Battlefield. And ultimately some of those as we go down through the next coming years. And so, while we will continue to invest meaningfully behind new IP, and we will be thoughtful and focused on those investments, we see significant opportunity based on how communities are coming together in games, around our biggest franchises, FC, Madden, Sims, Battlefield, Apex. And we will work meaningfully, to expand those over the coming years.\nStuart Canfield: And then on subscription, remember we have been early in subscription as a company. We have EA Play as a subscription that exists across platforms. It is part of the Game Pass Ultimate service on Xbox Live as well. I think that we believe, as we look forward that subscription will be a meaningful part of our industry, over the course of time. It hasn't really translated in the same way that a linear television or movie subscription has or a music subscription, just because of the nature of engagement in our content relative to those other mediums. However, as we think about the future, we do believe there is an opportunity to fundamentally disrupt how households consume content broadly. As we look at leaders in a space like Netflix and them leaning into games, as we listen to the performance of Warner Brothers' games division and their conversation around how that might feed into their broader subscription over time. We think we are in an incredibly strong position to continue to lead on subscription, at least as it relates with interactive, because of both the depth and the breadth of our portfolio, which as we look at our portfolio, we believe it is unrivaled in the industry, and spans across many genres, including sport, which of course is a meaningful driver of entertainment value in the coming years.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you, Chris. Briana, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Andrew, I wonder, if you have you ever thought about taking all of your essentially siloed sport communities and thinking about a way to bring them all together so that hockey fans, can talk to soccer fans, or football fans talk to UFC fans. And that way, you can build a huge community around that, where you could then layer in various highlight clips of real-world games and e-commerce, just sort of create, for lack of a better word, a metaverse, given how massive your community is?\nAndrew Wilson: Incredible question, and also very insightful. And certainly, as you think about our network, which is well over 700 million right now, about half of that interact with our sports games. And so, as we think about our sports community, it is almost certainly one of the largest collective sports communities on the planet. As we think about EA SPORTS as a brand, we know from brand research around the world. It's also one of the most recognizable and recognized sports brands. And as we think about emerging consumer generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for many of them, their first relationship with sports comes through their relationship with the leagues and teams and sports they love, as a result of their interaction with their EA SPORTS products. And so, what we know to be true is right now, as we think about our players. They spend on average about 90 minutes a session inside of one of our games. They then leave that game experience, where they've been deeply connected with their core friend unit, and they go and they talk about that experience on another platform. And then they go and create content about, that experience on yet another platform, and then finally, they go and watch that content on another platform. We do believe, we have a meaningful opportunity over the coming years to actually harness the power of that community, both inside and outside of our games, which is really the third pillar of our core strategy, and will be led by our EA SPORTS brand. So again, a super insightful question, nothing to announce today, but you should imagine that we see the very same thing. We see an incredible opportunity by virtue of the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio, the breadth and depth of our sports relationships around the world, which I think are unmatched on a global basis, and certainly the size and magnitude of our sports gaming community, and the relationship they have with their favorite sports through us, but more importantly, the connections that they're making with their friends, as a result of the time they spend with us. We think there's a meaningful opportunity for us to expand on that, both inside the game, and we're seeing that already, in our core products like FC and Madden, but also outside the game. And some of the starting points of that, are some of the deals that we've done with our licensed partners that do allow us to bring highlights, and other non-gaming content into the ecosystem broadly. So, best I can say is watch this space.\nEric Handler: Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, I wonder if you could just give a little bit of an update about sort of the state of the mobile industry, sort of what you're seeing. Did mobile bookings were up modestly in the quarter. Do you think you've reached stabilization and you can expand from here? What are you seeing in the market?\nStuart Canfield: All right. I'll - give a quick position on the financial framing that you just talked to. So yes, sort of in Q3, we actually tracked up 5% at constant currency when you exclude lapping of Apex from the prior year. We did see improvement sequentially. We saw double-digit improvement between Q2 and Q3. Our overall mobile portfolio, as you talked to, you saw the strength that we called out in particular around FC within that mix. We saw double-digit growth year-on-year, as we even entered a World Cup comp. In terms of how we think about mobile, as we move forward. I think we've been very clear on the strategy that, we're focused on, which continues to lean into the success we've seen around FC and our broader ecosystems as both an entry point, and expansion for us in terms of players. We'll continue to lean and focus on those across our biggest opportunities through whether it's FC, Madden, Sims, Battlefield and beyond. Second part is we continue to look for the biggest hits in IP and opportunities that can stand alone on mobile itself. Wrapped inside of an incredibly disciplined approach as we've focused on driving profitability across this platform to some of our more historic levels versus the past. So, those are three kind of profiles we expect. So yes, quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement, strength overall year-on-year with plus 5% and a diligent strategy and approach from us around our biggest opportunities on ecosystems, IP within the platform with mobile itself, and obviously disciplined P&L performance around the business.\nEric Handler: Thank you very much.\nKatie Burke: Thank you, Eric. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with BMO Capital Market.\nBrian Pitz: Thanks for the question. Andrew, we've seen reports that sports leagues like the NFL and NBA considering ownership stakes in the likes of ESPN. Obviously, EA has one of the most valuable audiences in sports. Just curious, are there opportunities for EA to partner more closely with these leagues? And also from another dimension, I guess, how do you think about this opportunity as the NFL and other leagues embrace sports betting? Is there a real money gaming opportunity? I know the industry has looked at it in the past, but I think we're in a new place now going forward? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, again, great questions. I think the relationship between the NFL and the NBA and the likes of ESPN, is super interesting to us. I would think about this on two vectors. One, we have incredible relationships with our sports leagues. Many of them we've had for over 30 years and they have evolved with us, and we have evolved with them. A big part of what we have done through the rebrand of FC, is actually gotten significantly closer to our European Football League partners. And much of what we've done as we have renewed and bolstered those relationships for the next decade, and beyond is really think about, how we can come together in service of fans more broadly, not just fans in the context of interactive gameplay. And part of what you're seeing here as we start to bring highlights into our games and really think about FC as a platform, is kind of testament to that evolution of the nature of our relationship. I do believe that we have the opportunity to do the same, with the NFL and the NBA and you should imagine that we're working very closely with all of our league partners, NHL, UFC, F1, and we see a tremendous opportunity to really think about, EA SPORTS as a platform for engagement, and how we might grow in service of our fans, with our league partners. I would also highlight we've had a relationship with ESPN for the best part of 30 years and have worked very closely with them and continue to work very closely with ESPN and the Walt Disney Company as we think about the future of entertainment broadly. And so, we feel very good about our position in this future. We feel very good about the connection we have with the fans. We feel very good about our opportunity to grow our business as a result of this evolved service opportunity we have with them.\nBrian Pitz: Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James.\nAndrew Marok: Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig into a couple of things on the recent Apex event this last month with FINAL FANTASY. So commentary sounded really good in the prepared remarks, but with the dynamic that versus prior collection events, it was maybe less expensive for the first few items, but more expensive to complete. How did that affect payer dynamics and what are some of the key learnings coming out of that event for you guys?\nAndrew Wilson: I guess - at a macro level we're really, really happy with that event. It was very well received by the community and it actually performed incredibly well. And certainly as we were in what was a very, very competitive quarter, there were a couple of competitive titles that, actually did some really unique and interesting things in the quarter. And so, the performance of Apex with that collection event in the context of some of these other unique things happening in the competitive landscape. We think shows tremendous promise for how the franchise continues into Season 20 and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the team lately. The team are very committed to the game. They're very committed to the community. They're working diligently to offer new types of content and new types of mechanics into the game. And they've put tools in place to test those meaningfully to ensure that, both they're enhancing gameplay. But also that they're fulfilling the needs and motivations of the community. And I'm very encouraged by what we saw out of that collection event. And I'm very encouraged as we go into Season 20 and all the new and interesting things that the team's doing.\nAndrew Marok: Great. Thank you. You kind of led into what was going to be the next part of my question. So, we've seen Apex do some smaller crossover events in the past, but how did the FINAL FANTASY partnership specifically kind of come about? And with the increasing intent kind of in the rest of the states, as you hinted at for a lot of these cross media partnerships, how much room and intent, is there for more of these more substantial crossovers within Apex?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, I think we're still learning and the team is now thinking through, what that might look like. Remember, Apex is this incredible game that has attracted hundreds of millions of people to play. That's tremendous retention in its core. And underneath that core gameplay, which is incredible and what Respawn is known for, is also tremendously deep lore about who these characters are, where these characters come from, and how those characters interact in the world. And so, we have to be very thoughtful about any brand crossovers that we do, to make sure that we're not impeding on the authenticity of the characters or the game in any way. What I think the Final Fantasy crossover did was actually open our eyes to the kinds of things that are possible, and the kind of things that will be super well received by our core fan base and new fans alike. And how that lines up with the core law of the game. And so I would expect that we have more opportunities to do this in the future. But I would also expect that the team will continue to protect both the core game play, the core character set and the core law in the world, what this event does show is we have probably more ability to do things in that direction than we may have thought previously.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, our last question, please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company.\nMichael Hickey: First question is kind of a challenge, Andrew, because it hasn't been announced that we obviously have a fair amount of evidence that the switch to, from Nintendo should come out this year. And from what we know, it's going to be a bigger display, more horsepower. It seems like it is something a platform that would better lend itself to your game. So in as much as you can sort of talk about an opportunity that's not beneficially announced. Just curious if you think you can have more success on that sort of platform that seems better geared towards your games? The second one is sort of, it looks like '25 is not calling an investment year, but most of the growth here is driven by your core games and Live Services. But you look at your longer-term pipeline, you think about Battlefield, Mass Effect, Star Wars, obviously, you've been great in the action genre. I think you're still developing a shooter from Respawn as well. [10 Street] to play maybe user-generated content, licensed properties like Ironman, Black Panther, I mean all of those seem feasible by fiscal '27. So just sort of curious, I know you kind of talked about your longer-term growth opportunity in near term, you focused on leverage, but do you think you're sort of in a position here in the next 2 years to sort of accelerate your top line growth just given how substantial your pipeline appears to be?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. A lot there, and you're a little quiet at the beginning, but I think what you're asking or was suggesting there has been some rumors that Nintendo was doing a new console, and to the extent that I'm able to comment on things that are not yet announced, do I think that might benefit our company and our portfolio? Again, I can absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way. What I would say, though, is, to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution, to the extent those things have happened, where we're able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business. Our players' ability to really experience our games at the highest level has typically worked out very well for us. And so without commenting at all on anything around Nintendo or the Switch, I would just say. New platforms are good for us, where new platforms offer improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution that typically is a plus for our particular portfolio of games and the community that plays them.\nStuart Canfield: Mike, just to kind of tackle your second question. Let's take '25 first, a second, and I'll build it back into the longer-term answer I gave before, and we prepared remarks on as well. So first on '25. So I think the key here is we expect growth in our core business. We're 73% Live Service and obviously have a consistent Full Game Sports release slate, plus we've talked to College coming in the summer next year in 2024. Second, we do have a lighter release slate, which obviously comps to a Star Wars launch and a more expansive sports like where we saw 8 titles released this year. And we've called out also that Battlefield is not in our FY '25 outlook, third, we continue to drive leverage. And I'll just point you to your question around sort of an investment year. You can see sort of by the underlying profitability range that we are still getting scale and leverage by virtue of efficiencies in the business. But also continue to resource and reallocate against some of our bigger growth opportunities. The last one, obviously is just a reminder, we continue to expense costs. So we continue to build into that acceleration that flows into the longer term beyond FY '25 that will be highly beneficial we think of operating leverage to some of the questions we've had earlier. So you kind of put that together. So FY '25, obviously a core business growth. We'll talk more about the details in our Q4 call, lighter slate ongoing scale and leverage from the core business itself and obviously, we expense as we go from an investment perspective. We do expect to see for all the titles in terms of new releases, plus ongoing growth in our core business that we do believe we continue to get accretion and long-term growth and incremental cash flow that accelerates through those following years to the comments we laid out earlier.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for your great questions, really good questions today. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and commitment in delivering incredible interactive entertainment to our growing global communities. And to close, I'd say, we're confident in our ability to deliver value through our accelerated growth, forward operating leverage and increased cash flow over the longer term. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our fiscal year results on May 7. And before we sign off, it would be remiss of me if I didn't congratulate our local Bay Area team, the 49ers for making the Super Bowl hell of a game on Sunday, good luck against the Chiefs in Las Vegas, Go Niners.\nOperator: That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stuart Canfield",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter, we delivered net bookings of $2.37 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or 2% in constant currency, and in line with our expectations. Strength in our live services business, particularly EA SPORTS FC Ultimate Team, was partially offset by some softness in the full game. Live services net bookings grew to a record $1.71 billion in Q3, up 3% year-over-year, or up 5% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations, as we continue to drive healthy engagement and bring new players to our franchises. Full game net bookings of $654 million was down 5% year-over-year, or down 4% in constant currency, versus a high prior year comparable that included the World Cup event. On a trailing 12-month basis, total net bookings was up 8% year-over-year, with live services contributing $5.6 billion, or 73% demonstrating the resilience of this evergreen business model. Building on the strong momentum from our launch at the end of Q2, EA SPORTS FC again exceeded expectations, as EA SPORTS FC Ultimate Team and FC Mobile delivered exceptional double-digit net bookings growth, against a World Cup comparable in the prior year. Our global football business net bookings grew 7% year-over-year, as our teams continue to drive strong retention of our core player base, through the FC brand transition. EA SPORTS Madden NFL, also saw another strong quarter, with net bookings up 5% year-over-year, highlighted by strong engagement trends across full game, Ultimate Team, and mobile. Additional highlights from the third quarter included new releases of EA SPORTS UFC, NHL, and World Rally Championship, which contributed to further expanding the aggregate fandom and strength of our EA SPORTS community, creating additional value-added services in one of the largest sports brands and platforms in the world. In a highly competitive quarter, Apex Legends did not meet our expectations, as our teams continue to learn and iterate with each new season and event. In the past few weeks, our recent cross-over promotion showed early promising signals, delivering two of our highest net bookings days over the fiscal year. With Season 20 launching in February, our teams will deliver more innovation as we continue to build for the long-term. We remain committed to Apex Legends, a proven franchise with loyal fans, and we will continue to invest in opportunities to drive new growth points as we build and expand the franchise over time through engaging a broader base of players. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $1.95 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As we continue to operate with focus and discipline, operating expenses were favorable to our expectations, also benefiting from some phasing of spend to Q4. On a year-over-year basis, operating expenses were up 3%, driven primarily by incremental marketing spend as we invested to support our titles and the EA SPORTS FC transition through the critical holiday season. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, up 47% year-over-year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 13% year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was a record $2.16 billion. And we returned $376 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. We are entering the final quarter of FY '24 well positioned to deliver on our commitments for the fiscal year. With our strong business performance year-to-date, our unrivaled portfolio of IP, and our consistent execution in our core live services business. Even in an incredibly competitive market, we are poised to deliver growth in net bookings consistent with what we outlined at the beginning of the year. At the same time, we are tracking to deliver higher levels of underlying profitability and record free cash flow. We remain deliberate and focused around the prioritization and allocation of resources across our teams and portfolio as we make progress against our long-term strategy to drive durable growth, strong cash flow, and shareholder returns. Turning to our Q4 outlook, I'd like to start by sharing a few key considerations. First, as a reminder, our Q4 net bookings, is impacted by timing, including releases of our full game and content offerings in the prior year. Second, we expect moderated growth in our EA SPORTS FC franchise as we lap record prior year performance. For the full year, we now expect EA SPORTS FC net bookings, to grow mid-to-high single digits, excluding FX. Third, we continue to take a measured approach to Apex Legends in its largest quarter of the year, as we introduce new modes of play and content offerings. And finally, we expect impact from FX to be minimal, as the benefit from more favorable currency exchange rates, is offset by hedging gains from the prior year. As a result, we expect net bookings of $1.625 billion to $1.925 billion, down 16% to down 1% year-over-year, including approximately eight points of impact from the timing noted earlier. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.925 billion and cost of revenue of $360 million to $410 million. We expect operating expenses of $1.125 billion to $1.205 billion, including a $70 million impairment charge of certain acquisition-related intangible assets. This results in GAAP earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.68 for the fourth quarter. Before handing back to Andrew, I'd like to take a moment to share some early perspective on our multiyear growth objectives. EA is in an advantaged position to lead the future of interactive entertainment, with ongoing secular tailwinds and structural shifts within the industry, further amplifying our strategy. Our long-term financial framework is founded upon creating value for our shareholders by accelerating growth, delivering forward operating leverage, and increasing cash flow. In executing on our strategy, we expect to scale operating leverage through the following growth levers: 1) expanded player acquisition, engagement, and retention 2) highly accretive digital and live services 3) blockbuster new releases from our development pipeline, alongside compounding growth across our core franchises, and 4) discipline and focus on aligning our cost structure to invest in support of our strategic growth opportunities. As we look ahead to FY '25, and more specific guidance in our upcoming Q4 earnings call, I wanted to share some initial considerations. Assuming minimal impact to our results from FX, we expect low-single-digit net bookings growth, reflecting continued execution in our core businesses in a lighter release slate year. And excluding any impact from future share repurchases, we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in underlying profitability. Looking beyond FY '25, over the next couple of years, we expect our net bookings growth to accelerate, bolstered by our portfolio of industry-leading IP. Compounding growth within our core Sports franchises, new content and engaging experiences across our massive online communities, and iconic new releases like Battlefield, Sims, and other in-development titles, provide the inflection point that fuels net bookings growth and increases underlying profitability. And we expect to continue to deliver meaningful operating leverage and drive increased cash flow conversion, even as we continue to invest, to support our strategic objectives. In summary, with our incredible talent, industry-leading IP and technology, global and growing communities of fans, and our focus and discipline around our strategic objectives, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth commitments and drive value for our players and for our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more over the coming quarters. Now, I'll hand it back to Andrew. Andrew, this is Stuart. I'll take that. Yes, first of all, the range, as we look forward, we'll continue to be broader, in this case, in the quarter, in part for two reasons. One, it's a more dynamic quarter for us, as you referenced, on our core live services. And the range is that, it reflects the both strength and opportunity we see. So, we're slapping a record World Cup comp for FC, and also is a fiscal high quarter for Apex. The second part, I'd also flag is that, as a reminder on the prepared remarks, is that we have eight points of headwind as well from timing of content released in the prior year. So, hence, the spread between the top and the bottom, is based around the biggest dynamic services we have in the quarter, particularly FC and Apex. And on college football, our expectation is it will be additive. As we think about Madden, Madden is performing incredibly well this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, the biggest game, the biggest sports game in calendar year 2023, we're seeing increased engagement in the game and increased monetization in Ultimate Team as part of that. The team is continuing to invest meaningfully into the modes of Madden and the expansion of Madden as a product and certainly as we look at the NFL broadly and the fan base continue to grow and the incredible season we're having this year, our expectation is that we will invest behind Madden and grow Madden, and that what college football represents as a game that's been 10 years in the waiting for our fans. Is that there's incredible amount of pent up demand and we expect that to be additive to the ecosystem. And over the broad course of time, the way our team thinks about this, is how do we really expand the football community in this country and internationally through a combination of both Madden and college that, we think will be both complementary in gameplay, but overall additive to the ecosystem. And then on subscription, remember we have been early in subscription as a company. We have EA Play as a subscription that exists across platforms. It is part of the Game Pass Ultimate service on Xbox Live as well. I think that we believe, as we look forward that subscription will be a meaningful part of our industry, over the course of time. It hasn't really translated in the same way that a linear television or movie subscription has or a music subscription, just because of the nature of engagement in our content relative to those other mediums. However, as we think about the future, we do believe there is an opportunity to fundamentally disrupt how households consume content broadly. As we look at leaders in a space like Netflix and them leaning into games, as we listen to the performance of Warner Brothers' games division and their conversation around how that might feed into their broader subscription over time. We think we are in an incredibly strong position to continue to lead on subscription, at least as it relates with interactive, because of both the depth and the breadth of our portfolio, which as we look at our portfolio, we believe it is unrivaled in the industry, and spans across many genres, including sport, which of course is a meaningful driver of entertainment value in the coming years. All right. I'll - give a quick position on the financial framing that you just talked to. So yes, sort of in Q3, we actually tracked up 5% at constant currency when you exclude lapping of Apex from the prior year. We did see improvement sequentially. We saw double-digit improvement between Q2 and Q3. Our overall mobile portfolio, as you talked to, you saw the strength that we called out in particular around FC within that mix. We saw double-digit growth year-on-year, as we even entered a World Cup comp. In terms of how we think about mobile, as we move forward. I think we've been very clear on the strategy that, we're focused on, which continues to lean into the success we've seen around FC and our broader ecosystems as both an entry point, and expansion for us in terms of players. We'll continue to lean and focus on those across our biggest opportunities through whether it's FC, Madden, Sims, Battlefield and beyond. Second part is we continue to look for the biggest hits in IP and opportunities that can stand alone on mobile itself. Wrapped inside of an incredibly disciplined approach as we've focused on driving profitability across this platform to some of our more historic levels versus the past. So, those are three kind of profiles we expect. So yes, quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement, strength overall year-on-year with plus 5% and a diligent strategy and approach from us around our biggest opportunities on ecosystems, IP within the platform with mobile itself, and obviously disciplined P&L performance around the business. Mike, just to kind of tackle your second question. Let's take '25 first, a second, and I'll build it back into the longer-term answer I gave before, and we prepared remarks on as well. So first on '25. So I think the key here is we expect growth in our core business. We're 73% Live Service and obviously have a consistent Full Game Sports release slate, plus we've talked to College coming in the summer next year in 2024. Second, we do have a lighter release slate, which obviously comps to a Star Wars launch and a more expansive sports like where we saw 8 titles released this year. And we've called out also that Battlefield is not in our FY '25 outlook, third, we continue to drive leverage. And I'll just point you to your question around sort of an investment year. You can see sort of by the underlying profitability range that we are still getting scale and leverage by virtue of efficiencies in the business. But also continue to resource and reallocate against some of our bigger growth opportunities. The last one, obviously is just a reminder, we continue to expense costs. So we continue to build into that acceleration that flows into the longer term beyond FY '25 that will be highly beneficial we think of operating leverage to some of the questions we've had earlier. So you kind of put that together. So FY '25, obviously a core business growth. We'll talk more about the details in our Q4 call, lighter slate ongoing scale and leverage from the core business itself and obviously, we expense as we go from an investment perspective. We do expect to see for all the titles in terms of new releases, plus ongoing growth in our core business that we do believe we continue to get accretion and long-term growth and incremental cash flow that accelerates through those following years to the comments we laid out earlier."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Katie. It was a strong Q3, as we continue to entertain hundreds of millions of players and fans around the world. Our exceptional teams created high-quality games and experiences across our broad portfolio that, drove deep engagement and record live services. This quarter, two of the world's most celebrated interactive entertainment experiences EA SPORTS FC and EA SPORTS Madden NFL delivered phenomenal strength, as sizable drivers of long-term growth. We are launching amazing games and experiences that entertain massive online communities, create blockbuster interactive storytelling, and harness the power of community in and around our games. EA's Q3 results are a great example of our execution across our strategy. The FC platform is thriving at the center of the action, fandom, and culture of the world's game. The launch of EA SPORTS FC 24 has been a great success and has, once again, outperformed our expectations. Players are connecting, competing, and celebrating global football with their friends, driving strong engagement across FC's multi-experience ecosystem. In Q3, players dove into Ultimate Team, driving double-digit net bookings growth and delivering the franchise's biggest net bookings week ever. FC Mobile also generated deep engagement with daily active users up by 29% year-over-year, while FC Online grew new players by 20% year-over-year. In calendar 2023, Madden NFL was the best-selling sports game in North America and continues to grow. Madden NFL 24, is engaging more players year-over-year through new, innovative gameplay features and compelling live services. In Q3, net bookings grew and engagement with Ultimate Team increased 19%. Madden Mobile also saw an increase in players during the quarter, generating double-digit growth across the community. Our business is gaining momentum as our communities continue to grow and the definition of play rapidly expands, to include watching gameplay, creating user generated content, and connecting with friends and families in and around beloved IP. There are billions of players around the world and this number, is expected to increase as younger generations choose gaming as their number one form of entertainment, generating incredible opportunities, for us to engage and deliver new experiences. The evolving worlds, unfolding stories, and rich characters of our live services are deepening players' relationship with our IP and broadening the global appeal of our portfolio. To further entertain our communities, we are building more ways for them to play, watch, create, and connect to generate growth and longevity in our biggest franchises. The Sims franchise, is the definitive life for simulation experience, offering its multi-generational community incredible ways to connect, create, and express their individuality. During calendar 2023, players have spent an astounding 1.8 billion hours in the Sims 4, a nearly 30% increase from the prior year. We remain committed to the global growth and innovation of this franchise. We're focused on delivering what the community wants most, from ongoing, new content and game modes for the Sims 4, to the social innovation, expansion, and connection in our future Sims release. Millions of passionate fans continue to come together through the nonstop action of Battlefield. The Battlefield 2042 community continues to grow, with total players up 17% year-over-year, and Season 6 live services driving strong engagement with weekly average users up 37% year-over-year. Our team is working hard to deliver for the community with increasingly engaging live services, like the recent announcement of Season 7 with new maps, weekly missions, and much more. In addition, we are making investments in the future of the franchise. Our exceptional teams from multiple world class studios, working with cutting-edge Frostbite technology, are building an expansive, community-focused Battlefield universe for fans all over the world. As a category leader with millions of loyal fans, we are looking forward to celebrating the fifth anniversary of Apex Legends. Over the past few months, we have listened closely to our community, and have deployed new features, new styles of play, and new content. We have also implemented tools, to better understand day-to-day game performance. In Q3, our new modes drove improved engagement, and the early impact of our new content in the current quarter is promising. To generate future growth, we are focused on entertaining core players and engaging new players, by investing in geographic expansion, innovating in the game economy, and making it easier than ever, for players to jump into our gameplay. Turning to FY '25, we will deliver even more excitement and entertainment through an expanded portfolio of connected ecosystems. Industry-leader EA SPORTS will launch a strong core slate of titles and always-on live services, to grow our sports business as a global community and drive value, year-after-year. Our journey building FC, the world's largest interactive platform for global football fans will continue with accelerated gameplay innovation, more social connection, and new brand collaborations to deliver even more value for players. Our teams, working with an incredible roster of partners, are just getting started with FC. We are well positioned to grow this platform as a cultural phenomenon. The momentum in Madden NFL will continue with events and experiences, tied to the biggest moments in the sport, alongside deeper investments in this ecosystem, including leaps in gameplay and deeper fan immersion. In addition to the meaningful advancements in Madden, we are bringing back fan favorite EA SPORTS College Football for the first time in over a decade. Looking further ahead, as more people spend more time playing and connecting in and around our titles, we see incredible potential for growth. Within our online communities, we are expanding blockbuster storytelling through deep, rich characters and new story modes to deliver bigger, broader games and live services. Connected experiences offer new, cutting-edge ways to engage and inspire players, and can unlock future innovative growth opportunities. Over the coming years, we expect accelerated growth in our business. Our long-term outlook coupled with secular tailwinds, drives further conviction in our strategy. By aligning our priorities and investments with our greatest opportunities, we can make the biggest impact and drive long-term value in service of our people, our players, and our shareholders. Now, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business. Thanks, Stuart. I am inspired by the opportunities ahead, as we continue to execute our long-term strategy. Our mission to inspire the world to play is evolving and expanding beyond the traditional bounds of play. Technological advancements are powering creativity and innovation, transforming what we can deliver. We are positioned to bring bigger, broader games and experiences to an even larger global audience in the coming years. Our awesome teams, industry leading technology, world-class IP, and global network of players position EA as a leader of the future of entertainment. Now, Stuart and I are here for your questions. Yes, let me start with this. Let's take a look at sort of the business over the longer term. We're laying out that overarching framework. It's kind of grounded in three pieces, accelerating growth on the top line, expanding leverage on the bottom and increasing cash flow. We're looking at that through a couple of different lenses. So one is, we do expect to continue to drive compounding growth across our core franchises. Plus, we expect to release from our pipeline that's been in development. And both of those will be bolstered, by expanded player acquisition, engagement and retention. As you know, our live services make up almost three quarters of our business, which highlights the evergreen nature of that business model and thus the ability to drive compounded growth, on those franchises through the future. New releases are the second part and they're an important lever for us, on that multi-year growth journey. And we're really flagging, through the long-term journey. They'll create some non-linearity in that growth, in terms of how we accelerate through the later years, depending on timing around that pipeline. Additional context would be that as we continue to drive through live service, and we see greater digital, we get far more accretion through that mix. We're also continuing to be really focused around getting leverage and scale out of OpEx in terms of our cost structure to drive growth. So, we think about those four pieces, core compounding growth across our current core business and live services, a more digital nature around that drives accretion and scale. Add to that the new releases that come through the pipeline, and ongoing management of costs, to ensure that we're investing for the future will ultimately provide leverage over the long-term for us. Hi, Matt. So, I'll quickly touch on the Apple one first. Yes, we're also aware of the intentions to update the European app store tied to their fees. We're still actively reviewing all of those updates and sort of working to understand potential implications to our business and any changes that may flow through from a gross margin perspective. As we gain more insight, understanding, we'll be able to provide a more update sort of next quarter in terms of how that might map through for us and impact gross margin, but no updates, or reflection of that at this point. Yes, great question. Thank you. First and foremost, I would go back to as a core entertainment company, it is always important that, we are developing and investing in new IP, to grow the future pipeline opportunity, that optionality that Stuart referred to earlier. And we have the strongest pipeline, I think we've had in many, many years as we go into those out years in terms of both our core IP and new IP. If we look at the trailing 12-months, both in terms of engagement and monetization, what we do see however, is that the biggest games are these games that really entertain and engage massive online communities. And these are existing franchises that either evolve on a month-by-month cadence, or evolve with annual releases plus live services. And so, as we think about the foundation of growth for our business, we think about FC. Again, this was the first year of FC branding. What we've spoken about in the past few quarters, is having that FC branding and partnering more closely with the core leagues in territory gives us more growth opportunities, than we believe we ever had before. It is building around Madden NFL and expanding the broader college football base, but it's also investing in the Sims and in Apex and in Battlefield. And ultimately some of those as we go down through the next coming years. And so, while we will continue to invest meaningfully behind new IP, and we will be thoughtful and focused on those investments, we see significant opportunity based on how communities are coming together in games, around our biggest franchises, FC, Madden, Sims, Battlefield, Apex. And we will work meaningfully, to expand those over the coming years. Incredible question, and also very insightful. And certainly, as you think about our network, which is well over 700 million right now, about half of that interact with our sports games. And so, as we think about our sports community, it is almost certainly one of the largest collective sports communities on the planet. As we think about EA SPORTS as a brand, we know from brand research around the world. It's also one of the most recognizable and recognized sports brands. And as we think about emerging consumer generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, for many of them, their first relationship with sports comes through their relationship with the leagues and teams and sports they love, as a result of their interaction with their EA SPORTS products. And so, what we know to be true is right now, as we think about our players. They spend on average about 90 minutes a session inside of one of our games. They then leave that game experience, where they've been deeply connected with their core friend unit, and they go and they talk about that experience on another platform. And then they go and create content about, that experience on yet another platform, and then finally, they go and watch that content on another platform. We do believe, we have a meaningful opportunity over the coming years to actually harness the power of that community, both inside and outside of our games, which is really the third pillar of our core strategy, and will be led by our EA SPORTS brand. So again, a super insightful question, nothing to announce today, but you should imagine that we see the very same thing. We see an incredible opportunity by virtue of the breadth and depth of our sports portfolio, the breadth and depth of our sports relationships around the world, which I think are unmatched on a global basis, and certainly the size and magnitude of our sports gaming community, and the relationship they have with their favorite sports through us, but more importantly, the connections that they're making with their friends, as a result of the time they spend with us. We think there's a meaningful opportunity for us to expand on that, both inside the game, and we're seeing that already, in our core products like FC and Madden, but also outside the game. And some of the starting points of that, are some of the deals that we've done with our licensed partners that do allow us to bring highlights, and other non-gaming content into the ecosystem broadly. So, best I can say is watch this space. Yes, again, great questions. I think the relationship between the NFL and the NBA and the likes of ESPN, is super interesting to us. I would think about this on two vectors. One, we have incredible relationships with our sports leagues. Many of them we've had for over 30 years and they have evolved with us, and we have evolved with them. A big part of what we have done through the rebrand of FC, is actually gotten significantly closer to our European Football League partners. And much of what we've done as we have renewed and bolstered those relationships for the next decade, and beyond is really think about, how we can come together in service of fans more broadly, not just fans in the context of interactive gameplay. And part of what you're seeing here as we start to bring highlights into our games and really think about FC as a platform, is kind of testament to that evolution of the nature of our relationship. I do believe that we have the opportunity to do the same, with the NFL and the NBA and you should imagine that we're working very closely with all of our league partners, NHL, UFC, F1, and we see a tremendous opportunity to really think about, EA SPORTS as a platform for engagement, and how we might grow in service of our fans, with our league partners. I would also highlight we've had a relationship with ESPN for the best part of 30 years and have worked very closely with them and continue to work very closely with ESPN and the Walt Disney Company as we think about the future of entertainment broadly. And so, we feel very good about our position in this future. We feel very good about the connection we have with the fans. We feel very good about our opportunity to grow our business as a result of this evolved service opportunity we have with them. I guess - at a macro level we're really, really happy with that event. It was very well received by the community and it actually performed incredibly well. And certainly as we were in what was a very, very competitive quarter, there were a couple of competitive titles that, actually did some really unique and interesting things in the quarter. And so, the performance of Apex with that collection event in the context of some of these other unique things happening in the competitive landscape. We think shows tremendous promise for how the franchise continues into Season 20 and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the team lately. The team are very committed to the game. They're very committed to the community. They're working diligently to offer new types of content and new types of mechanics into the game. And they've put tools in place to test those meaningfully to ensure that, both they're enhancing gameplay. But also that they're fulfilling the needs and motivations of the community. And I'm very encouraged by what we saw out of that collection event. And I'm very encouraged as we go into Season 20 and all the new and interesting things that the team's doing. Yes, I think we're still learning and the team is now thinking through, what that might look like. Remember, Apex is this incredible game that has attracted hundreds of millions of people to play. That's tremendous retention in its core. And underneath that core gameplay, which is incredible and what Respawn is known for, is also tremendously deep lore about who these characters are, where these characters come from, and how those characters interact in the world. And so, we have to be very thoughtful about any brand crossovers that we do, to make sure that we're not impeding on the authenticity of the characters or the game in any way. What I think the Final Fantasy crossover did was actually open our eyes to the kinds of things that are possible, and the kind of things that will be super well received by our core fan base and new fans alike. And how that lines up with the core law of the game. And so I would expect that we have more opportunities to do this in the future. But I would also expect that the team will continue to protect both the core game play, the core character set and the core law in the world, what this event does show is we have probably more ability to do things in that direction than we may have thought previously. Yes. A lot there, and you're a little quiet at the beginning, but I think what you're asking or was suggesting there has been some rumors that Nintendo was doing a new console, and to the extent that I'm able to comment on things that are not yet announced, do I think that might benefit our company and our portfolio? Again, I can absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced or acknowledge it in any way. What I would say, though, is, to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years have come out and offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution, to the extent those things have happened, where we're able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Battlefield, like Apex that has typically been very good for our business. Our players' ability to really experience our games at the highest level has typically worked out very well for us. And so without commenting at all on anything around Nintendo or the Switch, I would just say. New platforms are good for us, where new platforms offer improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution that typically is a plus for our particular portfolio of games and the community that plays them. Okay. Thank you all for being here, and thank you for your great questions, really good questions today. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to our teams for their passion, their hard work and commitment in delivering incredible interactive entertainment to our growing global communities. And to close, I'd say, we're confident in our ability to deliver value through our accelerated growth, forward operating leverage and increased cash flow over the longer term. We look forward to updating you next quarter on our fiscal year results on May 7. And before we sign off, it would be remiss of me if I didn't congratulate our local Bay Area team, the 49ers for making the Super Bowl hell of a game on Sunday, good luck against the Chiefs in Las Vegas, Go Niners."

It\u2019s great to be here with all of you. It was a strong Q2 for EA as we delivered results above our expectations. We are making great progress against our strategy to build massive online communities, tell blockbuster stories, and amplify the power of social connection to drive multi-year growth and unlock long-term value in service of our people, our players, and our shareholders. All our teams through passion and creativity continue to deliver interactive entertainment and experiences that engage and inspire hundreds of millions of people as part of our communities inside our global network. To everyone at EA, thank you. During the quarter, EA SPORTS continued to expand its position as a leader of the future of sports fandom as we launched two of the world\u2019s most celebrated interactive experiences at the heart of sports culture, EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 and EA SPORTS FC 24. These titles represent foundational drivers of growth in the biggest sports year in our company\u2019s history. In Madden NFL, we have delivered the preeminent interactive American Football experience for decades. We know it\u2019s essential for today\u2019s fan as NFL broadcasts grow in popularity and reach to connect with their friends and celebrate their passion for the sport, beyond what happens on the field, each and every day. Through our Madden NFL franchise, we make this possible in ways no one else can, through awesome gameplay, deep social connection and a 365-day immersion in the sport for so many people, with so many different motivations and expressions of their fandom. On console and PC, Madden NFL 24 delivered an immersive experience with elevated realism, control, and gameplay. This has energized our core franchise players, while modes like Superstar are bringing new players to this already giant community. Madden NFL 24 is off to a strong start, with almost 10% more players in the title year-over-year and driving over 10% growth in weekly average users. During the quarter, Madden mobile had more players diving into the game year-over-year, growing the community over 20%, and delivering double-digit growth in weekly active users. As we continued to expand our American football ecosystem, our teams also ushered in a new era for global football at the end of the quarter. The successful launch of EA SPORTS FC represents a profound achievement. We have reimagined and expanded one of the largest franchises in the world, setting new standards of authenticity, innovation, and social interaction. This cutting-edge, multi-experience ecosystem spans console, PC, mobile, and free to play, with a ground-breaking game in FC 24; advancements of FC Mobile and FC Online in Asia; and a new global esports program in FC Pro. Fans, across geographies and generations, are playing, connecting and celebrating in and around these incredible, immersive experiences. Coming off a record-setting FIFA 23 performance amidst two World Cups, FC is set to deliver growth this year and beyond. Fan reception of FC has been extraordinary, expanding our already thriving global football community. Within the first four weeks after world-wide launch, over 14.5 million fans have played FC 24 on console and premium PC, including double-digit growth in new players. FC Mobile has established new franchise records, with over 2 million people installing the game on the first day, over 5 million in the first three days, and over 11 million in the first 10 days. FC Online continues to grow across all engagement metrics, while players have truly embraced FC Pro with a record number of registrations. FC represents a giant leap forward as we aspire to more deeply connect and grow the world\u2019s largest football community to a billion fans and beyond. The successful launch of FC shows our portfolio strategy at work. We are now able to accelerate creativity and innovation across platforms, geographies, and business models; expand our football experiences across play, watch, create, and connect; and inspire and entertain even more fans around the world. We are in an extraordinary position to further collaborate with more amazing partners to grow FC as a cultural phenomenon. FC is more than just a game, and this is just the beginning. Halfway through the year, our sports teams, the very best in the business have delivered an unprecedented slate of amazing content. This story continues into Q3, as EA SPORTS NHL 24 and EA SPORTS UFC 5 have already launched to critical acclaim. The EA SPORTS WRC launch is also just two days away. Looking ahead, exciting updates tied to the biggest moments of the sports season will fuel momentum across our titles through the rest of the fiscal year and beyond, as we build out our multi-platform ecosystems with FC Tactical releasing in 2024 and EA SPORTS College Football coming next summer. As we continue to build ecosystems around our biggest IP, we are prioritizing the massive online communities of our always-on live services to lay a broad foundation for future launches and strong growth for the business. Through the expanding worlds, characters, and storylines that we deliver, people everywhere come together to celebrate their love of games, cherish community, and forge lifelong friendships. Apex Legends is a leader in its category with top game quality and gripping content. In Q2, Season 18 entertained and energized players, driving improvement in monetization over the prior season. We recognize the franchise exists in a competitive environment and, looking forward, our team at Respawn is focused on doing even more incredible things for players, engaging the community and deepening the franchise in exciting ways to drive growth starting with yesterday\u2019s launch of Season 19, featuring dynamic game updates and content integration with music industry icon Post Malone. The Sims 4 community is celebrating creativity and culture and growing across generations. Maxis is using data insights and deep connections with the community to create fan favorite content. New players, as well as weekly average users, are up double digits year-over-year. The team is committed to entertaining and inspiring our Sims 4 community with an increasing amount of new content as they work on a parallel, expansive experience in the Sims universe. Just last month, we launched Season 6 for Battlefield 2042, and our community is responding positively, driving record engagement on Steam. This illustrates the strength today and long-term potential of the franchise. Through innovation and creativity, our teams continue to support this huge community of fans, while building towards the future of Battlefield. Live services are the foundation of our business. Through the first half of the year, we have delivered an impressive amount of content across new games and over 285 game updates. As our teams create even more incredible entertainment, players will find more joy, more inspiration, and deeper connection, powering engagement and expanding our communities. Across geographies and business models, we are driving growth today and over the long-term. While being mindful of current events and varying global macro consumer outlooks, our seasoned teams of leaders and world class teams are focused on doing what they do best, delivering amazing games and services for players everywhere. As we continue to invest in our vision to lead the future of entertainment, we remain thoughtful and deliberate, focusing on our largest opportunities. Over the next few years, our teams will innovate and expand our biggest IP, as we build platforms and ecosystems to connect massive online communities that celebrate fandom across the world; inspire and engage our players through blockbuster storytelling; and continue to create experiences that amplify our communities through social connection. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business.\nStuart Canfield: Thank you, Andrew, and hello everyone. Our strong Q2 performance delivered results exceeding our expectations across net bookings and EPS. We saw growth in our player network, with healthy engagement driving strength in our EA SPORTS portfolio, highlighted by the successful launches of EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 and EA SPORTS FC 24. For the second quarter, net bookings were $1.82 billion, up 4% year-over-year, or 5% in constant currency, which exceeded our expectations for both full game and live services. Our full game net bookings were $691 million, up 9% year-over-year, or up 10% in constant currency, driven by strength in our Q2 EA SPORTS releases. Live services net bookings were $1.13 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or 2% in constant currency. On a trailing twelve-month basis, live services were 73% of our business, demonstrating the resiliency of our evergreen live services business model. EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 delivered a strong launch in the quarter, with net bookings up 6% year-over-year, as exciting new in-game innovations continued to drive growth across player acquisition and engagement. As Andrew noted, the momentous transition to EA SPORTS FC was a huge achievement for EA. In Q2, our total global football business significantly exceeded our expectations. Net bookings grew 41% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum of FIFA 23, including triple-digit mobile net bookings growth, and strong demand for the release of EA SPORTS FC 24. The launch had a tremendous start, highlighted by healthy retention of our core cohort, strong acquisition of new and reactivated players, greater demand for Deluxe editions of FC 24, and the benefit of four extra days of early access. In the first four weeks, FC Ultimate team was up high single digits on a year-on-year basis. Apex Legends, though down on a year-over-year basis, delivered net bookings above our expectations, with Season 18 driving greater-than-anticipated player acquisition and monetization. Apex Legends remains one of the strongest franchises in the industry, and we will continue to invest to engage a broader base of players and drive long-term growth, as the talented teams at Respawn introduce innovations and new offerings, like in Season 19. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $1.91 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Operating expenses came in below our expectations, reflecting savings and the phasing of some marketing spend into the holiday period, as we continued to make progress against focusing and rationalizing our investments. On a year-over-year basis, OpEx was up 7%, primarily driven by the incremental investment behind the launch of EA SPORTS FC. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.47, up 37% year-over-year, including $0.34 from a one-time non-cash tax benefit. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $112 million, including benefit from lower cash taxes. On a trailing twelve-month basis, free cash flow was a record $2 billion, up 28% year over year. And we returned $376 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. To start, I\u2019d like to recap the context and assumptions behind our full-year net bookings guidance range, which remains unchanged. First, we expect healthy player engagement across our portfolio, even as we continue to operate amidst a highly competitive market and a varying macro-backdrop. Second, for EA SPORTS FC, we continue to expect low single-digit growth for the full-year even as we lap record FIFA 23 performance, which included the impact of World Cup events. Third, FX continues to remain volatile. If rates remain unchanged, we expect a two-point headwind to net bookings and six-point headwind to underlying profitability, net of hedges, relative to last year. And finally, we continue to be focused, deliberate, and disciplined on our investments as we execute against our long-term growth opportunities. Our full-year net bookings outlook remains unchanged at $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5% year-over-year, or up 1% to up 7% in constant currency. Our full-year GAAP net revenue outlook of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and our cost of revenue outlook of $1.67 to $1.75 billion also remain unchanged. As we continue to manage and prioritize investments across our portfolio, we are lowering our guidance for operating expenses to $4.21 billion to $4.33 billion, down 2% to up 1% year-over-year, which we also expect to help drive improvements in our underlying profitability. We are increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance to $4.10 to $4.66, up 42% to 62% year-over-year, reflecting operational savings and the one-time tax benefit noted earlier. We are raising our guidance range for operating cash flow by $250 million to $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. We are lowering our capital expenditures outlook to $250 million, driven by deliberate decisions to optimize our real estate footprint. And we now expect free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion, up 27% to 38% on a year-over-year basis. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect net bookings to be $2.25 billion to $2.45 billion, down 4% to up 5% year-over-year, or down 2% to up 6% at constant currency. For EA SPORTS FC 24, we expect modest growth given the World Cup comparable noted earlier, and in Apex Legends, we continue to take a more measured approach as our teams introduce more new modes of play and content offerings. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.83 billion to $2.03 billion, cost of revenue of $495 million to $535 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.05 billion to $1.11 billion. This results in GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $1.01, up 3% percent to 38% year-over-year. In closing, EA delivered a strong Q2 performance, ahead of our expectations, driven by our EA SPORTS launches and strong player engagement across our diverse portfolio of games and services. Looking forward, our teams are committed to delivering high-quality experiences for our players and building upon the momentum in our business, especially as we head into the holiday period. We continue to make progress in aligning around our strategic opportunities; we remain proactive and focused and disciplined in our investments to deliver multiyear growth. Now, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Stuart. Our industry is growing as more people around the world dive into the sports, brands, storytelling, and legendary IP they love most. The definition of a game is also expanding beyond play as fans are watching, creating content, and making deep social connections in and around interactive experiences. How games are being made is changing as well. Advancements in Generative AI are accelerating the speed of development, boosting creativity and innovation, transforming what we can deliver, bringing bigger, broader games and experiences to an even larger global audience. The value and opportunity of delivering deeply interactive entertainment has never been greater. Our talented teams, industry leading technology, world-class IP, and growing global network of players position EA as a leader of the future of entertainment. Now, Stuart and I are here for your questions.\nKatie Burke: Lisa, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess on the launch of EA FC, I guess, what were the areas where you were most pleased with the launch versus last year and the areas where maybe you saw the room for the most improvement? And are you still on track to hit the low single-digit growth of the franchise year-on-year that you had spoken about at the beginning of the year? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks for the question. I would tell you, we are almost universally happy with the launch. Taking on this launch was a big challenge for us, was a challenge for the nature of the game that our teams had to make across platforms, across console, PC, mobile and our free-to-play game that's mostly in Asia. We wanted this to be a symbol of change, not just a change of symbol. And I think the teams have done an extraordinary job in delivering the most authentic, immersive socially connected football experience ever, certainly that we've ever made. I think our marketing teams have done a tremendous job in ensuring that the world's population of football fans understands the transition has happened, understands the benefits of that transition and understands why this represents not the end, but the very beginning of what is going to be an incredible journey of football fandom for our fans and for our partners globally. I think that, if you really sat down with our developers or our marketers or our partners, there are always things we can do better, and we're always learning, but on balance, I would say, we feel very, very proud of what we've achieved so far. It's only early, but certainly, all the signs are incredibly positive, and the feedback is also incredibly positive. And we feel good about where we think the franchise is going from a performance standpoint. Stuart, do you have some more?\nStuart Canfield: Yes, Matt, I'll just add just to clarify. So yes, we remain on track for the low single-digit growth that we represented. I think two important pieces of context. Yes, we're off to a great start. To Andrew's point earlier, we obviously saw strength in Q2. And obviously, importantly, we're seeing \u2013 we're up high-single digits year-on-year through the first four weeks on our live service business. Caveat being, we remain prudent as we head into Q3 and Q4. As you remember from last year, we saw record Q4 across our business, up 31%, but we still feel confident and on track for low single-digit growth for the rest of the year.\nMatthew Cost: Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Another one on FC again, really strong launch so far, so that's encouraging. I'm wondering if you anticipate that the pacing of sales for this game will be similar to prior years. Or if you'd expect any changes to that trend as a result of the rebrand, maybe either more front-end loaded because of some excitement or longer tail because it might take time for some of the marketing to reach people? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I think Stuart can kind of talk about how we're playing that. I think what we're doing right now is we're planning for both of those potential outcomes. We feel very good about the launch so far. We've certainly brought in a meaningful amount of net new fans and net new players in the ecosystem, which is always an incredible sign and prediction for the future. We also know we still have a meaningful amount of people playing the previous game. And as we're starting to see, and it's less about the FC transition and more about our live service business in general, as we think about live services, we're seeing the transition from one launch to the next, be a little bit more organic. And certainly, as we have supported the live services right up until the new launch. There's often very good reason for people to continue playing the previous game. And so I do believe that we brought in new fans through an incredible game experience and incredible marketing, but we also recognize that we still have a meaningful population playing the previous game, and we're now working very deliberately and diligently to bring those over to FC and continue to grow the base of FC on a go-forward basis.\nStuart Canfield: Yes, Ben, just on phasing, I think you've seen a great start. So naturally you've seen us pull forward a little bit through Q2 in the first three weeks, which is natural and part of the strategy as we launched FC. We expect Q3 to operate broadly in a similar manner as we progress through both season and the real world and heading into holiday. We expect Q4 will be more of a tougher comp in part because we had the World Cup pickup from players that flow through into Q4. So macro, yes, stronger start, consistent through Q3 and more of a flat consistency around Q4 given the comp on the prior year.\nBenjamin Soff: Got it. And then on Apex, can you just talk a little bit more about what resonated with players for Season 18 and some of the drivers you see to generate growth for this franchise over the long-term? Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. The team continues to develop incredible content. They're very deeply connected with their fan community. And what we've started to see is different types of content, more dynamic content more content that has application across legends versus being legend specific and different chase mechanics inside the game. Again, there's a deeply committed community, a deeply engaged community and when they come in and see these chase mechanics, it really drives ongoing engagement. And so my expectation is the team will continue to test and learn and continue to innovate and evolve the experience in line with community needs and community demands and community expectations. But what we've seen so far is very positive results to the more dynamic nature of the events and the offers that they've been pushing into the experience.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM.\nEric Handler: Andrew, now that you're not shackled with some of the FIFA restrictions that you have on EA FC. I wonder if you could give a little perspective on what the impact was on revenue for sponsorship and advertising or maybe the impact from promotions?\nAndrew Wilson: Well, it's still really early as we think about the future of this franchise. We are just getting started. But as we talked before, our orientation by transitioning to FC was really about how do we work with more partners around the world in a way they want to work with us. And that's both leagues, teams, players, competitions and commercial partners. It was really about how do we expand the modalities of play inside the game to do new and interesting things for a growing fan base, how to expand engagement opportunities outside the game? How do we really develop FC as a football fan platform, not just an interactive gaming experience and how do we move really, really quickly. We think that with the partner structure that we have now and the many partners that we have around us with the deep connection we have with the community and the investments that we've been making in and around development across the entire ecosystem console, PC, mobile, free-to-play and beyond the bounds of the game is that these things will start to manifest over the coming months, over the coming seasons and over the coming years.\nEric Handler: That's great. And then just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the real estate strategies that you're sort of working through right now?\nStuart Canfield: Eric, I'll chime in here a little bit. We signed this out, and we talked about the restructuring heading out of our Q4 last year. And we continue just to sort of optimize both how we build going forward in both our current footprint today. So ongoing exercise for us, we continue to look at that as we work through the future of work.\nEric Handler: Great. Thank you so much.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. Maybe just one for Stuart. On the operating cash flow outlook, you're taking it up, I think, $250 million on a relatively unchanged operating income outlook. Can you just walk through the puts and takes of that? Are there one-off benefits or should we look at this as an underlying improvement in your conversion? Thanks.\nStuart Canfield: Yes. Thanks, Dave, for the question. In short, yes, we've got a couple of one-off benefits we talked out in the script before. So we have obviously naturally have improved operating foundations and flow of cash benefit from interest we're seeing by virtue of the record cash flow we talked to in our narrative. And then secondly, yes, we're obviously seeing some onetime tax benefits that are flowing through giving us that lift you're talking about, which is $250 million. In addition, we're also obviously changing free cash flow as well to the question before from Eric as we pulled down some of our capital future strategy on investment to increase that up as well. So yes, onetime benefits tied around tax and obviously, some operating benefits picked up by having greater cash at hand that's driving greater interest for us.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, guys. When you think about FC seasonality of spend, has that dynamic shifted any when you look at annual cohorts. We just asked because FIFA engagement was surprisingly robust all the way up to FC launch and with these new FC play modalities, Pro, tactical mobile online, how do you see that impacting spend seasonality, maybe similar along with play styles, all these levers should just broaden out that engagement and spend as well, right?\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. I mean that is our assumption. I mean, this is the biggest sport in the world, and it's growing exponentially. It's growing meaningfully in this country as well, but also globally, it continues to grow. And as we think about the football fan community kind of growing into being of gaming age, we see an opportunity to serve them across a bunch of different vectors. And so as we think about the value of FC as a platform, it really comes down to three things. One is how many people are in the network and playing, how much time are they playing in the context of that engagement and how deep are the connections they have with those that they play with? And as you look at our strategy as we roll that out across platforms, across modalities, across geographies and across business models, everything we are doing, we are looking to pull on those levers that bring more fans into the community and give them more opportunities to engage deeply with the experiences that we create and connect more meaningfully with the friends that they enjoy those experiences with and what that has meant is just an overall expansion of the opportunity, both in terms of how many people are in the community broadly and the overall seasonality of spend has been elongated throughout the year. And so we're seeing far more consistent spend throughout the year because it's not just about the connection to a season of football. It's about a deep connection to the friends they share the love of that season of football with, and that love is 365 days a year. And so as we think about building this out both in the context of FC in the context of American football, in the context of our broader EA SPORTS portfolio and in the context of our other Giant IP, Apex, The Sims, Battlefield, you should expect that we will look to replicate this across the portfolio as we invest deeply in these opportunities to bring global communities of gamers together and give them opportunity to engage more deeply in the experiences they love and connect more meaningfully with their friends that they enjoy the experiences with.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate it.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much. Maybe two questions, if I can. First, we continue to have a debate with investors about the recession resilience versus of gaming overall as an industry. I was curious what you're seeing in terms of spending habits on the consumer side of the equation across your portfolio of IP and what it tells you in terms of resilience versus resistance to potential in consumer volatility from a spending side when you think about the interactive entertainment landscape, number one. And then number two, it\u2019s really interesting to see the new user growth around the Madden franchise, where there's been sort of a geographic component to that IP over time because of the sport itself. How do you think about building more audience scale and size in Madden over the long-term? What were some of the key learnings from this year, the job to take into future years? Thanks so much.\nAndrew Wilson: Well, Eric, two great questions. I will try and cover them as best as I can and Stuart, please add details as we go. I think that when we think about recessionary predictions and the industry broadly, typically as an industry we have. I don't want to say, be recession-proof, but we have been more resilient than many industries have been and that's really because of two key things. One entertainment is a fundamental human need. It's very important to us as a species. And two, the form of entertainment that we offer to our communities represents incredible value even where there is constrained spending. As we look at the market today and we look across our portfolio, I think it probably is pretty consistent with what we see across the industry, which is the big games where there is deep engagement and deep social connection continue to benefit across our portfolio. And we are \u2013 but we do see different kind of spend patterns on a geo basis. There are some markets that are showing a little more softness than others relative to some of the growth that we're seeing across the world. We've heard others speak to some of the softness in market in Europe. We've certainly seen some of that across our portfolio. But in aggregate, on a global basis, we're seeing growth. As we think about Madden broadly, again, I just \u2013 I think we have been partners with the NFL for the best part of 30 years. Our teams work very, very closely with the NFL and the NFL Players Association and more importantly, NFL fans, football fans in this country and beyond the boundaries of this country. And the NFL is growing globally, and we see the NFL doing an incredible job of growing the sport and what our teams have been doing is building out again, thinking about these game experiences not just as one-off onetime experiences, but mechanisms to fulfill many motivations of sports fans and football fans. And those might be core gaming moments. Those might be more play trade moments, there might be more casual moments, there might be more arcade-like moments or there might just be moments to connect with other fans of the community. And what you're seeing from our teams right now is a deep commitment to fulfilling the needs and motivations what is a growing fan community for American football in this country and beyond. And I expect that we'll continue to work with the NFL and the NFL Players Association, our partners and the community broadly to continue to grow the business.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you, Andrew.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. That ends our call. Andrew, do you have a few closing words?\nAndrew Wilson: Thank you all for being with us and for the great questions. Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our incredible teams for delivering a really strong Q2. We look forward to updating you next quarter on January 30.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stuart Canfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and hello everyone. Our strong Q2 performance delivered results exceeding our expectations across net bookings and EPS. We saw growth in our player network, with healthy engagement driving strength in our EA SPORTS portfolio, highlighted by the successful launches of EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 and EA SPORTS FC 24. For the second quarter, net bookings were $1.82 billion, up 4% year-over-year, or 5% in constant currency, which exceeded our expectations for both full game and live services. Our full game net bookings were $691 million, up 9% year-over-year, or up 10% in constant currency, driven by strength in our Q2 EA SPORTS releases. Live services net bookings were $1.13 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or 2% in constant currency. On a trailing twelve-month basis, live services were 73% of our business, demonstrating the resiliency of our evergreen live services business model. EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 delivered a strong launch in the quarter, with net bookings up 6% year-over-year, as exciting new in-game innovations continued to drive growth across player acquisition and engagement. As Andrew noted, the momentous transition to EA SPORTS FC was a huge achievement for EA. In Q2, our total global football business significantly exceeded our expectations. Net bookings grew 41% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum of FIFA 23, including triple-digit mobile net bookings growth, and strong demand for the release of EA SPORTS FC 24. The launch had a tremendous start, highlighted by healthy retention of our core cohort, strong acquisition of new and reactivated players, greater demand for Deluxe editions of FC 24, and the benefit of four extra days of early access. In the first four weeks, FC Ultimate team was up high single digits on a year-on-year basis. Apex Legends, though down on a year-over-year basis, delivered net bookings above our expectations, with Season 18 driving greater-than-anticipated player acquisition and monetization. Apex Legends remains one of the strongest franchises in the industry, and we will continue to invest to engage a broader base of players and drive long-term growth, as the talented teams at Respawn introduce innovations and new offerings, like in Season 19. Moving to our GAAP results, we delivered net revenue of $1.91 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Operating expenses came in below our expectations, reflecting savings and the phasing of some marketing spend into the holiday period, as we continued to make progress against focusing and rationalizing our investments. On a year-over-year basis, OpEx was up 7%, primarily driven by the incremental investment behind the launch of EA SPORTS FC. Our GAAP earnings per share was $1.47, up 37% year-over-year, including $0.34 from a one-time non-cash tax benefit. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $112 million, including benefit from lower cash taxes. On a trailing twelve-month basis, free cash flow was a record $2 billion, up 28% year over year. And we returned $376 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program. Now, turning to guidance. To start, I'd like to recap the context and assumptions behind our full-year net bookings guidance range, which remains unchanged. First, we expect healthy player engagement across our portfolio, even as we continue to operate amidst a highly competitive market and a varying macro-backdrop. Second, for EA SPORTS FC, we continue to expect low single-digit growth for the full-year even as we lap record FIFA 23 performance, which included the impact of World Cup events. Third, FX continues to remain volatile. If rates remain unchanged, we expect a two-point headwind to net bookings and six-point headwind to underlying profitability, net of hedges, relative to last year. And finally, we continue to be focused, deliberate, and disciplined on our investments as we execute against our long-term growth opportunities. Our full-year net bookings outlook remains unchanged at $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5% year-over-year, or up 1% to up 7% in constant currency. Our full-year GAAP net revenue outlook of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and our cost of revenue outlook of $1.67 to $1.75 billion also remain unchanged. As we continue to manage and prioritize investments across our portfolio, we are lowering our guidance for operating expenses to $4.21 billion to $4.33 billion, down 2% to up 1% year-over-year, which we also expect to help drive improvements in our underlying profitability. We are increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance to $4.10 to $4.66, up 42% to 62% year-over-year, reflecting operational savings and the one-time tax benefit noted earlier. We are raising our guidance range for operating cash flow by $250 million to $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion. We are lowering our capital expenditures outlook to $250 million, driven by deliberate decisions to optimize our real estate footprint. And we now expect free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.85 billion, up 27% to 38% on a year-over-year basis. Please see our earnings slides and press release for further cash flow information. Turning to the third quarter outlook, we expect net bookings to be $2.25 billion to $2.45 billion, down 4% to up 5% year-over-year, or down 2% to up 6% at constant currency. For EA SPORTS FC 24, we expect modest growth given the World Cup comparable noted earlier, and in Apex Legends, we continue to take a more measured approach as our teams introduce more new modes of play and content offerings. We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.83 billion to $2.03 billion, cost of revenue of $495 million to $535 million, and operating expenses of approximately $1.05 billion to $1.11 billion. This results in GAAP earnings per share of $0.75 to $1.01, up 3% percent to 38% year-over-year. In closing, EA delivered a strong Q2 performance, ahead of our expectations, driven by our EA SPORTS launches and strong player engagement across our diverse portfolio of games and services. Looking forward, our teams are committed to delivering high-quality experiences for our players and building upon the momentum in our business, especially as we head into the holiday period. We continue to make progress in aligning around our strategic opportunities; we remain proactive and focused and disciplined in our investments to deliver multiyear growth. Now, I'll hand it back to Andrew. Yes, Matt, I'll just add just to clarify. So yes, we remain on track for the low single-digit growth that we represented. I think two important pieces of context. Yes, we're off to a great start. To Andrew's point earlier, we obviously saw strength in Q2. And obviously, importantly, we're seeing \u2013 we're up high-single digits year-on-year through the first four weeks on our live service business. Caveat being, we remain prudent as we head into Q3 and Q4. As you remember from last year, we saw record Q4 across our business, up 31%, but we still feel confident and on track for low single-digit growth for the rest of the year. Yes, Ben, just on phasing, I think you've seen a great start. So naturally you've seen us pull forward a little bit through Q2 in the first three weeks, which is natural and part of the strategy as we launched FC. We expect Q3 to operate broadly in a similar manner as we progress through both season and the real world and heading into holiday. We expect Q4 will be more of a tougher comp in part because we had the World Cup pickup from players that flow through into Q4. So macro, yes, stronger start, consistent through Q3 and more of a flat consistency around Q4 given the comp on the prior year. Eric, I'll chime in here a little bit. We signed this out, and we talked about the restructuring heading out of our Q4 last year. And we continue just to sort of optimize both how we build going forward in both our current footprint today. So ongoing exercise for us, we continue to look at that as we work through the future of work. Yes. Thanks, Dave, for the question. In short, yes, we've got a couple of one-off benefits we talked out in the script before. So we have obviously naturally have improved operating foundations and flow of cash benefit from interest we're seeing by virtue of the record cash flow we talked to in our narrative. And then secondly, yes, we're obviously seeing some onetime tax benefits that are flowing through giving us that lift you're talking about, which is $250 million. In addition, we're also obviously changing free cash flow as well to the question before from Eric as we pulled down some of our capital future strategy on investment to increase that up as well. So yes, onetime benefits tied around tax and obviously, some operating benefits picked up by having greater cash at hand that's driving greater interest for us."

            "name": "Andrew Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Katie. It's great to be here with all of you. It was a strong Q2 for EA as we delivered results above our expectations. We are making great progress against our strategy to build massive online communities, tell blockbuster stories, and amplify the power of social connection to drive multi-year growth and unlock long-term value in service of our people, our players, and our shareholders. All our teams through passion and creativity continue to deliver interactive entertainment and experiences that engage and inspire hundreds of millions of people as part of our communities inside our global network. To everyone at EA, thank you. During the quarter, EA SPORTS continued to expand its position as a leader of the future of sports fandom as we launched two of the world's most celebrated interactive experiences at the heart of sports culture, EA SPORTS Madden NFL 24 and EA SPORTS FC 24. These titles represent foundational drivers of growth in the biggest sports year in our company's history. In Madden NFL, we have delivered the preeminent interactive American Football experience for decades. We know it's essential for today's fan as NFL broadcasts grow in popularity and reach to connect with their friends and celebrate their passion for the sport, beyond what happens on the field, each and every day. Through our Madden NFL franchise, we make this possible in ways no one else can, through awesome gameplay, deep social connection and a 365-day immersion in the sport for so many people, with so many different motivations and expressions of their fandom. On console and PC, Madden NFL 24 delivered an immersive experience with elevated realism, control, and gameplay. This has energized our core franchise players, while modes like Superstar are bringing new players to this already giant community. Madden NFL 24 is off to a strong start, with almost 10% more players in the title year-over-year and driving over 10% growth in weekly average users. During the quarter, Madden mobile had more players diving into the game year-over-year, growing the community over 20%, and delivering double-digit growth in weekly active users. As we continued to expand our American football ecosystem, our teams also ushered in a new era for global football at the end of the quarter. The successful launch of EA SPORTS FC represents a profound achievement. We have reimagined and expanded one of the largest franchises in the world, setting new standards of authenticity, innovation, and social interaction. This cutting-edge, multi-experience ecosystem spans console, PC, mobile, and free to play, with a ground-breaking game in FC 24; advancements of FC Mobile and FC Online in Asia; and a new global esports program in FC Pro. Fans, across geographies and generations, are playing, connecting and celebrating in and around these incredible, immersive experiences. Coming off a record-setting FIFA 23 performance amidst two World Cups, FC is set to deliver growth this year and beyond. Fan reception of FC has been extraordinary, expanding our already thriving global football community. Within the first four weeks after world-wide launch, over 14.5 million fans have played FC 24 on console and premium PC, including double-digit growth in new players. FC Mobile has established new franchise records, with over 2 million people installing the game on the first day, over 5 million in the first three days, and over 11 million in the first 10 days. FC Online continues to grow across all engagement metrics, while players have truly embraced FC Pro with a record number of registrations. FC represents a giant leap forward as we aspire to more deeply connect and grow the world's largest football community to a billion fans and beyond. The successful launch of FC shows our portfolio strategy at work. We are now able to accelerate creativity and innovation across platforms, geographies, and business models; expand our football experiences across play, watch, create, and connect; and inspire and entertain even more fans around the world. We are in an extraordinary position to further collaborate with more amazing partners to grow FC as a cultural phenomenon. FC is more than just a game, and this is just the beginning. Halfway through the year, our sports teams, the very best in the business have delivered an unprecedented slate of amazing content. This story continues into Q3, as EA SPORTS NHL 24 and EA SPORTS UFC 5 have already launched to critical acclaim. The EA SPORTS WRC launch is also just two days away. Looking ahead, exciting updates tied to the biggest moments of the sports season will fuel momentum across our titles through the rest of the fiscal year and beyond, as we build out our multi-platform ecosystems with FC Tactical releasing in 2024 and EA SPORTS College Football coming next summer. As we continue to build ecosystems around our biggest IP, we are prioritizing the massive online communities of our always-on live services to lay a broad foundation for future launches and strong growth for the business. Through the expanding worlds, characters, and storylines that we deliver, people everywhere come together to celebrate their love of games, cherish community, and forge lifelong friendships. Apex Legends is a leader in its category with top game quality and gripping content. In Q2, Season 18 entertained and energized players, driving improvement in monetization over the prior season. We recognize the franchise exists in a competitive environment and, looking forward, our team at Respawn is focused on doing even more incredible things for players, engaging the community and deepening the franchise in exciting ways to drive growth starting with yesterday's launch of Season 19, featuring dynamic game updates and content integration with music industry icon Post Malone. The Sims 4 community is celebrating creativity and culture and growing across generations. Maxis is using data insights and deep connections with the community to create fan favorite content. New players, as well as weekly average users, are up double digits year-over-year. The team is committed to entertaining and inspiring our Sims 4 community with an increasing amount of new content as they work on a parallel, expansive experience in the Sims universe. Just last month, we launched Season 6 for Battlefield 2042, and our community is responding positively, driving record engagement on Steam. This illustrates the strength today and long-term potential of the franchise. Through innovation and creativity, our teams continue to support this huge community of fans, while building towards the future of Battlefield. Live services are the foundation of our business. Through the first half of the year, we have delivered an impressive amount of content across new games and over 285 game updates. As our teams create even more incredible entertainment, players will find more joy, more inspiration, and deeper connection, powering engagement and expanding our communities. Across geographies and business models, we are driving growth today and over the long-term. While being mindful of current events and varying global macro consumer outlooks, our seasoned teams of leaders and world class teams are focused on doing what they do best, delivering amazing games and services for players everywhere. As we continue to invest in our vision to lead the future of entertainment, we remain thoughtful and deliberate, focusing on our largest opportunities. Over the next few years, our teams will innovate and expand our biggest IP, as we build platforms and ecosystems to connect massive online communities that celebrate fandom across the world; inspire and engage our players through blockbuster storytelling; and continue to create experiences that amplify our communities through social connection. Now, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business. Thanks, Stuart. Our industry is growing as more people around the world dive into the sports, brands, storytelling, and legendary IP they love most. The definition of a game is also expanding beyond play as fans are watching, creating content, and making deep social connections in and around interactive experiences. How games are being made is changing as well. Advancements in Generative AI are accelerating the speed of development, boosting creativity and innovation, transforming what we can deliver, bringing bigger, broader games and experiences to an even larger global audience. The value and opportunity of delivering deeply interactive entertainment has never been greater. Our talented teams, industry leading technology, world-class IP, and growing global network of players position EA as a leader of the future of entertainment. Now, Stuart and I are here for your questions. Thanks for the question. I would tell you, we are almost universally happy with the launch. Taking on this launch was a big challenge for us, was a challenge for the nature of the game that our teams had to make across platforms, across console, PC, mobile and our free-to-play game that's mostly in Asia. We wanted this to be a symbol of change, not just a change of symbol. And I think the teams have done an extraordinary job in delivering the most authentic, immersive socially connected football experience ever, certainly that we've ever made. I think our marketing teams have done a tremendous job in ensuring that the world's population of football fans understands the transition has happened, understands the benefits of that transition and understands why this represents not the end, but the very beginning of what is going to be an incredible journey of football fandom for our fans and for our partners globally. I think that, if you really sat down with our developers or our marketers or our partners, there are always things we can do better, and we're always learning, but on balance, I would say, we feel very, very proud of what we've achieved so far. It's only early, but certainly, all the signs are incredibly positive, and the feedback is also incredibly positive. And we feel good about where we think the franchise is going from a performance standpoint. Stuart, do you have some more? Yes. I think Stuart can kind of talk about how we're playing that. I think what we're doing right now is we're planning for both of those potential outcomes. We feel very good about the launch so far. We've certainly brought in a meaningful amount of net new fans and net new players in the ecosystem, which is always an incredible sign and prediction for the future. We also know we still have a meaningful amount of people playing the previous game. And as we're starting to see, and it's less about the FC transition and more about our live service business in general, as we think about live services, we're seeing the transition from one launch to the next, be a little bit more organic. And certainly, as we have supported the live services right up until the new launch. There's often very good reason for people to continue playing the previous game. And so I do believe that we brought in new fans through an incredible game experience and incredible marketing, but we also recognize that we still have a meaningful population playing the previous game, and we're now working very deliberately and diligently to bring those over to FC and continue to grow the base of FC on a go-forward basis. Yes. The team continues to develop incredible content. They're very deeply connected with their fan community. And what we've started to see is different types of content, more dynamic content more content that has application across legends versus being legend specific and different chase mechanics inside the game. Again, there's a deeply committed community, a deeply engaged community and when they come in and see these chase mechanics, it really drives ongoing engagement. And so my expectation is the team will continue to test and learn and continue to innovate and evolve the experience in line with community needs and community demands and community expectations. But what we've seen so far is very positive results to the more dynamic nature of the events and the offers that they've been pushing into the experience. Well, it's still really early as we think about the future of this franchise. We are just getting started. But as we talked before, our orientation by transitioning to FC was really about how do we work with more partners around the world in a way they want to work with us. And that's both leagues, teams, players, competitions and commercial partners. It was really about how do we expand the modalities of play inside the game to do new and interesting things for a growing fan base, how to expand engagement opportunities outside the game? How do we really develop FC as a football fan platform, not just an interactive gaming experience and how do we move really, really quickly. We think that with the partner structure that we have now and the many partners that we have around us with the deep connection we have with the community and the investments that we've been making in and around development across the entire ecosystem console, PC, mobile, free-to-play and beyond the bounds of the game is that these things will start to manifest over the coming months, over the coming seasons and over the coming years. Yes. I mean that is our assumption. I mean, this is the biggest sport in the world, and it's growing exponentially. It's growing meaningfully in this country as well, but also globally, it continues to grow. And as we think about the football fan community kind of growing into being of gaming age, we see an opportunity to serve them across a bunch of different vectors. And so as we think about the value of FC as a platform, it really comes down to three things. One is how many people are in the network and playing, how much time are they playing in the context of that engagement and how deep are the connections they have with those that they play with? And as you look at our strategy as we roll that out across platforms, across modalities, across geographies and across business models, everything we are doing, we are looking to pull on those levers that bring more fans into the community and give them more opportunities to engage deeply with the experiences that we create and connect more meaningfully with the friends that they enjoy those experiences with and what that has meant is just an overall expansion of the opportunity, both in terms of how many people are in the community broadly and the overall seasonality of spend has been elongated throughout the year. And so we're seeing far more consistent spend throughout the year because it's not just about the connection to a season of football. It's about a deep connection to the friends they share the love of that season of football with, and that love is 365 days a year. And so as we think about building this out both in the context of FC in the context of American football, in the context of our broader EA SPORTS portfolio and in the context of our other Giant IP, Apex, The Sims, Battlefield, you should expect that we will look to replicate this across the portfolio as we invest deeply in these opportunities to bring global communities of gamers together and give them opportunity to engage more deeply in the experiences they love and connect more meaningfully with their friends that they enjoy the experiences with. Well, Eric, two great questions. I will try and cover them as best as I can and Stuart, please add details as we go. I think that when we think about recessionary predictions and the industry broadly, typically as an industry we have. I don't want to say, be recession-proof, but we have been more resilient than many industries have been and that's really because of two key things. One entertainment is a fundamental human need. It's very important to us as a species. And two, the form of entertainment that we offer to our communities represents incredible value even where there is constrained spending. As we look at the market today and we look across our portfolio, I think it probably is pretty consistent with what we see across the industry, which is the big games where there is deep engagement and deep social connection continue to benefit across our portfolio. And we are \u2013 but we do see different kind of spend patterns on a geo basis. There are some markets that are showing a little more softness than others relative to some of the growth that we're seeing across the world. We've heard others speak to some of the softness in market in Europe. We've certainly seen some of that across our portfolio. But in aggregate, on a global basis, we're seeing growth. As we think about Madden broadly, again, I just \u2013 I think we have been partners with the NFL for the best part of 30 years. Our teams work very, very closely with the NFL and the NFL Players Association and more importantly, NFL fans, football fans in this country and beyond the boundaries of this country. And the NFL is growing globally, and we see the NFL doing an incredible job of growing the sport and what our teams have been doing is building out again, thinking about these game experiences not just as one-off onetime experiences, but mechanisms to fulfill many motivations of sports fans and football fans. And those might be core gaming moments. Those might be more play trade moments, there might be more casual moments, there might be more arcade-like moments or there might just be moments to connect with other fans of the community. And what you're seeing from our teams right now is a deep commitment to fulfilling the needs and motivations what is a growing fan community for American football in this country and beyond. And I expect that we'll continue to work with the NFL and the NFL Players Association, our partners and the community broadly to continue to grow the business. Thank you all for being with us and for the great questions. Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our incredible teams for delivering a really strong Q2. We look forward to updating you next quarter on January 30."

It was a record Q1 for EA with net bookings of $1.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by sustained momentum across the entire EA SPORTS FIFA ecosystem and the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. During the quarter we executed across our business, launching five new high-quality titles, while providing over 145 content updates across 37 titles. Our teams continue to create the entertainment and experiences that inspire, engage, and connect hundreds of millions of players. To every EA employee, for all that you do for our communities, thank you. EA SPORTS FIFA had the biggest Q1 in our company\u2019s history. The franchise continues to deliver compelling content to our growing community, driving strong engagement and accelerating net bookings growth. FIFA Ultimate Team engaged tens of millions of fans and daily average users grew 15 %. FIFA Mobile attracted over 65 million new players in the quarter alone. FIFA Online produced double-digit growth across monthly, weekly and daily average users. These remarkable results are a testament to our incredible teams executing against our strategy sharpened by 30-years of passion, innovation, and leadership in interactive football. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is pure blockbuster entertainment, rooted in a timeless, culture-defining IP. Our team at Respawn proudly launched this title to critical acclaim and commercial success. Millions of players have already engaged with the game, making this one of the biggest events in the Star Wars galaxy this year. Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1. Over the coming year, we will harness the community\u2019s passion and capitalize on key Star Wars franchise moments to drive continued engagement for this incredible game. Since going free to enter, The Sims 4 community continues to reach a broader global audience, welcoming over 4 million new players in the quarter. In addition to continuing to deliver new content and experiences to expand The Sims 4, the Maxis team is developing a new, innovative parallel experience that will ignite the imaginations of the next generation of players. In Q1, our mobile business delivered ahead of our expectations, driven by outperformance across our broad portfolio, including FIFA Mobile, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and The Sims FreePlay. Over the last year, we focused and refined our approach to mobile. We are excited to see the results as we continue to drive for long-term profitable growth. During the quarter, we launched Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth. Based on strong metrics, the team is tuning and balancing the game to scale user acquisition and promotion in the coming months. Apex Legends is one of the strongest franchises and live services in the industry with 18 million active monthly players and an impressive retention rate of over 70%. After a highly successful 16th season, we launched Season 17 in May with new variations of gameplay and monetization. While this new season did not meet our financial expectations, the team has applied important learnings, including new game mechanics to engage and retain players, which are already generating momentum. We will continue to reinforce the strengths of this franchise by introducing new modes of play and investing in regional marketing, as well as culturalization in key markets. Looking forward, I\u2019ve never been more excited for what\u2019s to come, as we head into the biggest sports season in our company\u2019s history. As the world\u2019s preeminent interactive American football experience, Madden NFL continues to deliver higher engagement year-over-year, an indicator of future success. This franchise is one of the most powerful IPs in all of sports and is at the center of football culture, bringing the community together in our game and beyond. We are building on a tidal wave of community excitement after the reveal of Josh Allen as Madden NFL 24\u2019s cover athlete. This completely new experience will offer more fun, more immersive gameplay, and for the first time ever cross-play to amplify the power of community as we build a connected multi-platform ecosystem around American football. On July 13th, we unveiled our vision for a new era of global football with EA SPORTS FC 24. Alongside this amazing title, we announced advancements of FC Mobile and FC Online in Asia, as well as new experiences FC Tactical mobile and FC Pro esports. This was the biggest reveal we\u2019ve ever had, generating almost double the positive worldwide response to FIFA 23\u2019s debut. Over 2.5 million people have watched the event live and on demand so far, an amazing celebration for the global football community. To secure a fan-first future for FC, we have announced new long-term, global partnerships with UEFA, The Premier League, LaLiga, Frauen-Bundesliga, Liga F, and many more. With these recent announcements, alongside our existing and ongoing network of partnerships, the game will showcase 19,000 fully licensed footballers, 700 squads, 30 leagues, and the biggest competitions. As a result, FC 24 is the most authentic, interactive football experience ever created. It\u2019s also a massive leap forward in gameplay innovation with a trio of cutting-edge technologies: Hypermotion V, PlayStyles by Opta and a revolutionized Frostbite engine. The highly anticipated release of FC 24 in September is the first giant step toward realizing a multi-experience global platform capable of connecting over a billion fans. To do more extraordinary things for our people, players and communities, our teams are building the strongest pipeline in the history of EA to drive multi-year growth. Over the next few years, we will launch numerous experiences that grow and deepen the fandom of our legendary IP. Our multi-year targeted investments toward our biggest opportunities include global titles like blockbuster storytelling from Dragon Age, incredible skateboarding gameplay and social connection from skate, and a revival of EA SPORTS College Football that celebrates the action, culture and tradition of the sport like never before. We\u2019re also hard at work on a new experience from The Sims that will transform what players can do with creativity, a sprawling action/adventure Iron Man game, a reimagination of Battlefield as a truly connected ecosystem, and the expansion of the Apex Legends universe across platforms, geographies, and modalities of play. The most recent reveal of our Black Panther project set in a massive, explorable universe marks the latest chapter in EA\u2019s collaboration with The Walt Disney Company and the Marvel Games team. To drive player engagement and deliver return for our shareholders, we will build unrivaled IPdriven platforms that entertain massive online communities, tell blockbuster stories, and amplify the power of community in and around our games. Being thoughtful and deliberate around feature sets, launch timing, and quality will lead to long-term profitability as we invest in our vision and lead the future of entertainment. Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business.\nStuart Canfield: Thanks Andrew, and hello to everyone. I\u2019m honored to be on my first earnings call in my new role as Chief Financial Officer. Throughout my twenty-year career at EA, I have been and continue to be inspired by our talented teams and the entertainment and experiences they create for our players. I am excited by our future, and I have great conviction that our strategy and teams will help us achieve our ambitions to lead the future of entertainment. Turning to our business, we continue to see healthy engagement and new player acquisition across our portfolio and have started the year strong. Today, we are reaffirming our full year net bookings outlook. I\u2019ll now speak to our Q1 results. Net bookings were $1.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, or 25% in constant currency, primarily driven by continued strength in EA SPORTS FIFA and the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. This is the second record quarter in a row for EA SPORTS FIFA, with year-over-year growth accelerating from Q4, as this entire franchise continues to demonstrate the strategic potential of a connected massive online community. Our full game net bookings were $401 million, up 143% year-over-year, or 152% in constant currency, primarily driven by the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As Andrew noted, the title was a critical success, with performance in line with our expectations. Based on the strength of the IP, the engaging gameplay, and new ways to bring the title to players, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will continue to deliver long-term value. Our live services were up 4% year over year, or 7% in constant currency. Even in a quarter with such strength in full game, live services, which demonstrates a highly resilient, re-occurring business model, were 75% of total net bookings. With ongoing innovation in EA SPORTS FIFA, Ultimate Team remains a material growth engine for our live services business, with strength across acquisition, engagement, and monetization. In mobile, net bookings were up 3% year over year, or 5% in constant currency, excluding the impact of lapping the sunset of Apex Mobile. We continue to make material progress across our portfolio as we manage our business for long-term profitability. FIFA Mobile delivered record Q1 net bookings, almost doubling from the year prior, driven by historic levels of player engagement and new player acquisition. And although early in our launch, initial metrics are promising for our new title Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth. Apex Legends is a highly successful original IP for EA with a strong community of loyal core players. This quarter, net bookings were below expectations largely driven by underperformance from Season 17. As an evergreen live service that is constantly evolving, our teams continue to innovate on content and introduce new modes of play to engage a broader base of players across different geographies. To echo Andrew, we will continue to invest behind the talented team at Respawn to drive long-term expansion and growth of the franchise. On a GAAP basis, we delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Operating expenses were roughly flat and below our expectations, as we shifted marketing spend for new releases, primarily EA Sports FC, to later in the year. As a result, earnings per share was $1.47, up 32% year-over-year. We delivered operating cash flow of $359 million, one of our largest ever Q1 results, and returned $377 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow is up 2% year-over-year. Now, turning to guidance. Let me start by sharing our assumptions as we think about Q2. First, our guidance assumes continuing momentum in our existing global football business in addition to a strong launch for EA SPORTS FC late in the quarter. Second, we are taking a more measured approach for Apex Legends as the teams apply learnings from Season 17 and introduce new modes of play across various markets. Third, we plan to heavily invest ahead of the launch of the fan platform for the global football community EA SPORTS FC. And finally, as a reminder, net of hedges relative to last year, we continue to expect FX headwinds. As a result of these assumptions, we expect Q2 net bookings of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, down 3% to up 3%, or down 2% to up 4% in constant currency. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion, and cost of revenue to be $430 million to $450 million. We expect GAAP operating expenses in Q2 to be between $1.11 billion and $1.12 billion, up 9% to 10%, driven by marketing investment noted earlier. And we expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.72 to $0.89. Now, turning to the full-year. We are reaffirming our full-year net bookings guidance range of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5%, or up 1% to up 6% in constant currency. We are revising our GAAP operating expenses guidance range to $4.25 to $4.37 billion, driven largely by reductions in stock based compensation. As a result, our earnings per share guidance range is now $3.42 to $3.92. We are reaffirming our guidance for our other full-year metrics. We expect operating cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and capital expenditures of around $275 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. To conclude, our strong first quarter is a testament to our incredible brands, our evergreen live services, and our ability to deliver compelling entertainment to hundreds of millions of players around the world. As we make progress around aligning our teams behind our biggest long-term opportunities, we will continue to stay focused, disciplined, and agile to deliver multi-year growth. Now, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andrew.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Stuart. EA is set to launch some of the world\u2019s most anticipated and celebrated games and experiences. At a time when our growing global community are choosing games as their first form of entertainment and primary way to stay connected with friends through shared fandom, the value and opportunity of creating interactive entertainment has never been greater. With our exceptional teams, an unrelenting commitment to execution, our world class IP, and technological advancements that will accelerate and expand our ability to deliver new levels of creativity and innovation, EA is building toward incredible growth in the years to come. Now, Stuart, Laura and I are here for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. When we look at the mobile performance in the quarter, I wanted to get your perspective on where we are in the cycle of recovery in mobile more broadly. Obviously, mobile was an area that struggled as we moved out of the pandemic and dealt with some of the challenges from the IDFA headwinds from Apple's privacy changes. And as we get deeper into 2023 and you think about growth and investing behind mobile into 2024 calendar, just more interested in how your perspectives have changed about mobile as part of the broader mix of the portfolio. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Thanks, Eric. Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll hand-off to Stuart. I think that we have always believe that mobile is an incredibly valuable platform for us, not just in the context of being the world's largest gaming platform and our ability to generate return from blockbuster IP that is mobile native, but also our ability to use mobile as a tool for acquiring new users to our broader ecosystems of play. And you're seeing that happen around what will be FC later this year, what is currently FIFA and what will be FC later in this year. And we're also starting to see that as we build out towards other blockbuster ecosystems around our biggest IP. As I think about the business broadly, we spent a lot of time and a lot of energy over the last 12-months, really rightsizing the cost profile of our mobile business and really driving for great efficiency and higher levels of engagement and monetization across our very broad portfolio. And certainly, through Q1, we're seeing results ahead of our expectations. Our sense is that we will have growth from here, but it is a different mobile market that we're going into. Things do take longer from launch to scale in size. And certainly, we think the biggest opportunities are almost certainly around our big, broad IP-driven ecosystems.\nStuart Canfield: Eric, just to add on a couple of points there on the financial side. Obviously, we talk to in Q1 outside of the Apex headwinds, which will be there for several quarters as we lap the sunset of the title. Obviously, we're up 3% and 5% at constant currency as we saw in the script. I think how do we preface that Q-over-Q, we're seeing, to the point in the script, overperforming expectations on some of our key titles we called out Galaxy of Heroes. We talked to FIFA. We continue to roll out on Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth and expect that to continue to grow through subsequent quarters. We are expecting and have guided to a 1% growth in Q2 as well. So overall, we saw a stabilization in Q4. We saw acceleration in terms of the GAAP Q-over-Q in terms of declines year-over-year, and we feel well-positioned behind the strategy levers that Andrew just laid out.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you so much for the color. And you upfront ran my follow-up on how mobile and traditional play might integrate on a title like EA FC. So thanks so much.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nClay Griffin: Yes. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered if -- Andrew, I appreciate the context in terms of the pipeline. I guess, wanted to get perhaps an update on College Football. There's a lot of things going on in terms of licensing and just wondering if you could just give us a sense of where that title is, I suppose? And then on FIFA, I wanted to ask, the daily active number. Just wanted to get a sense to drill down if you might be able to give us some sense of monetization impacts in the quarter at Ultimate Team. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Great. Let me take the College Football piece, and I'll hand-off to Stuart to think about FIFA in the quarter. The team is making incredible progress around college football. Again, we have a long history and an incredible legacy around building this great game in terms of the context of American football, in addition to our very, very, very famous and culturally relevant Madden franchise. College football has always played a meaningful part in gameplay in this country. The team is doing an incredible job building out what would be the future of college football. Game players really coming together and really capturing all of the action and pageantry and the difference in college football versus the NFL. I feel very confident in what the team is doing. We've certainly -- we're working through the license situation broadly. And as of now, we've got many, if not most, of the schools' license as part of our licensing platform. And we'll continue to work with the various governing bodies of the sport in the country and some key third-party partners that we have around how and when to include college athletes themselves into the game, and we'll work very closely with them. But I'm confident that this will be an incredible reemergence of our college football experience that it will capture all the action and pageantry driven by the schools and all that goes on with the schools and the conduct of this game. And I do believe that we'll find a place where we can work in lockstep with the athletes for inclusion in the game as well.\nStuart Canfield: And Clay, with regards to specifically your question on FIFA, I think I'll just frame up first. I think the second successive record quarter for us with the franchise, the growth was across all platforms. We alluded to mobile net bookings almost doubling Q-over-Q. We saw double-digit growth collectively across all forms, full game through Ultimate Team, Mobile and FO4 for one of our most successful quarters in FIFA.\nClay Griffin: That's great. And just to drill down again. The daily active increases, is that a function of frequency or new player or growth? How should we think about that?\nStuart Canfield: On the daily side, that's really referencing a couple of pieces. One on the mobile side, in particular, as the team have continued to drive reoccurring frequency in content drops. We used to have a much larger spaced-out live service consideration. Now the teams are bringing much greater frequency and therefore greater engagement by virtue, and you're also seeing that evolve itself through the bookings and the overall performance of the mobile SKU.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: One thing I would add there on mobile broadly and on live services broadly is that given that we have this broad portfolio of live services across console, across PC free-to-play, across mobile, we brought in some incredible mobile native talent with our Glu acquisition with Golf Clash. We're starting to really reconcile how to effectively drive these live services at scale. And that includes both how we build core game mechanics, how we build new modalities of play on top of those core game mechanics, how we drive user acquisition, and how we really build modalities of play and live events on a more regular basis to drive extraordinary retention in our franchises. And what you're seeing in our football franchise broadly across console, PC free-to-play and mobile and we're starting to see in the conduct of even the learnings that we've had with Apex coming out of Season 17, and what we're doing in and around mobile, really embedding this great learning that we've had as we brought new talent into the organization. And as we, as an organization, have learned to run these live services at scale, our expectation is this will continue to be a strong tailwind for us as the nature of the industry continues to change, and we operate in this new version of our industry at scale.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Thanks for taking the question. I just have one short-term, one long-term question. On the short-term side, you called out Apex weakness here quite substantially in your prepared remarks, but you kept your full year guide. Is something else kind of making up for it? Or is the weakness just not that bad? But just any comment there on how to reconcile the comments around Apex and the yearly guide.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So first, let me talk about Apex a little bit, and Laura can probably even provide some more detail. Again, this is -- this extraordinary franchise, which has continued to grow and is one of the great franchise in our industry right now, and has its ebbs and flows, and we've seen its ebbs and flows. And again, if I go back to my previous comment, as a company that has been running live services at scale now for nearly two decades, we launched our first live service with FIFA Online back in 2006, we've seen these ebbs and flows in and around our live services. And certainly, we've seen that in the context of Apex. And so we come off a record-level Season 16, the team made some really interesting and creative and innovative changes in 17. That didn't meet our expectations. It's also relevant to note that we went into a very competitive quarter. We -- a few things are happening now. One is the team has worked diligently to make very quick changes and respond to community feedback and community reaction and the performance of Season 17, and we're already starting to see momentum as we go through our current quarter. But this is the nature of our business today is that we will continue to innovate at the very cutting edge of entertainment. Many of those things will work. And by virtue of the collective learning of our organization, we will almost certainly learn faster than others in the industry. But that doesn't mean that there won't be some ebbs and flows. And as we think about the long-term day of the franchise, we factor that in.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. That's helpful.\nLaura Miele: Thank you, Andrew, for the question. Just to add on to what Andrew was saying, I think he covered it well, as far as how we think about live services, experimentation, learning and responding to players. We also -- as we talked about in the opening statement, we have one of the most premier shooter developers in Respawn and in our ability and their strength in optimizing for the shooter audience. That huge strength we have has also provided a pretty significant opportunity for us as we think about new game modes and more accessibility for a broader player base. So think about us being incredibly strong with core shooter players. Again, 18 million active monthly players, over 70% retention, and we have a runway with more players around the world as the team thinks about more accessible modes, bringing in things such as bots to help new player experience and first-time player experiences. So there's a big focus on that. The second area, I would say, on Apex that the team is really focused on is just the geographic expansion. So we've had strong success in North America and Asia, and we were going to continue to evolve our strength there and look at culturalization, marketing areas of focus in other parts of the world to continue our growth. So again, good success and then more to come in that area. And then -- and we have opportunity in the third part of monetization and converting within the game play still. So even though we're 17 seasons in and 4.5 years in, we still see opportunity on monetization in areas such as IP integration, brand partnerships, evolving some of these heirlooms we have for the legends are specific to individual legends and we are looking at creating opportunities for these heirlooms and artifacts to span across all legends to appeal to broader players. So, we see still significant opportunity and growth in the franchise. And I think the team has a really good grasp and have their head around where we're prioritizing and what their focus is.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. That's super helpful. Yes, go ahead.\nStuart Canfield: And Andrew, just to cover for you the financial-specific question upfront as well. And if I back off everything Andrew and Laura just noted, I'm just thinking about, obviously, we entered the year with a more measured approach given the prior Q3 and Q4. We know Q3 is a natural competitive window for us. Inside of how we split the year on H1, obviously, we've got record FIFA performance across the franchise and obviously, mobile is ahead of our expectations. And you should think about Q4 from a seasonality perspective, Apex being one of our stronger quarters as well. So that's how ultimately it balances back in terms of the range on the guide.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just kind of a long-term question maybe for Laura and Stuart. Is -- Andrew did a great job of kind of outlining the pipeline, and I think it's safe to say we're deep enough in a post-COVID world where maybe development is getting back to normal. Where do we stand on that? And as you kind of think about the old, soft guidance, I think, was kind of -- the goal was every year, high single-digit growth, double-digit bottom line growth. Are we getting back to the point where that's going to be normal again? Or is there -- should we expect some still lingering impacts from game delays and COVID and work from home and whatnot? Thank you.\nLaura Miele: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. We just recently reorganized our company into two segments -- into divisions of entertainment and sports, and we think that there is significant growth potential still in both areas. And with a vertical focus in our entertainment business, which I am currently leading, we see significant growth potential in the development of these connected game ecosystems, as Andrew outlined, in action blockbuster titles as we talked about Marvel with our Black Panther and Iron Man and Star Wars games as well. So we see a really strong combination in our strategy around these connected games and these blockbuster action games. And I would say that this is a new evolution of our strategy. So to say that we would go back to development as we once knew it, I think that we are looking forward and continue to reinvent and evolve our development approach and practices based on the opportunity, based on our new strategy, and based on the new structure of our organization.\nStuart Canfield: And Andrew, just to kind of look back on the long-term financial thinking. I think, as you know, obviously, we expensed versus capitalized, and we've been in an investment cycle as we build out the multi-year pipeline that Andrew referenced in his script. I think in terms of, is it going to be sort of normalized, I think we'll continue to map through sort of timing and sequencing for both those releases. You should expect us to start to talk to that towards the back-end of the calendar year early into the next calendar year. And we know we'll give more sort of credence to timing. We want to make sure that we are really clear with our development teams and get into the quarter levels we expect. But you should expect us to get to ultimately with that multi-year pipe sort of more step functional change in the future.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, both.\nKatie Burke: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess starting maybe with Andrew and Laura. Can you talk a little -- in a little more detail about the decision to reorganize the studios into the entertainment and the sports segments and what you'll be able to do differently and better now that you couldn't do before? And then I have one follow-up. Thanks.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. Let me start there, and then Laura can come in and kind of share a little about how she's thinking about the entertainment part of the company. Again, we've had this -- we are in as a company, first and foremost, around our plays. We have over 700 million in our network, and they're spending more and more time with us. And as we think about the future, serving those players in a world where they choose interactive entertainment as their first form of entertainment and they choose the games and experiences that they play as the number one way to connect and stay connected with their friends. And as we think about the future of entertainment, for us, when we drive towards entertaining and engaging that audience of 700 million that we hope grows well beyond 1 billion to 2 billion over the course of time, we wanted to really think about how best to serve those players. And while we're almost absolutely or certainly have crossover between players who play FC and Apex and Need for Speed and Madden, the nature of development and the nature of how those games are built and developed is very different and is getting more different as time passes. And what we wanted to get to as we continue to scale the company, as we continue to scale our franchises and scale the live services that are born from those franchises, get to a place where we were able to empower our creative leaders even more than we have been. We've been on a move over the last five or six years to really give more power to our creative leaders to build and grow and drive their businesses with the direct connection that they have with our players. And we want -- this was the very next evolutionary step in that process and really about giving them more creative autonomy, business autonomy as they are most deeply connected and directly connected to these networks of players and these communities of players that they play with. And it was really about getting to an accelerated level of decision-making and an accelerated level of development. I think we're already starting to see the benefits of that. We've outlined our strategy very clearly. We believe that the future of entertainment is interactive. We believe that any large-scale entertainment company will need to understand and appreciate and be able to develop in the conduct of interactive entertainment for these audiences that are choosing what we do as their first form. And as we think about that building out these platforms that deliver experiences and entertainment that entertain massive online communities, this ability to tell blockbuster interactive stories and its ability to harness the power of these communities not just inside the game, but outside the game, and as we look at what's going on with FC right now, as we think about a reimagined Madden, as we think about the reemergence of college football and all that's happening across our EA SPORTS portfolio, we're seeing accelerated moves towards that. As I think about what's happening in Laura's organization and the speed at which the Respawn team has been able to respond in the context of what's happening in Apex Season 17 as we move towards Apex Season 18, as we think about what's happening for Battlefield and what's happening for The Sims, I'm really excited, because I think we're already seeing the clock speed of our organization increase. And my sense is that will mean that we will build more things, better things, higher-quality things that entertain more people around the world over time.\nLaura Miele: Yes, very well said. And to layer on to what Andrew has outlined is that we are -- think about we are such a talent-centric company. And when you have the incredible talent and development leadership that we do, that we're lucky to have at Electronic Arts, oftentimes, as leaders we evaluate and look at how can we remove barriers, help the speed at which they develop and how they show it for our players. So we are incredibly focused on lifting up and removing friction for our talent so they can show up for our players every day. And we've talked about it a lot on this call about being a live service company and having content and updates in learning and turning and tweaking and using our levers to show up for our players and optimize that. That requires a vertical -- more vertical organization. And it requires as little friction and as much connection to go-to-market ideas, go-to-market strategies, commercial thinking around how we show up for players, as well as the game design, as well as technology. So the more we can integrate that, the faster we can accelerate the potential of our growth. And candidly, the more unleashed and untethered our talent feels, and it's a far more gratifying experience for them, we believe. And I will just tell you, too, on the entertainment side, we were just focused incredibly like lasers on execution. And so we know we have great talent. We know we have these incredible brands in skate, Sims, Apex, Battlefield, Marvel, Star Wars. We know we have the makings of incredible product experiences. Now we have to have heads down, execute, help the teams move as quickly as they can, accelerate that through technology and support and let them run, so we can get to this growth that we know we are capable of in the coming years.\nMatthew Cost: Great. Thank you. And then just quickly on M&A. There was a small mobile gaming M&A deal in the news today, which is the first time that something like that I feel like has come across the radar in a while. Is there more opportunity? Are things -- are conversations maybe restarting in terms of potential acquisitions that have been paused over the past year or two? And do you see opportunity to do more? Or with Glu and Playdemic and Codemasters, you feel like you've kind of brought in what you need to bring in for now?\nAndrew Wilson: I think right now, we feel very good about who we are as a company and the capabilities and talent and teams and IP we have across the organization. And we have a very clear strategy and an even clearer pipeline for growth across IP and across platforms. That being said, I think we're always looking for great opportunities to drive even more growth and entertain even more people through great games and experiences in IP. And we'll continue to work and look at that over the course of time. But it's not something right now that we're actively engaged in.\nMatthew Cost: Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats again to Laura and Stuart. I guess, first, just following up on Apex. Maybe to put a finer point on some of the changes, Andrew and Laura, you talked about with the game. Is the expectation that we'll see in Season 18 some of that improvement in engagement given the game mechanics and the monetization there? And then secondly, just on Star Wars, just kind of curious to learn more about the plan and the expectations as we look to see that extend in terms of the lifetime of the franchise as well as live services. I think more detail there might be useful as well. Thank you.\nLaura Miele: Thanks, Colin. I'll take the Apex question, and then we can talk about the broader Star Wars piece next. On Apex, the way to think about it is when you -- when we have these live services, and I laid out the areas of expansion of new addressable audiences and players, geographic expansion, and then monetization conversion mechanics that will evolve over time, we think about and look at the Apex development cycle and candidly, most live services cycles as short, mid and long-term. So you will see some -- we will see some adjustments and changes in Season 18. And we expect to see even bigger, more impactful changes in 19 and 20 and into the future for the following year. So again, there's a lot the team can do and what they have levers on. And then there are some things, such as modes or changes in mechanics, that just take a longer runway to develop.\nAndrew Wilson: And then on Star Wars, just for my clarity, were you referring to the Star Wars Jedi franchise or Star Wars broadly as we think about the future of the IP and our ability to tell these incredible blockbuster stories in the Galaxy of Star Wars?\nColin Sebastian: Yes, Andrew, I guess, leveraging the strength of the recent Star Wars games, mobile as well as Jedi, and how you foresee that over time, turning into a broader franchise with live services and ongoing engagement.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. We don't have anything to announce today, but we have an incredible partnership with Disney and Lucas. We've had incredible success in that partnership across the Battlefront and the Star Wars Jedi franchise and absolutely with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Our teams are always thinking about what are new experiences that we might be able to create. Certainly, I would love to see more in the Jedi franchise over time. It's just this extraordinary game that tells us extraordinary story. And certainly, again, we may be a little biased, but our sense based on the feedback that we're getting from our community and the quality of that product, it's one of the great beats in the Star Wars Galaxy this year and will likely continue to be a very meaningful part of that Galaxy for many years to come. And certainly, as we bring it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we think there'll be another little bump there for the franchise. And so nothing to announce today other than we have an incredible relationship with Disney. We've had incredible success so far in that partnership. And to the extent that we can find new opportunities to execute against new experiences, including live services as part of that partnership, we will explore them.\nColin Sebastian: Great. Thank you.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I could. I guess, first, anything you can say or talk about just in terms of what the early indicators are telling you around the FC launch. Obviously, I still know we have a lot of the marketing still in front of us. I think the title has a couple more early access days this quarter than it did last year. But just kind of anything that the early indicators are telling you? And then just secondly, as we think about the back half of the year, just curious like any ebbs and flows that you would call out. I think you were really helpful in the prepared comments around FIFA strength and Apex needing some work throughout the year. So I think that's pretty well understood. But you've also called out a bunch of other things, Star Wars Jedi coming to prior-gen consoles. I'm not sure if that's this year or further out. You talked about The Sims parallel experience. I think we've got a FIFA Mobile major update coming later this year. So I guess just outside the frontline release, like any other ebbs and flows that we should be cognizant of for the back half of the year? Thanks, everyone.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes, great question. I would think about this probably in three buckets. The first is the launch went incredibly well. And certainly, that was the first moment we talked about FC. We've been building towards this for some time and working incredibly closely with our partners in a very directly connected way with our global community across console, across PC, across mobile, across geographies. So the launch went incredibly well and was nearly double the positive performance of the launch versus FIFA 23, which in and of itself had achieved some records in terms of its launch awareness and its launch access. So our expectation there is very, very strong that we've hit the right tone. We've built incredible relationships with partners so that we have all of the right license content. Everything we had before, plus more. We've got game teams across console, PC and mobile that are all innovating at the very front-line to make sure that this is not just a change of symbol, but it is, in fact, a symbol of change. And so if I combine what's happening with -- what happened at the launch and the feedback and performance of that with what we're doing in the game, we feel very good about that element. The second element I would point you towards is just the performance of the franchise broadly. We've highlighted this many times before. One of the greatest predictors of future success is both recency and depth of engagement. And on both of those fronts, the existing franchise continues to perform exceptionally well. Again, what we said in the script was it just had its second record quarter in a row. And even as typically you would see that starting to wane as there's not much going on in the world of football right now, at least cup football but for the Women's World Cup, which is doing great things in Australia, New Zealand, we would typically start to see the business wane at this point. And we're not -- we're seeing still really strong engagement and regular engagement from our community. And so that in and of itself is probably one of the greatest predictors of future success. And then third, as we highlighted in the script, we've got a giant marketing budget against this. If you're on mobile or PC free-to-play, you will wake up and your existing experience will now be FC, and you will get all of the new benefits of that. And if you're on console, we're going to be spending a meaningful amount of money. Certainly, more than we ever have done before. We are taking no risk on that front to make sure everybody that loves football in the world understands what FC is, how it applies to them and that it's coming in September. And so net of all of that, I think that if you take into account our launch, plus the quality of the games that we're making across platforms, you take into account the current engagement and recency and regularity of that engagement, and you take into account that we are literally rallying the entire company behind this launch more than we ever have in the 40-years of the company's history around any launch, we feel very good about it.\nStuart Canfield: Matt, just to add on to Andrew. Just a couple of things to think about. I think are important as you think about the financial guidance. Note, obviously, we will have dynamics in timing between Q2, hence the guide, and later in the year, particularly to the investment around FC, obviously, heavily Q2 prelaunch-focused. Also, you should start to think about, to your point on FC, how we nuance the timing and recognition of revenue between Q2 and Q3. Worth noting that the licensing structure will transition back half of the year versus front half of the year. And obviously, we had a heavier launch slate last year in the back half of the year. So we can work through that with you all in the call downs, but just note there's definitely ebbs and flows in timing, and particularly point that to Q2, in particular, as you look at the EPS we put out and how that resonates year-on-year.\nKatie Burke: Operator, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You guys referenced that your margins today are reflective of some investments in long-term projects. And I'm just wondering if you guys could help us a little bit better understand the impact there and maybe what margins might look like in more of a steady state? And then secondly, would you anticipate any changes in consumer spending if student debt payments were to resume at scale? Thanks.\nStuart Canfield: Ben, I'll tackle the second -- maybe the first one. I think, obviously, we're not going to create any guidance or direction on margin structure on a steady state go-forward. I think I'd just point you to the fact that, obviously, we've had depressed margins. We've continued to invest and expensed as we go. We do expect to get back to levels prior to a couple of years ago as we step that margin through. As you think about as we bring some of those titles to bear in the future, both from an owned IP perspective and some of the scale of Battlefield and we think about the business models that will come with other titles around Sims and skate, you should expect that to flow down and be accretive from a margin level as we step through in the future years.\nAndrew Wilson: As I don't know that I can comment specifically on student debt or what might happen there. What I would say is this, though. Entertainment is a fundamental human need, and it has been since the beginning of time. As we look at the emerging generations of consumers, including students, they're choosing interactive entertainment as their first form of entertainment. There's a couple of reasons for that. One, it is way more engaging than maybe what traditional entertainment was. Two, it helps you connect with friends and stay connected with friends. So the nature of the relationships that you build through your consumption of these entertainment properties is significantly more rewarding on a personal basis than watching a movie ever was. And I love movies. But three, the most important thing is it represents the best value entertainment. Even as you think about our incredible scale and the incredible financial performance and growth that we have ahead of us, at an individual consumer level, it still represents the best value entertainment on the planet on a per-hour basis of entertainment. And so I'm not sure what will happen with student debt. But my sense is as we continue to see our industry grow and we continue to see our company grow, as we continue to scale the nature of experiences that we deliver to our consumers and the level of entertainment and connection that provides them, that regardless of what happens in that area, we will continue to be their first choice for entertainment.\nBenjamin Soff: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nKatie Burke: Thank you. And operator, we'll take our last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. Last quarter, it was noted that players were concentrating their spend on major franchises. Just wanted to see first if there was any update to that? And then Andrew, in your commentary, you highlighted a goal for Apex as an experience across platforms. I'm assuming that includes mobile as well. So can you speak to how you envision, potentially relaunching that title on phones and how the approach could differ to the prior game? Thank you.\nAndrew Wilson: Yes. So let me touch on the first part. I do think we continue to see big titles getting bigger and live services getting bigger. And certainly, as a company with a broad portfolio of large-scale IP and large-scale live services, we believe that we will be long-term beneficiaries of that trend. We do -- that doesn't mean that we won't build smaller titles over the course of time. There are these incredible stories that we believe should be told in the context of entertainment. We are focusing our investments so that we can build a cost base around those that's appropriate, but we're also really getting behind our biggest opportunities. And as we've talked about our strategy and building these experiences that entertain massive online communities, our expectation is that will be a large-scale growth driver for us. But, when thought about the right way, games like Dragon Age and Jedi can tell truly blockbuster stories and really break into that top category of games. I think what we see today is the mid-tier and lower games that maybe did pretty well through COVID, because people had a lot of spare time, they're the parts of the industry that really aren't doing and performing as well. And as we think about our future, you should expect we will continue to focus our investments and our energy and our resources against these big opportunities because we do believe that is where the industry is trending.\nLaura Miele: Hi, David, I'll take the Apex mobile question. As Vince and the team evaluate and look at, again, the runway and potential that we have on the franchise beyond the short mid-term that I've outlined today, we see really strong potential in further storytelling, in additional modalities in genre of play. Remember, Apex is set in the Titanfall world. There's a lot of demand and interest in this universe. So as we -- as they evaluate and we look at where the opportunities are, we are looking at new genres, we're looking at potential new platforms, and we are looking at, as I mentioned earlier, the geographic expansion. So nothing to announce today, but all things are not only under consideration, but a meaningful part of our strategy for the future of the brand.\nAndrew Wilson: Okay. Thank you very much for being with us today, and thank you for all of your questions. Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our incredible teams for delivering a record Q1. We look forward to updating you next quarter on November 1 after what I think is going to be our biggest EA Sports season ever, including Madden 24 and of course, our highly anticipated launch of EA SPORTS FC 24. Thank you so much. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Miele",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, for the question. Just to add on to what Andrew was saying, I think he covered it well, as far as how we think about live services, experimentation, learning and responding to players. We also -- as we talked about in the opening statement, we have one of the most premier shooter developers in Respawn and in our ability and their strength in optimizing for the shooter audience. That huge strength we have has also provided a pretty significant opportunity for us as we think about new game modes and more accessibility for a broader player base. So think about us being incredibly strong with core shooter players. Again, 18 million active monthly players, over 70% retention, and we have a runway with more players around the world as the team thinks about more accessible modes, bringing in things such as bots to help new player experience and first-time player experiences. So there's a big focus on that. The second area, I would say, on Apex that the team is really focused on is just the geographic expansion. So we've had strong success in North America and Asia, and we were going to continue to evolve our strength there and look at culturalization, marketing areas of focus in other parts of the world to continue our growth. So again, good success and then more to come in that area. And then -- and we have opportunity in the third part of monetization and converting within the game play still. So even though we're 17 seasons in and 4.5 years in, we still see opportunity on monetization in areas such as IP integration, brand partnerships, evolving some of these heirlooms we have for the legends are specific to individual legends and we are looking at creating opportunities for these heirlooms and artifacts to span across all legends to appeal to broader players. So, we see still significant opportunity and growth in the franchise. And I think the team has a really good grasp and have their head around where we're prioritizing and what their focus is. Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. We just recently reorganized our company into two segments -- into divisions of entertainment and sports, and we think that there is significant growth potential still in both areas. And with a vertical focus in our entertainment business, which I am currently leading, we see significant growth potential in the development of these connected game ecosystems, as Andrew outlined, in action blockbuster titles as we talked about Marvel with our Black Panther and Iron Man and Star Wars games as well. So we see a really strong combination in our strategy around these connected games and these blockbuster action games. And I would say that this is a new evolution of our strategy. So to say that we would go back to development as we once knew it, I think that we are looking forward and continue to reinvent and evolve our development approach and practices based on the opportunity, based on our new strategy, and based on the new structure of our organization. Yes, very well said. And to layer on to what Andrew has outlined is that we are -- think about we are such a talent-centric company. And when you have the incredible talent and development leadership that we do, that we're lucky to have at Electronic Arts, oftentimes, as leaders we evaluate and look at how can we remove barriers, help the speed at which they develop and how they show it for our players. So we are incredibly focused on lifting up and removing friction for our talent so they can show up for our players every day. And we've talked about it a lot on this call about being a live service company and having content and updates in learning and turning and tweaking and using our levers to show up for our players and optimize that. That requires a vertical -- more vertical organization. And it requires as little friction and as much connection to go-to-market ideas, go-to-market strategies, commercial thinking around how we show up for players, as well as the game design, as well as technology. So the more we can integrate that, the faster we can accelerate the potential of our growth. And candidly, the more unleashed and untethered our talent feels, and it's a far more gratifying experience for them, we believe. And I will just tell you, too, on the entertainment side, we were just focused incredibly like lasers on execution. And so we know we have great talent. We know we have these incredible brands in skate, Sims, Apex, Battlefield, Marvel, Star Wars. We know we have the makings of incredible product experiences. Now we have to have heads down, execute, help the teams move as quickly as they can, accelerate that through technology and support and let them run, so we can get to this growth that we know we are capable of in the coming years. Thanks, Colin. I'll take the Apex question, and then we can talk about the broader Star Wars piece next. On Apex, the way to think about it is when you -- when we have these live services, and I laid out the areas of expansion of new addressable audiences and players, geographic expansion, and then monetization conversion mechanics that will evolve over time, we think about and look at the Apex development cycle and candidly, most live services cycles as short, mid and long-term. So you will see some -- we will see some adjustments and changes in Season 18. And we expect to see even bigger, more impactful changes in 19 and 20 and into the future for the following year. So again, there's a lot the team can do and what they have levers on. And then there are some things, such as modes or changes in mechanics, that just take a longer runway to develop. Hi, David, I'll take the Apex mobile question. As Vince and the team evaluate and look at, again, the runway and potential that we have on the franchise beyond the short mid-term that I've outlined today, we see really strong potential in further storytelling, in additional modalities in genre of play.

            "name": "Stuart Canfield",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew, and hello to everyone. I'm honored to be on my first earnings call in my new role as Chief Financial Officer. Throughout my twenty-year career at EA, I have been and continue to be inspired by our talented teams and the entertainment and experiences they create for our players. I am excited by our future, and I have great conviction that our strategy and teams will help us achieve our ambitions to lead the future of entertainment. Turning to our business, we continue to see healthy engagement and new player acquisition across our portfolio and have started the year strong. Today, we are reaffirming our full year net bookings outlook. I'll now speak to our Q1 results. Net bookings were $1.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, or 25% in constant currency, primarily driven by continued strength in EA SPORTS FIFA and the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. This is the second record quarter in a row for EA SPORTS FIFA, with year-over-year growth accelerating from Q4, as this entire franchise continues to demonstrate the strategic potential of a connected massive online community. Our full game net bookings were $401 million, up 143% year-over-year, or 152% in constant currency, primarily driven by the release of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. As Andrew noted, the title was a critical success, with performance in line with our expectations. Based on the strength of the IP, the engaging gameplay, and new ways to bring the title to players, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will continue to deliver long-term value. Our live services were up 4% year over year, or 7% in constant currency. Even in a quarter with such strength in full game, live services, which demonstrates a highly resilient, re-occurring business model, were 75% of total net bookings. With ongoing innovation in EA SPORTS FIFA, Ultimate Team remains a material growth engine for our live services business, with strength across acquisition, engagement, and monetization. In mobile, net bookings were up 3% year over year, or 5% in constant currency, excluding the impact of lapping the sunset of Apex Mobile. We continue to make material progress across our portfolio as we manage our business for long-term profitability. FIFA Mobile delivered record Q1 net bookings, almost doubling from the year prior, driven by historic levels of player engagement and new player acquisition. And although early in our launch, initial metrics are promising for our new title Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth. Apex Legends is a highly successful original IP for EA with a strong community of loyal core players. This quarter, net bookings were below expectations largely driven by underperformance from Season 17. As an evergreen live service that is constantly evolving, our teams continue to innovate on content and introduce new modes of play to engage a broader base of players across different geographies. To echo Andrew, we will continue to invest behind the talented team at Respawn to drive long-term expansion and growth of the franchise. On a GAAP basis, we delivered Q1 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Operating expenses were roughly flat and below our expectations, as we shifted marketing spend for new releases, primarily EA Sports FC, to later in the year. As a result, earnings per share was $1.47, up 32% year-over-year. We delivered operating cash flow of $359 million, one of our largest ever Q1 results, and returned $377 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow is up 2% year-over-year. Now, turning to guidance. Let me start by sharing our assumptions as we think about Q2. First, our guidance assumes continuing momentum in our existing global football business in addition to a strong launch for EA SPORTS FC late in the quarter. Second, we are taking a more measured approach for Apex Legends as the teams apply learnings from Season 17 and introduce new modes of play across various markets. Third, we plan to heavily invest ahead of the launch of the fan platform for the global football community EA SPORTS FC. And finally, as a reminder, net of hedges relative to last year, we continue to expect FX headwinds. As a result of these assumptions, we expect Q2 net bookings of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, down 3% to up 3%, or down 2% to up 4% in constant currency. For the second quarter, we expect GAAP net revenue of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion, and cost of revenue to be $430 million to $450 million. We expect GAAP operating expenses in Q2 to be between $1.11 billion and $1.12 billion, up 9% to 10%, driven by marketing investment noted earlier. And we expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.72 to $0.89. Now, turning to the full-year. We are reaffirming our full-year net bookings guidance range of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion, roughly flat to up 5%, or up 1% to up 6% in constant currency. We are revising our GAAP operating expenses guidance range to $4.25 to $4.37 billion, driven largely by reductions in stock based compensation. As a result, our earnings per share guidance range is now $3.42 to $3.92. We are reaffirming our guidance for our other full-year metrics. We expect operating cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and capital expenditures of around $275 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. To conclude, our strong first quarter is a testament to our incredible brands, our evergreen live services, and our ability to deliver compelling entertainment to hundreds of millions of players around the world. As we make progress around aligning our teams behind our biggest long-term opportunities, we will continue to stay focused, disciplined, and agile to deliver multi-year growth. Now, I'll hand it back to Andrew. Eric, just to add on a couple of points there on the financial side. Obviously, we talk to in Q1 outside of the Apex headwinds, which will be there for several quarters as we lap the sunset of the title. Obviously, we're up 3% and 5% at constant currency as we saw in the script. I think how do we preface that Q-over-Q, we're seeing, to the point in the script, overperforming expectations on some of our key titles we called out Galaxy of Heroes. We talked to FIFA. We continue to roll out on Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth and expect that to continue to grow through subsequent quarters. We are expecting and have guided to a 1% growth in Q2 as well. So overall, we saw a stabilization in Q4. We saw acceleration in terms of the GAAP Q-over-Q in terms of declines year-over-year, and we feel well-positioned behind the strategy levers that Andrew just laid out. And Clay, with regards to specifically your question on FIFA, I think I'll just frame up first. I think the second successive record quarter for us with the franchise, the growth was across all platforms. We alluded to mobile net bookings almost doubling Q-over-Q. We saw double-digit growth collectively across all forms, full game through Ultimate Team, Mobile and FO4 for one of our most successful quarters in FIFA. On the daily side, that's really referencing a couple of pieces. One on the mobile side, in particular, as the team have continued to drive reoccurring frequency in content drops. We used to have a much larger spaced-out live service consideration. Now the teams are bringing much greater frequency and therefore greater engagement by virtue, and you're also seeing that evolve itself through the bookings and the overall performance of the mobile SKU. And Andrew, just to cover for you the financial-specific question upfront as well. And if I back off everything Andrew and Laura just noted, I'm just thinking about, obviously, we entered the year with a more measured approach given the prior Q3 and Q4. We know Q3 is a natural competitive window for us. Inside of how we split the year on H1, obviously, we've got record FIFA performance across the franchise and obviously, mobile is ahead of our expectations. And you should think about Q4 from a seasonality perspective, Apex being one of our stronger quarters as well. So that's how ultimately it balances back in terms of the range on the guide. And Andrew, just to kind of look back on the long-term financial thinking. I think, as you know, obviously, we expensed versus capitalized, and we've been in an investment cycle as we build out the multi-year pipeline that Andrew referenced in his script. I think in terms of, is it going to be sort of normalized, I think we'll continue to map through sort of timing and sequencing for both those releases. You should expect us to start to talk to that towards the back-end of the calendar year early into the next calendar year. And we know we'll give more sort of credence to timing. We want to make sure that we are really clear with our development teams and get into the quarter levels we expect. But you should expect us to get to ultimately with that multi-year pipe sort of more step functional change in the future. Matt, just to add on to Andrew. Just a couple of things to think about. I think are important as you think about the financial guidance. Note, obviously, we will have dynamics in timing between Q2, hence the guide, and later in the year, particularly to the investment around FC, obviously, heavily Q2 prelaunch-focused. Also, you should start to think about, to your point on FC, how we nuance the timing and recognition of revenue between Q2 and Q3. Worth noting that the licensing structure will transition back half of the year versus front half of the year. And obviously, we had a heavier launch slate last year in the back half of the year. So we can work through that with you all in the call downs, but just note there's definitely ebbs and flows in timing, and particularly point that to Q2, in particular, as you look at the EPS we put out and how that resonates year-on-year. Ben, I'll tackle the second -- maybe the first one. I think, obviously, we're not going to create any guidance or direction on margin structure on a steady state go-forward. I think I'd just point you to the fact that, obviously, we've had depressed margins. We've continued to invest and expensed as we go. We do expect to get back to levels prior to a couple of years ago as we step that margin through. As you think about as we bring some of those titles to bear in the future, both from an owned IP perspective and some of the scale of Battlefield and we think about the business models that will come with other titles around Sims and skate, you should expect that to flow down and be accretive from a margin level as we step through in the future years."

I have worked with Stuart for nearly two decades. He has been a trusted partner and valuable leader through many of the biggest transformations at Electronic Arts. I am excited to be working with Stuart as our new Chief Financial Officer, driving multi-year growth and unlocking long-term value. It was a record Q1 for EA with net bookings of $1.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by sustained momentum across the entire EA SPORTS FIFA ecosystem and the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. During the quarter we executed across our business, launching five new high-quality titles, while providing over 145 content updates across 37 titles. Our teams continue to create the entertainment and experiences that inspire, engage, and connect hundreds of millions of players. To every EA employee, for all that you do for our communities, thank you. EA SPORTS FIFA had the biggest Q1 in our company's history. The franchise continues to deliver compelling content to our growing community, driving strong engagement and accelerating net bookings growth. FIFA Ultimate Team engaged tens of millions of fans and daily average users grew 15 %. FIFA Mobile attracted over 65 million new players in the quarter alone. FIFA Online produced double-digit growth across monthly, weekly and daily average users. These remarkable results are a testament to our incredible teams executing against our strategy sharpened by 30-years of passion, innovation, and leadership in interactive football. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is pure blockbuster entertainment, rooted in a timeless, culture-defining IP. Our team at Respawn proudly launched this title to critical acclaim and commercial success. Millions of players have already engaged with the game, making this one of the biggest events in the Star Wars galaxy this year. Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1. Over the coming year, we will harness the community's passion and capitalize on key Star Wars franchise moments to drive continued engagement for this incredible game. Since going free to enter, The Sims 4 community continues to reach a broader global audience, welcoming over 4 million new players in the quarter. In addition to continuing to deliver new content and experiences to expand The Sims 4, the Maxis team is developing a new, innovative parallel experience that will ignite the imaginations of the next generation of players. In Q1, our mobile business delivered ahead of our expectations, driven by outperformance across our broad portfolio, including FIFA Mobile, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and The Sims FreePlay. Over the last year, we focused and refined our approach to mobile. We are excited to see the results as we continue to drive for long-term profitable growth. During the quarter, we launched Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-Earth. Based on strong metrics, the team is tuning and balancing the game to scale user acquisition and promotion in the coming months. Apex Legends is one of the strongest franchises and live services in the industry with 18 million active monthly players and an impressive retention rate of over 70%. After a highly successful 16th season, we launched Season 17 in May with new variations of gameplay and monetization. While this new season did not meet our financial expectations, the team has applied important learnings, including new game mechanics to engage and retain players, which are already generating momentum. We will continue to reinforce the strengths of this franchise by introducing new modes of play and investing in regional marketing, as well as culturalization in key markets. Looking forward, I've never been more excited for what's to come, as we head into the biggest sports season in our company's history. As the world's preeminent interactive American football experience, Madden NFL continues to deliver higher engagement year-over-year, an indicator of future success. This franchise is one of the most powerful IPs in all of sports and is at the center of football culture, bringing the community together in our game and beyond. We are building on a tidal wave of community excitement after the reveal of Josh Allen as Madden NFL 24's cover athlete. This completely new experience will offer more fun, more immersive gameplay, and for the first time ever cross-play to amplify the power of community as we build a connected multi-platform ecosystem around American football. On July 13th, we unveiled our vision for a new era of global football with EA SPORTS FC 24. Alongside this amazing title, we announced advancements of FC Mobile and FC Online in Asia, as well as new experiences FC Tactical mobile and FC Pro esports. This was the biggest reveal we've ever had, generating almost double the positive worldwide response to FIFA 23's debut. Over 2.5 million people have watched the event live and on demand so far, an amazing celebration for the global football community. To secure a fan-first future for FC, we have announced new long-term, global partnerships with UEFA, The Premier League, LaLiga, Frauen-Bundesliga, Liga F, and many more. With these recent announcements, alongside our existing and ongoing network of partnerships, the game will showcase 19,000 fully licensed footballers, 700 squads, 30 leagues, and the biggest competitions. As a result, FC 24 is the most authentic, interactive football experience ever created. It's also a massive leap forward in gameplay innovation with a trio of cutting-edge technologies: Hypermotion V, PlayStyles by Opta and a revolutionized Frostbite engine. The highly anticipated release of FC 24 in September is the first giant step toward realizing a multi-experience global platform capable of connecting over a billion fans. To do more extraordinary things for our people, players and communities, our teams are building the strongest pipeline in the history of EA to drive multi-year growth. Over the next few years, we will launch numerous experiences that grow and deepen the fandom of our legendary IP. Our multi-year targeted investments toward our biggest opportunities include global titles like blockbuster storytelling from Dragon Age, incredible skateboarding gameplay and social connection from skate, and a revival of EA SPORTS College Football that celebrates the action, culture and tradition of the sport like never before. We're also hard at work on a new experience from The Sims that will transform what players can do with creativity, a sprawling action/adventure Iron Man game, a reimagination of Battlefield as a truly connected ecosystem, and the expansion of the Apex Legends universe across platforms, geographies, and modalities of play. The most recent reveal of our Black Panther project set in a massive, explorable universe marks the latest chapter in EA's collaboration with The Walt Disney Company and the Marvel Games team. To drive player engagement and deliver return for our shareholders, we will build unrivaled IPdriven platforms that entertain massive online communities, tell blockbuster stories, and amplify the power of community in and around our games. Being thoughtful and deliberate around feature sets, launch timing, and quality will lead to long-term profitability as we invest in our vision and lead the future of entertainment. Now, I'll hand the call over to Stuart to provide additional details on our business. Thanks, Stuart. EA is set to launch some of the world's most anticipated and celebrated games and experiences. At a time when our growing global community are choosing games as their first form of entertainment and primary way to stay connected with friends through shared fandom, the value and opportunity of creating interactive entertainment has never been greater. With our exceptional teams, an unrelenting commitment to execution, our world class IP, and technological advancements that will accelerate and expand our ability to deliver new levels of creativity and innovation, EA is building toward incredible growth in the years to come. Now, Stuart, Laura and I are here for your questions. Thanks, Eric. Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll hand-off to Stuart. I think that we have always believe that mobile is an incredibly valuable platform for us, not just in the context of being the world's largest gaming platform and our ability to generate return from blockbuster IP that is mobile native, but also our ability to use mobile as a tool for acquiring new users to our broader ecosystems of play. And you're seeing that happen around what will be FC later this year, what is currently FIFA and what will be FC later in this year. And we're also starting to see that as we build out towards other blockbuster ecosystems around our biggest IP. As I think about the business broadly, we spent a lot of time and a lot of energy over the last 12-months, really rightsizing the cost profile of our mobile business and really driving for great efficiency and higher levels of engagement and monetization across our very broad portfolio. And certainly, through Q1, we're seeing results ahead of our expectations. Our sense is that we will have growth from here, but it is a different mobile market that we're going into. Things do take longer from launch to scale in size. And certainly, we think the biggest opportunities are almost certainly around our big, broad IP-driven ecosystems. Okay. Great. Let me take the College Football piece, and I'll hand-off to Stuart to think about FIFA in the quarter. The team is making incredible progress around college football. Again, we have a long history and an incredible legacy around building this great game in terms of the context of American football, in addition to our very, very, very famous and culturally relevant Madden franchise. College football has always played a meaningful part in gameplay in this country. The team is doing an incredible job building out what would be the future of college football. Game players really coming together and really capturing all of the action and pageantry and the difference in college football versus the NFL. I feel very confident in what the team is doing. We've certainly -- we're working through the license situation broadly. And as of now, we've got many, if not most, of the schools' license as part of our licensing platform. And we'll continue to work with the various governing bodies of the sport in the country and some key third-party partners that we have around how and when to include college athletes themselves into the game, and we'll work very closely with them. But I'm confident that this will be an incredible reemergence of our college football experience that it will capture all the action and pageantry driven by the schools and all that goes on with the schools and the conduct of this game. And I do believe that we'll find a place where we can work in lockstep with the athletes for inclusion in the game as well. One thing I would add there on mobile broadly and on live services broadly is that given that we have this broad portfolio of live services across console, across PC free-to-play, across mobile, we brought in some incredible mobile native talent with our Glu acquisition with Golf Clash. We're starting to really reconcile how to effectively drive these live services at scale. And that includes both how we build core game mechanics, how we build new modalities of play on top of those core game mechanics, how we drive user acquisition, and how we really build modalities of play and live events on a more regular basis to drive extraordinary retention in our franchises. And what you're seeing in our football franchise broadly across console, PC free-to-play and mobile and we're starting to see in the conduct of even the learnings that we've had with Apex coming out of Season 17, and what we're doing in and around mobile, really embedding this great learning that we've had as we brought new talent into the organization. And as we, as an organization, have learned to run these live services at scale, our expectation is this will continue to be a strong tailwind for us as the nature of the industry continues to change, and we operate in this new version of our industry at scale. Yes. So first, let me talk about Apex a little bit, and Laura can probably even provide some more detail. Again, this is -- this extraordinary franchise, which has continued to grow and is one of the great franchise in our industry right now, and has its ebbs and flows, and we've seen its ebbs and flows. And again, if I go back to my previous comment, as a company that has been running live services at scale now for nearly two decades, we launched our first live service with FIFA Online back in 2006, we've seen these ebbs and flows in and around our live services. And certainly, we've seen that in the context of Apex. And so we come off a record-level Season 16, the team made some really interesting and creative and innovative changes in 17. That didn't meet our expectations. It's also relevant to note that we went into a very competitive quarter. We -- a few things are happening now. One is the team has worked diligently to make very quick changes and respond to community feedback and community reaction and the performance of Season 17, and we're already starting to see momentum as we go through our current quarter. But this is the nature of our business today is that we will continue to innovate at the very cutting edge of entertainment. Many of those things will work. And by virtue of the collective learning of our organization, we will almost certainly learn faster than others in the industry. But that doesn't mean that there won't be some ebbs and flows. And as we think about the long-term day of the franchise, we factor that in. Yes. Let me start there, and then Laura can come in and kind of share a little about how she's thinking about the entertainment part of the company. Again, we've had this -- we are in as a company, first and foremost, around our plays. We have over 700 million in our network, and they're spending more and more time with us. And as we think about the future, serving those players in a world where they choose interactive entertainment as their first form of entertainment and they choose the games and experiences that they play as the number one way to connect and stay connected with their friends. And as we think about the future of entertainment, for us, when we drive towards entertaining and engaging that audience of 700 million that we hope grows well beyond 1 billion to 2 billion over the course of time, we wanted to really think about how best to serve those players. And while we're almost absolutely or certainly have crossover between players who play FC and Apex and Need for Speed and Madden, the nature of development and the nature of how those games are built and developed is very different and is getting more different as time passes. And what we wanted to get to as we continue to scale the company, as we continue to scale our franchises and scale the live services that are born from those franchises, get to a place where we were able to empower our creative leaders even more than we have been. We've been on a move over the last five or six years to really give more power to our creative leaders to build and grow and drive their businesses with the direct connection that they have with our players. And we want -- this was the very next evolutionary step in that process and really about giving them more creative autonomy, business autonomy as they are most deeply connected and directly connected to these networks of players and these communities of players that they play with. And it was really about getting to an accelerated level of decision-making and an accelerated level of development. I think we're already starting to see the benefits of that. We've outlined our strategy very clearly. We believe that the future of entertainment is interactive. We believe that any large-scale entertainment company will need to understand and appreciate and be able to develop in the conduct of interactive entertainment for these audiences that are choosing what we do as their first form. And as we think about that building out these platforms that deliver experiences and entertainment that entertain massive online communities, this ability to tell blockbuster interactive stories and its ability to harness the power of these communities not just inside the game, but outside the game, and as we look at what's going on with FC right now, as we think about a reimagined Madden, as we think about the reemergence of college football and all that's happening across our EA SPORTS portfolio, we're seeing accelerated moves towards that. As I think about what's happening in Laura's organization and the speed at which the Respawn team has been able to respond in the context of what's happening in Apex Season 17 as we move towards Apex Season 18, as we think about what's happening for Battlefield and what's happening for The Sims, I'm really excited, because I think we're already seeing the clock speed of our organization increase. And my sense is that will mean that we will build more things, better things, higher-quality things that entertain more people around the world over time. I think right now, we feel very good about who we are as a company and the capabilities and talent and teams and IP we have across the organization. And we have a very clear strategy and an even clearer pipeline for growth across IP and across platforms. That being said, I think we're always looking for great opportunities to drive even more growth and entertain even more people through great games and experiences in IP. And we'll continue to work and look at that over the course of time. But it's not something right now that we're actively engaged in. And then on Star Wars, just for my clarity, were you referring to the Star Wars Jedi franchise or Star Wars broadly as we think about the future of the IP and our ability to tell these incredible blockbuster stories in the Galaxy of Star Wars? Yes. We don't have anything to announce today, but we have an incredible partnership with Disney and Lucas. We've had incredible success in that partnership across the Battlefront and the Star Wars Jedi franchise and absolutely with Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Our teams are always thinking about what are new experiences that we might be able to create. Certainly, I would love to see more in the Jedi franchise over time. It's just this extraordinary game that tells us extraordinary story. And certainly, again, we may be a little biased, but our sense based on the feedback that we're getting from our community and the quality of that product, it's one of the great beats in the Star Wars Galaxy this year and will likely continue to be a very meaningful part of that Galaxy for many years to come. And certainly, as we bring it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we think there'll be another little bump there for the franchise. And so nothing to announce today other than we have an incredible relationship with Disney. We've had incredible success so far in that partnership. And to the extent that we can find new opportunities to execute against new experiences, including live services as part of that partnership, we will explore them. Yes, great question. I would think about this probably in three buckets. The first is the launch went incredibly well. And certainly, that was the first moment we talked about FC. We've been building towards this for some time and working incredibly closely with our partners in a very directly connected way with our global community across console, across PC, across mobile, across geographies. So the launch went incredibly well and was nearly double the positive performance of the launch versus FIFA 23, which in and of itself had achieved some records in terms of its launch awareness and its launch access. So our expectation there is very, very strong that we've hit the right tone. We've built incredible relationships with partners so that we have all of the right license content. Everything we had before, plus more. We've got game teams across console, PC and mobile that are all innovating at the very front-line to make sure that this is not just a change of symbol, but it is, in fact, a symbol of change. And so if I combine what's happening with -- what happened at the launch and the feedback and performance of that with what we're doing in the game, we feel very good about that element. The second element I would point you towards is just the performance of the franchise broadly. We've highlighted this many times before. One of the greatest predictors of future success is both recency and depth of engagement. And on both of those fronts, the existing franchise continues to perform exceptionally well. Again, what we said in the script was it just had its second record quarter in a row. And even as typically you would see that starting to wane as there's not much going on in the world of football right now, at least cup football but for the Women's World Cup, which is doing great things in Australia, New Zealand, we would typically start to see the business wane at this point. And we're not -- we're seeing still really strong engagement and regular engagement from our community. And so that in and of itself is probably one of the greatest predictors of future success. And then third, as we highlighted in the script, we've got a giant marketing budget against this. If you're on mobile or PC free-to-play, you will wake up and your existing experience will now be FC, and you will get all of the new benefits of that. And if you're on console, we're going to be spending a meaningful amount of money. Certainly, more than we ever have done before. We are taking no risk on that front to make sure everybody that loves football in the world understands what FC is, how it applies to them and that it's coming in September. And so net of all of that, I think that if you take into account our launch, plus the quality of the games that we're making across platforms, you take into account the current engagement and recency and regularity of that engagement, and you take into account that we are literally rallying the entire company behind this launch more than we ever have in the 40-years of the company's history around any launch, we feel very good about it. As I don't know that I can comment specifically on student debt or what might happen there. What I would say is this, though. Entertainment is a fundamental human need, and it has been since the beginning of time. As we look at the emerging generations of consumers, including students, they're choosing interactive entertainment as their first form of entertainment. There's a couple of reasons for that. One, it is way more engaging than maybe what traditional entertainment was. Two, it helps you connect with friends and stay connected with friends. So the nature of the relationships that you build through your consumption of these entertainment properties is significantly more rewarding on a personal basis than watching a movie ever was. And I love movies. But three, the most important thing is it represents the best value entertainment. Even as you think about our incredible scale and the incredible financial performance and growth that we have ahead of us, at an individual consumer level, it still represents the best value entertainment on the planet on a per-hour basis of entertainment. And so I'm not sure what will happen with student debt. But my sense is as we continue to see our industry grow and we continue to see our company grow, as we continue to scale the nature of experiences that we deliver to our consumers and the level of entertainment and connection that provides them, that regardless of what happens in that area, we will continue to be their first choice for entertainment. Yes. So let me touch on the first part. I do think we continue to see big titles getting bigger and live services getting bigger. And certainly, as a company with a broad portfolio of large-scale IP and large-scale live services, we believe that we will be long-term beneficiaries of that trend. We do -- that doesn't mean that we won't build smaller titles over the course of time. There are these incredible stories that we believe should be told in the context of entertainment. We are focusing our investments so that we can build a cost base around those that's appropriate, but we're also really getting behind our biggest opportunities. And as we've talked about our strategy and building these experiences that entertain massive online communities, our expectation is that will be a large-scale growth driver for us. But, when thought about the right way, games like Dragon Age and Jedi can tell truly blockbuster stories and really break into that top category of games. I think what we see today is the mid-tier and lower games that maybe did pretty well through COVID, because people had a lot of spare time, they're the parts of the industry that really aren't doing and performing as well. And as we think about our future, you should expect we will continue to focus our investments and our energy and our resources against these big opportunities because we do believe that is where the industry is trending. Okay. Thank you very much for being with us today, and thank you for all of your questions. Once again, I want to express my deepest appreciation to our incredible teams for delivering a record Q1. We look forward to updating you next quarter on November 1 after what I think is going to be our biggest EA Sports season ever, including Madden 24 and of course, our highly anticipated launch of EA SPORTS FC 24. Thank you so much. Have a great day."
