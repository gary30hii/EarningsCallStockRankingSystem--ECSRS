I would now like to turn the conference over to James Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.\nJames Zeumer: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning. I'm pleased to welcome you to PulteGroup's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. For the period ended December 31, 2020. We appreciate your time this morning and offer belated best wishes for the new Year. I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance.  A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported fourth quarter numbers as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain reserve adjustments and tax benefits recorded in the period. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financial results is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides.  We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. Also, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.  Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today's call. I hope that your New Year has started well and that you are -- and that you remain healthy and safe. It goes without saying that COVID-19 and the resulting challenges made 2020 a year, unlike any that we've experienced before. Let me just say right up front that I'm extremely proud of how our entire team responded and how our organization remain engaged and focused during some very difficult times.  Thanks to the sustained efforts of our dedicated team, we successfully navigated through a year that started strong, slam to a halt and then accelerated into the strongest demand environment this industry has experienced in more than a decade. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup completed an exceptional year by delivering outstanding fourth quarter results that included a 24% increase in orders, a 220 point increase in gross margin and a 31% increase in adjusted earnings per share. We also ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below 2%.  Reflecting a lot of hard work by an amazing team PulteGroup realized a 6% increase in full year closings to 24,624 homes and a corresponding 7% increase in full year home sale revenues to $10.6 billion. Benefiting from our ability to expand homebuilding gross and operating margins, along with dramatic gains in our financial services business, we converted the 7% top line growth into a 29% increase in pretax income of $1.7 billion. Our outstanding results extend beyond our income statement as we generated $1.8 billion in operating cash flow in 2020, after investing $2.9 billion in land and development during the year.  Beyond investing in land, we increased our dividend by 17%, effective with the payment we made this month and repurchased $171 million of our common shares in 2020, despite having suspended the program for 6 months because of the pandemic. I'm also extraordinarily proud to note that consistent with our focus on generating high returns over the housing cycle we realized a 23.7% return on equity for the year. With 2020 complete, we enter 2021 in a strong financial position and with numerous opportunities to drive further business gains. Obviously, we can't control how the pandemic plays out, but we are optimistic that the multiple vaccines getting distributed mean that we can see a light at the end of this long tunnel.  Bob will provide specific guidance as part of his comments, but let me offer a view of how we are looking at the business and how we plan to operate in the year ahead. We expect a strong demand environment, which the housing industry experienced for much of 2020 and in reality, for many quarters prior to COVID, can continue well into 2021. We said for years that we thought housing starts needed to be around 1.5 million to meet the natural demand created by growth in population and household formations. We finally reached 1.5 million starts in 2020, but we have underbuilt relative to this number for years.  Given this unmet need and the potential mix shift in demand toward more single-family and away from apartment living, we believe demand can remain strong going forward for our business. Beyond the demographic tailwind, we also believe that the pandemic has caused a permanent increase in the number of people who will be working from home full or at least part time. Such a shift has profound implications in terms of what people need from their homes as well as where their homes can be located. For example, we believe a remote working dynamic expands the buyer pool because it can allow people to purchase more affordable homes in further out locations. At the same time, working from home has the potential to increase the intent to buy new homes, which offer floor plans and technology features that better meet the needs of today's homebuyers. With such a strong demand environment, it works to our advantage to be among the nation's largest builders with access to land, labor and material resources.  We enter 2021 with more than 15,000 houses in backlog 180,000 lots under control of which half are controlled via option and long-standing relationships with suppliers and trade partners. The combination of these factors should allow us to increase 2021 deliveries by more than 20% over last year. As we've demonstrated over the years, I am confident in our organization's ability to operate the business successfully and to get homes built. But I do think it's fair to acknowledge that there are points of friction in the system. Labor remains tight, although the change in administration may allow for some relief, assuming immigration policies are eased. At the same time, product manufacturers are battling supply chain issues and the occasional COVID-related disruption within their plants. Although I must say our suppliers have been tremendous partners, going above and beyond in many instances to provide the materials we need.  Given high expectations for the company's operating performance and our balance sheet strain at year-end, I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to execute on all of our capital allocation priorities. More specifically, we are targeting land acquisition and development spend of $3.7 billion in 2021. This is an increase of roughly $800 million over our 2020 investment, but we think appropriate given the growth in our operations. Beyond our expected land investment, we have made great progress in planning for and selecting the location of our next off-site manufacturing plant. We still have a few details to work out with the owners of the sites under consideration but we hope to finalize a plant agreement within the next couple of months and then begin installing the requisite production equipment later this year. Our ICG operation in Jacksonville has exceeded our expectations so we are excited to get this new plant up and running sometime during the first quarter of next year.  Along with investing in the business and continuing to fund our dividend, as you read in this morning's press release, we will be using available cash to pay down $726 million of our outstanding debt in the first quarter. And finally, we will continue to return excess funds to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In response to the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, we had suspended share repurchase activities during the second and third quarters of last year. As detailed in our press release, we resumed the program and repurchased $75 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $171 million. We have repurchased more than 1/3 of the company's shares since initiating the program, and we expect to remain an active buyer of our shares going forward. Housing demand was outstanding in the back half of 2020, with strength across all geographies and buyer segments. And I'm certainly pleased to report that this strength has continued unabated through the first few weeks of January. The housing industry has been extremely fortunate in being an economic engine, but we do not take this for granted, nor will we forget how devastating COVID-19 has been for thousands of businesses and millions of people. It is certainly our hope that we are rapidly approaching the end of this pandemic.  Let me now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my best wishes and express my hope that we can all navigate the coming year in health and safety. As indicated in our press release, our fourth quarter financial results were impacted by the following items: a $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves; a $22 million pretax charge from adjustments to financial services reserves; and a tax benefit of $38 million resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments.  Where appropriate, I'll reference the impact of these items during my review of the quarter. For our fourth quarter, home sale revenues increased 5% over last year to $3.1 billion. The increase in revenues for the period was driven primarily by a 4% increase in average sales price to $446,000 and as closings were up 1% to 6,860 homes. The increase in average sales price for the period reflects a strong pricing environment for all buyer groups. We're pleased to report that on a year-over-year basis, our average sales price was higher for our first time move-up and active adult buyer groups. The demographic mix of our closings moved slightly in the quarter and reflects changes caused both by the pandemic and by our strategic investment to serve more first-time buyers.  Consistent with these dynamics, our fourth quarter closings in 2020 consisted of 32% first time, 46% move up and 22% active adult. In the fourth quarter of 2019, closings were comprised of 31% first time, 45% move up and 24% active adult. Our net new orders for the fourth quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,056 homes, while our average community count for the period was down 2% from last year to 846. The decrease in community count reflects the slowing of our land activities earlier this year in response to the pandemic as well as the faster close out of communities due to the strong demand environment and related elevated absorption paces. Demand was strong across the entire period and actually accelerated toward quarter end as December orders were higher than November and essentially flat with October.  Given the strength of ongoing demand, our divisions are taking specific actions, manage sales pace and production, so our backlog does not get overextended. We are also being thoughtful about adjusting price to help cover rising house costs especially the cost of lumber, which moved significantly higher in the quarter. Consistent with what we experienced during the third quarter, demand was strong across all of our brands, including the ongoing acceleration in demand among active adult buyers. In the fourth quarter, first time orders increased 27% to 2,084 homes, move up orders increased 17% to 2,994 homes, while active adult orders increased 33% and to 1,978 homes.  In fact, our Q4 active adult orders were less than 100 units below the all-time quarterly high we reported in the third quarter of this year. After a pause in the first half of 2020, active adult buyers have clearly gotten off the fence. Our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 12%, which is down from 14% last year. Based on the strength of our sales, our year-end backlog increased 44% over last year to 15,158 homes. Backlog value at year-end was $6.8 billion compared with $4.5 billion last year. We believe our large backlog and continued strong demand for new homes has the company extremely well positioned to realize significant year-over-year growth in closings in 2021. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had a total of 12,370 homes under construction, of which 1,949 or 16% were spec. In the fourth quarter, we focused on closing sold inventory, but we're actively working to increase production of sold and spec homes throughout our markets. Our large backlog makes this process a little easier, and we're working closely with our trades and product suppliers to ensure the needed capacity to deliver more homes going forward. With 12,000 -- 12,370 homes under construction at year-end, we expect deliveries in the first quarter of 2021 to be between 6,300 and 6,600 homes. At the midpoint, this would be a 20% increase in closings over last year.  This growth rate is in line with what we expect for the full year as we are targeting deliveries to increase approximately 22% to 30,000 homes for all of 2021. Given the strength of our move-up in active adult sales, along with price increases realized across all buyer groups, our average sales price in backlog was up 4% over last year to $448,000. Based on the prices and backlog, we expect our average sales price on closings to be in the range of $430,000 to $435,000, both for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. As we've said in the past, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we deliver in any given quarter. Reflecting the benefits of the favorable pricing environment and our ongoing work to run a more efficient homebuilding operation, our fourth quarter gross margin of 25% was up 220 basis points over last year and 50 basis points from the third quarter of this year.  Driven primarily by increases in lumber and labor, our house costs will be higher in 2021. However, given strong demand conditions, we expect to pass-through most of these costs through increased sales prices. As a result, we expect gross margins to remain high and be approximately 24.5% for both the first quarter and the full year. Our reported SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $280 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. Excluding the $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Last year, our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense was $262 million or 8.9% of home sale revenues, excluding an insurance reserve adjustment of $31 million last year, our adjusted SG&A expense was $293 million or 10% of home sale revenues. At the outside of the pandemic, we took action to adjust our overheads in anticipation of a more difficult operating environment. Although nearly all furloughed employees have rejoined the company, and we have hired back many of the employees we released, we still expect to realize improved overhead leverage in 2021. At present, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter of 2021 to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9%, which is down from 11.9% last year.  For the full year, we are targeting an SG&A expense of 10% of home sale revenues, down from 10.2% on an adjusted basis last year. Our financial services operations continued to deliver strong results as we reported fourth quarter pretax income of $43 million, which is up from $34 million last year. It's worth noting that our fourth quarter 2020 results include the $22 million pretax charge from adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves as we settled claims tied to mortgages issued prior to the housing collapse. The increase in pretax income in the quarter from our financial services business reflects continued favorable rate and competitive market conditions, along with higher loan volumes resulting from an increase in mortgage capture rate. Our mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 86%, up from 84% last year. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $86 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 16.4%, and which reflects the tax benefit of $38 million, resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period.  In 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5%, including the benefit of energy tax credits we expect to realize this year. Finishing out my review of the income statement, we reported net income for the fourth quarter of $438 million or $1.62 per share. Our adjusted net income for the period was $404 million or $1.49 per share. In the comparable prior year period, the company reported net income of $336 million or $1.22 per share and adjusted net income of $312 million or $1.14 per share. Benefiting from the outstanding financial performance and resulting cash flows generated by our homebuilding and financial services operations, we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash. In addition, at the end of the year, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29.5%, which is down from 33.6% last year, and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 1.8%.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million common shares at a cost of $75 million or an average price of $43.69 per share. For the full year, the company returned $171 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.5 million common shares at a cost of $37.58 per share. As noted in our earnings release, we expect to pay down $726 million of our outstanding senior notes in 2 separate transactions during the first quarter of this year. First, we'll exercise the early redemption feature effective February 1 on $426 million of senior notes originally scheduled to mature on March 1 this year. In addition, we initiated a tender offer this morning for $300 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes, which we expect to complete on February 26.  Assuming full execution of the tender, the retirement of the $726 million will save the company approximately $34 million in annual interest charges and on a pro forma basis, lower our gross debt-to-capital ratio to 23.7%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $942 million in land acquisition and development which brings our full year 2020 spend to $2.9 billion. As Ryan mentioned, given our positive view of the market and the expected strong cash flow generation of the business, we currently expect to increase our investment in land acquisition and development to $3.7 billion in 2021.  And finally, we ended the year with slightly more than 180,000 lots under control, of which 91,000 were owned and 89,000 were controlled through options. I want to highlight that based on these numbers, we've effectively reached our stated goals of having 50% of our land pipeline controlled through options. And given our guidance targeting 30,000 closings '21 we've also reached our goal of having 3 years of owned lots. Land acquisition can be lumpy, so the numbers could move around, but we remain disciplined in our investment practices and focused on enhancing returns and reducing risks through the use of options.  Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. When I took over as CEO in 2016, there were several areas where I saw an opportunity to enhance our long-term business performance. Among the targets we put in place were to expand first time to be 1/3 of our business, to lower our lot position to 3 years of owned lots, to control 50% of our land pipeline via option, and increase our growth rates while continuing to deliver high returns for our shareholders.  Given our 2020 performance and our expectations for 2021, it is gratifying to say that we've achieved these initial goals with this foundational work in place, we can now continue developing an even more successful business as we expand our operations, advancing innovative customer-centric technologies and integrate new construction processes. Our outstanding 2020 results in combination with continued strength in housing demand, also has PulteGroup entering '21 with tremendous momentum. We begin the year with our largest backlog in well over a decade, along with great operating metrics and a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities. These opportunities include the expansion of our off-site manufacturing capabilities that I spoke about earlier as well as the geographic expansion of our homebuilding operations. I'm sure that most of you saw last week's press release that PulteGroup has established new operations in the Greater Denver area. At the same time, our Raleigh division is extending its reach and establishing a presence in the TRID area of North Carolina, which includes the cities of Greensboro, Winston Salem and Burlington. We have our initial land positions in place, and we're working quickly to increase our lot pipeline in these new areas.  We are excited about the opportunities we see in both markets as well as several other cities we are currently evaluating. With our goal to increase closings by more than 20% this year, along with investing $3.7 billion in land and our expansion into new markets, we believe we are well positioned to grow our operations while continuing to deliver high returns.  In closing, I'm extremely proud of what our organization accomplished in 2020. The and I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts toward delivering an outstanding homebuying experience and homes of exceptional quality. I also want to thank our suppliers and trade who are working tirelessly to provide the resources needed to successfully run our business. We entered 2021 with high expectations, but I know the pandemic continues to rage and so we will continue to operate our business thoughtfully and safely.  Let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call to questions. So we can get as many questions completed as possible during the remaining time of this call. [Operator Instructions]. And now let me ask Andrew to again explain the process and open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: Nice results. Brian or Bob, I guess first question really is around land investment and in away capital allocation as well. Not to turn our nose up at an $800 million increase in land spend this year, it does seem like you guys are maintaining your typical balance when you're thinking about the debt paydown, the potential for share repurchases. A lot of your peers have started to more significantly ramp up land investment, just given the strength in demand and potentially some shortfalls in community counts coming. How do you think about this current environment and your allocation to land investment relative to your more balanced kind of through-cycle mentality?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. A couple of things that I would share with you. Number one, I would orient you to the fact that we've maintained for the better part of the decade that we're running a balanced business through cycle, where we want to invest in land, first and foremost, and grow our business, but there are other parts of capital allocation that we believe create long-term value. We are taking a pretty big step-up in our land spend this year, as I think we've highlighted this morning, going to $3.7 million. It's a big bump from where we were at in 2020. Certainly, there were some delays in '20 that have rolled into '21. But even adjusting for that, we think it's a pretty big step-up. We are going to continue to be very thoughtful and responsible in making sure that we're driving the types of returns that we know create long-term value. We just don't believe that now is the appropriate time to get into -- back into the mentality where all available cash is funneled into land.  The last thing, Mike, I'd tell you is that we do -- while we don't peg our land investment specific to this number, we do think about land spend as a percentage of revenue. And we think the numbers that we have allocated and projected for 2021 are an appropriate step up, reflective of what is a very strong market.\nMichael Dahl: Okay. My second question goes to the margin side, and you clearly had success in terms of utilizing price and controlling costs to drive margin expansion. I think you alluded to margins potentially being slightly lower than the 4Q levels and mostly being able to offset the increase in-house costs. Could you just elaborate more on kind of magnitude of the increase in costs, maybe on a per square foot basis or however you want to quantify that, that you're expecting to come through the P&L?  And also, if you could share some sort of kind of price per square foot that you've been able to achieve, just help us understand that balance between price cost a little bit better?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, it's Bob. I think important to remember, we're starting from a very strong margin position and certainly, in the fourth quarter, we got the benefit of some spec sales, and we don't have a ton of spec on the ground today. So as we're looking forward into the year, what we're trying to project is where are the sales prices that we've contracted. But we recognize that our house costs are going up. We are projecting them to be up in the neighborhood of 5% next year in fiscal '21. So that's inclusive of commodity input cost and labor. So a little bit richer increase than we've seen for the past couple of years. Obviously, the market is strong. We think we can get most of that price back. The other thing we are cautious of is affordability, and we want to make sure that we've got pricing that people can actually afford to close on. So our teams are doing a nice job of managing that price equation as we're out in market. So the guide for the year at 24.5% again, reflective of a very, very strong environment. And -- but we do recognize, especially with lumber, having risen so rapidly that there'll be a little bit of pressure on margins with that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.\nIvy Zelman: And congrats on a strong year in the fourth quarter. Maybe, Ryan, you can help us better understand when you think about the $3.7 billion of acquisition land acquisition development, spend, even excluding COVID, we hear a lot from municipality or builders complaining, we want affordable housing, just not in our backyard. And just thinking about some of the constraints on getting lots developed is there anything that can change with maybe whether it's some type of tax incentive to developers? There's a lot of focus on the demand side by the Biden administration. But do you think that it's not a constraint that appears to be and you're overcoming that? Or is there something that has to change to continue to build more shelter for this country with municipalities being a bottleneck?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Ivy, and thanks for the question. I think you've touched on an item that, frankly, we've been talking about as an industry and as a company for a while, and you hit the nail on the head. I think all municipalities want more affordable housing and shelter as they work to grow their job base and grow their own local municipalities and economies. But you nailed that they want it as long as it's not next door or 2 existing residents or other folks that are already there. So I believe that's more a local issue than it is a national issue and -- but that being said, I do think a tone from the top, from the administration can certainly help to influence what local municipalities do.  So look, there are challenges out there, but one of the things that I think we highlighted is our size. And I think the talented team that we have, we're working through what is a challenging environment out there, and we are able to get our land entitled. We are able to get it developed, we are able to get investment. If things were a little easier, I think you could do even more. But we feel very comfortable about the numbers that we've put forward for 2021.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Bouley of Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: I wanted to follow-up on the margin side. So guiding gross margins up 20 basis points in '21 despite this pricing environment. I'm just wondering if there's any, I guess, other margin headwinds that we should be aware of beyond that increase in-house cost, you just mentioned, Bob. So I'm thinking whether it's the mix of option lands that's come up and maybe now coming through? Or perhaps more first time closings expected? Just what else might be sort of playing into the puts and takes there on that guide?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Matt, I don't think there's anything really dramatic. Obviously, land is more expensive, each successive lot as the vintage gets kind of worked through, you're bringing more expensive land on as the market has appreciated through the years. So that's a contributor. Other than that, I mean, we've got a very large backlog. We've got pretty good visibility into what our margins are going to be. And in candor, we contracted these houses 3 months ago and so the pricing environment isn't fully reflected in our sales right now. So you see that kind of on a little bit of a lag with us. We actually like that because it puts us in a position where we can understand our house cost going into it when we're contracting. But we do have a little bit of a lag in terms of where the pricing environment is right now versus what is closing for us, for instance, in the first quarter.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay. Understood. That's helpful. Second one, just around selling pace. I think I heard you say that December ended up even stronger than November. And correct me if I misheard you, of course. But just obviously, Pulte, like many others, ending the year running faster than usual. Last quarter, you guys talked about sort of intentional slowing of pace. Do you think you have the capacity at this point to see further uptick on selling pace into Q1 as normal? And I guess, I think you mentioned January sort of continued unabated. I guess any additional color there would be helpful as well.\nRyan Marshall: Matt, it's Ryan. We did have a very strong fourth quarter. And you heard correctly, December sign-ups were up over November and equal to what we did in October. And I think for those of you that have been following the industry for as long as you have, that's atypical. Normally, you see a seasonally downturn October to November, November to December. So I think it's reflective of how strong the demand is. And then January is off to a very good start. So we did, in the majority of our divisions manage the number of sales that we were allowing to be sold either via lot releases or price increases or some combination of both. And that's really about making sure that we're matching our sales rate to our ability to produce homes.  We've significantly increased the production capacity that we have. So I think we're doing a nice job working through that. And then the other factor that you've got to think about is lot availability. So we factor all of those things into our sales release and our pricing strategy. And all of those elements are reflected in the guide that we've given for the full year. So it's -- look, as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, it's a great time to be in the homebuilding business. And I think there are a number of really strong demographic and economic trends that are going to continue to help support this industry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Yes. Good quarter. I was really intrigued by some of the things that give a glimpse into what could be coming. One of the interesting things, I think that you pointed out is that you have a build-to-order model, which suggests that what we saw in the fourth quarter doesn't really fully reflect the environment, which it sounds like it was pretty enormously strong in the fourth quarter. So it looks like that's still yet to come. And so in that vein, I wanted to ask you about your outlook for pricing and, therefore, implicitly margins. We couldn't help but notice that your order price this quarter was extremely strong. And relative to the price that you are forecasting or your outlook for price for the full year next year. I just did a quick analysis of that going back through time. And we have never seen anything like the kind of decline that you're calling for in your full year '21 closing price relative to the order price that you took this quarter.  And in your commentary, everything seemed to suggest that there is actual momentum building in price. And so I just wanted to talk to you about what is embedded in that? Is there a significant mix shift of more entry-level communities that you are embedding in that assumption? And are you not seeing what other builders seem to be seeing, which is consumers actually paying up for more options and upgrades, which your BPO model would capture and even a preference for larger homes. Because your guidance would seem to suggest that's not happening nearly to the degree that you're going to have a negative mix shift. It's kind of curious. So I was wondering if you could address that.\nRyan Marshall: Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. There was a lot in there to unpack, and I'll try and touch on the key elements. And if I miss anything, we'll come back and grab it in a follow-up. But we are seeing a robust pricing environment, as I think we've highlighted, as it relates to the pricing, the ASP guidance that we've given for the full year, it is being largely influenced by the increasing amount of first-time business that we have coming through our business, along with geographic mix. So as you know, we build in kind of coastal locations like Northern California, Southern California, et cetera. And so the load of closings that come out of those divisions relative to other places in the country can certainly have an influence on ASP.  As it relates to pricing and our ability to take price I think, Stephen, you know that we've long talked about our strategic pricing methodology and how that has been a large contributor of the company's outperformance in margin relative to the competition. So certainly, we feel that will continue to be a real strength for the company. We're operating in the same market that I think everyone else is and so there's not really any reason to believe that we wouldn't benefit from the uptake in demand and the ability to push price.\nStephen Kim: Yes. I certainly would agree with that. It's just that maybe we haven't seen it as quickly in your numbers just because you have a build-to-order model, but that should also allow you to capture, I would think, if anything, a little bit more price. Because you give your comes the ability to option. In that regard, we've seen a couple of other builders report so far that our spec builders and in both cases, we -- well, so far, we've seen margins for the spec builders surprise to the upside even versus what they had thought a couple of months ago. And when we dig into that, some of it, obviously, is pricing, but some of it is also that cost per square foot seems like it didn't go up as much as they might have thought. And part of the reason for that is because they found that they're building somewhat larger homes.  And that the somewhat larger homes have an actual lower cost per square foot because there's only 1 kitchen and only 1 roof and all that kind of stuff. So you get more efficiency when you build a slightly larger box. I was curious if you're seeing any of that and if you have incorporated any of that into your thinking about what cost per square foot will be over the next 6 to 12 months?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen. So we've certainly factored into the guide that we've given what we believe the product mix will be. But within a given community, the offering that you could have -- could easily range from -- just as an example, 2,000 feet to 3,300 feet. Within that, there might be 4 or 5 floor plans, and you don't know what plan the customer is going to choose until they come into the sales office. So we have made some assumptions. I think as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're seeing customers do different things based on their current their current living situation, their work from home situation, the need for more space, more space for school, more space for home gyms, et cetera.  So there's -- I think there certainly is a story to be told that there are some bigger homes being built. To your point, I'd agree with you, bigger homes are a little bit more efficient. So time will tell. We've factored in what we think are our best assumptions at this point in time, and we'll continue to keep everyone updated as the year progresses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rehaut of Jpmorgan.\nMichael Rehaut: And congrats on the results. I wanted to circle back to gross margins, and I apologize that this is beating a dead horse a little bit. But just wanted to try to get a better sense of the levers here. And you hit on price. But when you look at the 25% margin in the fourth quarter, it was up a little bit versus the guidance of 24.5%. And now you're also looking for 24.5% in the first quarter and -- of '21 and the full year of '21. So I was just curious, number one, what drove that differential? And if it was more temporary or mix driven per se? And number two, when you think about price versus cost inflation, I think a lot of builders have been looking towards some decent level of gross margin expansion in '21 versus '20. Given your margins being so much higher historically over the last few years than most of the other builders, I'm wondering if there's any upward limitations on taking price from an affordability perspective or a competitive perspective, if that's why perhaps we're not seeing as much expansion in '21 versus '20, just given the higher starting point?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I think it's apples-to-oranges to a certain degree, in terms of us versus others. So I can't comment on their relative margin performance. And Mike, there's clearly nothing that prevents us from accelerating price if it's available in the market. And if that's expansive to margin, we're going to do it. I think we've demonstrated, and you saw it actually in fiscal '20 versus the prior year, we were up that 25% was up 220 basis points over the prior year. So we're paying attention to market, and we're looking to get every dollar of price that we can.  I think in terms of the forward guide, we've got 15,000-plus homes in backlog, right? We kind of have pretty good visibility into what our margin profile is going to look like next year. There is nothing, and I want to be clear about this, nothing that will stop us from trying to expand that margin. But based on what we see today, we want to give you the best estimate we've got. And as I said in answer to an earlier question, we do see vertical construction costs escalating. Lumber, I think everybody is aware of. It's a busy market out there. There's a lot of people selling a lot of houses. We think there'll be some price on the labor side that we'll be asked to contribute for that.  So at the end of the day, we are pretty -- we're pleased with our margin profile. We'll seek to try and push it to the extent that we can get more price going forward. And if that more than covers the increase in costs, including land, I think you can see us do that. And there's no message here, but we outperformed in this most recent quarter. If the opportunity is there, we'll seek to do the same going forward.\nRyan Marshall: And Mike, on the Q4 outperformance, I just -- you asked where did that come from, we mixed in more spec inventory in Q4 than we had anticipated. And so there's a good example of we were able to get kind of current market pricing that help provide some outperformance in Q4.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks for that, Ryan and Bob, that was very helpful. I guess, secondly, I just wanted to focus a little bit on community count and sales pace. And your community count in the second quarter, just down a touch year-over-year. Which was relatively positive, I think, versus some of your peers having much greater declines. At the same time, you've made comments, I believe, around -- and correct me if I'm wrong here. But to a degree, perhaps managing sales pace to make sure you're not getting too far ahead of your backlog and allowing your business to operate at a relatively consistent cadence. How should we think about '21 on those metrics?  And specifically, community count, if you could give any directional guidance for the first quarter and where we should expect year-end to wind up. And to the extent that you've kind of limited or managed your sales pace, could we expect sales pace in '21 to be more kind of consistent even off of these levels?  Obviously, again, you're not seeing in your numbers, maybe the dramatic year-over-year growth on some of your peers. And I'm just wondering if that could actually work towards your benefit as you get through the next few quarters?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. So I think the question sort of is what's the community count for next year? And how are we thinking about sales against that? And the way I think we ask you to think about community count, we obviously had a slowdown in development spend this year, even some delayed AC. We've highlighted that we're going to be investing at a more aggressive rate next year, Ryan walked through that. Where we see it is community count in Q1 of '21 versus Q1 of '20 is down about 5%. And then if you fast forward to your question at the end of the year where do we think we'll be? We'll be down about 5% kind of end of year '21 versus end of year '20 will have some variability in that during the year, and it will be dependent on what's the sales environment like? How quickly are we closing out of communities? And what's the weather like, how does development go?  We'll obviously be looking to accelerate communities as much as we can. But the sales environment is going to drive some of that number too. And we are looking at a pretty big step-up in acquisition spend next year, which would obviously contribute to years beyond that.\nOperator: The next question with apologies to Ms. Zelman, a follow-up or second question for her from Zelman & Associates.\nRyan Marshall: Maybe I thought we hit I scared you away with my last answer.\nIvy Zelman: Yes. No, a follow-up.\nRyan Marshall: It was Zeumer's fault, right?\nIvy Zelman: Yes, Zeumer, right. It was Zeumer's fault, there you go. Just digging in a little bit on the land spend. You think about spending $3.7 billion. Are you spending -- are you fully set up for '22? Or are you still buying for '22? And how far out are you buying? And just give us just the perspective between the margin differential on the option lot versus on the own lot? If there is a differential from a price perspective and margin perspective?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Ivy, both good questions. We're pretty well set up for most of '22 at this point. Some of the spend that will happen in '21 will influence the back half of '22, but we're mostly set up. So given the difficulties that you highlighted in your first question with entitlements and approvals and things like that, we're largely into 2023 at this point in time. And we've factored that into kind of everything that we're doing. In terms of -- and the second part of your question, I lost my train of thought on that one.\nIvy Zelman: The option -- the option margin or price differential?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So Ivy -- the thing I or --\nIvy Zelman: I know you focus on returns, and I recognize that. And I see it a faster return, we'd be the option or a better return. But just thinking about the pricing in the market, the land grab right now is pretty heated. So what are you seeing if there's a differential when you're optioning lots and what that may be from an impact to gross margin, even if it's a better return?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So I don't want this to come across as the nonanswer, Ivy, but you highlighted the most important point, which is we underwrite the return every single deal we do has got very different characteristics depending on who the seller is. As a general rule of thumb though, there is a cost to doing options. They're not free. And we factor that into what the ultimate return is and the overall kind of risk reward balance that we think we're getting for the option. So Bob, anything else you'd highlight on that.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: The 1 thing I'd add is that in terms of the optionality, there's a couple of ways that, that manifests self, right? Are you doing a finished lot option transaction or are you tying up a bigger parcel where you're saying, all right, I want 1/3 of the lots today, 1/3 of lot 2 or 3 years from now and 1/3 of lots, 2 or 3 years after that. Remember, we're trying to manage against market risk as much as anything else. And so I don't think that the kind of the step-up is as impactful on margin because of that as opposed to just doing a straight finished lot option deal. So if you're in a master plan because they're getting real-time retail pricing for taking all that risk for you to take just-in-time lot delivery.  So I don't know -- if you look at the book, a lot of our transactions are more what I've described as having these are larger lot positions that's just more than we need right now. And so we're paying a little bit for people to carry the land but then we might even be developing the land. It might not even be an option of finished lots. So I don't think it's a deleterious from a margin perspective as some people think sometimes when they're looking at it is exactly the way you just did.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc.\nKenneth Zener: To make sure I was connected. Great quarter. I mean, your leverage is flat. Your returns on capital, or as I look at our returns on inventory, are very high. So you should be investing in your company like you're doing. So I have 2 questions. First, go over your logic for this 50% owned option target and how much does del web legacy land play into that? And then my second question, is you're a build-to-order builder, yet your start capacity is limiting your orders. Perhaps. So what does that mean for your kind of start capacity? I mean, you started about 7,500 homes. We can calculate your starts basically. So what is your 30,000 guidance reflect in terms of where your quarterly capacity is going?\nRyan Marshall: Ken, so I'll maybe take the start capacity question first. And we feel good about how our production machine is running. We have ramped it up almost every single quarter, and we continue to do so. And that's the guide that we've given for full year deliveries are reflective of the pace that we believe our production capacity is on certainly, if we can do more, we'll work to do that, and we think the demand environment is there that would allow us. But there's a lot of moving parts in that, labor capacity, supplier capacity, et cetera.  So in addition to that, Ken, and I think everybody knows, we've long believed that the build-to-order model is better for a number of reasons, and it's the 1 that we've chosen to largely employ but specs are a big part of kind of what we do as well, especially with our entry level, lower priced product. And so in addition to building our sold not started backlog, we're also in increasing the number of specs that we have in the system. I don't believe that the build-to-order model is limiting our ability for success because at some point in time, you've got to make a decision about how much you can build. Whether you build that as a sold or you build that as a spec, you still got -- you've got to put the start on the ground at some point in time. So we're in a great time right now. We're excited about the prospects for 2021. And if we can keep some of the wins at our sales here, I think we're going to have a great year.  Andrew, are you still there? Who is next in the queue?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: The . Is 9:30. Could they have timed it.\nRyan Marshall: Andrew? [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. Jim, I got a confirmation from a couple of folks that the audience can still hear. So it sounds like it's an operator challenge.\nJames Zeumer: So if anybody wants to -- we're still here. So if anybody wants to text me a call or text me a question, we'll do our best to take it that way because I'm not sure where our operator disappear to. I'm not sure at this point in time in terms of technical difficulty, how we're going to solve this. But again, we'll give it another couple of minutes if anybody wants to e-mail me a question or text me a question, I'm happy -- we're happy to answer it. And I apologize for this confusion.\nOperator: I guess it's just a are this is the conference operator. It looks like we're experiencing some technical difficulties. I'm going to go ahead and take over the call for now. It seems we were in the middle of our Q&A session. Is that correct?\nRyan Marshall: That's correct.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG.\nJohn Micenko: It's always Zeumer's fault, isn't it?\nRyan Marshall: Jack, I think this one, we can actually let Zeumer off the hook. I'm not sure he had anything to do with this.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: He was running around with wire cutters, but I don't know what that so now your next in the Q? Jack?\nJohn Micenko: Probably, probably. All right. So we got a huge backlog. You've got great visibility into it. The industry has seen backlog conversion rate come down, not surprisingly coming out of some of the unique things we dealt with in 2020. It looks like the 1Q guide is calling for continued pressure on backlog conversion historically, which tells me there's a ramp in the back half of this year to hit that 20% growth. Can we unpack some of the drivers that I think Bob talked about increasing spec in the prepared commentary but kind of what gives you confidence you can sort of build back some of that backlog conversion in the back half of the year while maintaining margin?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Jack, it's Ryan. We tend to look at our conversion of work and process inventory as opposed to backlog. So we do have a larger backlog than we ordinarily carry, which is reflective of the strong sales environment. From a production standpoint, we're running very comparable to what we've historically run in terms of work and process conversion. And what I can tell you without giving you specific numbers is the daily, weekly, monthly start rates are increasing, working through that sold not started backlog and the spec inventory such that we feel like the guide that we've given for the full year is very achievable.  So it's not necessarily a huge bet on a bunch of incremental spec inventory, which I think you may have been alluding to a little bit. Certainly, we want to put more in there, but it's really reflective of getting through the sold not started backlog in addition to putting some more spec in the ground. Our cycle times are a little elongated, given some of the disruptions in the supply chain. I think the areas where there's some -- a little bit of sand in the gears from a product standpoint or probably fairly widely known. I'd highlight that the relationships we have, the size of our company, the talented procurement team that we have. We've done a really nice job working through that, but it is a challenge that is out there for sure.\nJohn Micenko: And then you've got you've got the 1 plant down in Jacksonville. You're bringing another 1 online, I think early online early '22, right? How should we think of -- where will that show up in the numbers? Is that going to be at a company level, is that going to be gross margin? Is it going to be G&A ratio? Maybe lower warranty reserves over time. Where can guys like outside looking and kind of expect to see the benefit of that in the model?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Jack, I'll let Bob take that one. And maybe what I'll do is I'll highlight the benefits that we think we're going to get out of these plants. And the reason that we bought the first one, the reason that we're expanding to the second one, we're getting huge increases in our cycle time efficiency, which is a big deal and the labor efficiencies that we're picking up are tremendous as well. You combine those things with the added cost benefits that we're getting, and we're very pleased with how these off-site manufacturing facilities are performing. So as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, Jacksonville's exceeded our expectations. We're on the plant number two. We're in the final stages of site selection and just working through some contract things. So we're excited about the prospect of what the future of this holds, and then I'll let Bob touch on where you can see the numbers.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Jack, it's in homebuilding. Obviously. And so you'll see, I think, a couple of impacts. One is the contribution from the business itself. It's on the margin line, it's consistent with not a little bit better than our building our homebuilding operation. And then you obviously have the benefit, we believe, in terms of both the cycle time that Ryan talked about. But even some cost benefit to the builder side of the business, so the actual divisions contracting with them. And then there is a cost to do in this, but it's not out of line with the rest of our business. So I think it -- for all intents and purposes, you won't see it impact things materially other than that we get the improved operations that Ryan was talking about.\nJames Zeumer: Operator, I think we have time for 1 more call, if you're still there. One more question if you're still there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: My first question is really around the active adult business. You saw another nice lift there. Quarter. I think, Ryan, in your comments, you kind of mentioned the fact that it feels like that buyer is definitely out there. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in terms of the demand trends there? How you're thinking about that coming through? And how much of this do you think is really being driven by the fact that maybe the existing market in some areas in the country, like maybe the Northeast and other parts that weren't as strong prior to COVID have really kind of picked up and allow these people to kind of get out of their homes and make that transition?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Susan, and take the question. I think there's a number of things that are benefiting the active adult buyer right now. One is they were first to kind of go to the sidelines they've certainly got more comfortable figuring out how to buy and figuring out how to make the decisions that they want to make as it relates to the retirement. The strong stock market behavior, I think, certainly plays a factor in that as retirement accounts are our flush. And then finally, the strong resale market has made it a seller's market, and so very easy for that active adult buyer to sell their existing home and move into 1 of our new communities. So our expectation is that the Webb brand will continue to be a big part of our business, and that buyer will continue to perform very well.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. And my follow-up question is around capital allocation. You started to buy back some stock in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit to how you're thinking about that for '21? And any kind of color you can give there?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Susan, the stance that we've taken on stock buybacks is that we'll report the news. What we have highlighted is it is going to continue to be part of our capital allocation. We paused for the second and the third quarter given the pandemic. But as you saw in the fourth quarter, we reinitiated a $75 million level. So we will be active throughout 2021. We're not going to provide forward guidance on the amount of the spend rather at the end of each quarter, we'll share with you what we've done.\nJames Zeumer: I think we've now kind of run out of time, and I apologize for the technical difficulties for it. We'll certainly look forward to getting back to everybody over the course of the day. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my best wishes and express my hope that we can all navigate the coming year in health and safety. As indicated in our press release, our fourth quarter financial results were impacted by the following items: a $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves; a $22 million pretax charge from adjustments to financial services reserves; and a tax benefit of $38 million resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments.  Where appropriate, I'll reference the impact of these items during my review of the quarter. For our fourth quarter, home sale revenues increased 5% over last year to $3.1 billion. The increase in revenues for the period was driven primarily by a 4% increase in average sales price to $446,000 and as closings were up 1% to 6,860 homes. The increase in average sales price for the period reflects a strong pricing environment for all buyer groups. We're pleased to report that on a year-over-year basis, our average sales price was higher for our first time move-up and active adult buyer groups. The demographic mix of our closings moved slightly in the quarter and reflects changes caused both by the pandemic and by our strategic investment to serve more first-time buyers.  Consistent with these dynamics, our fourth quarter closings in 2020 consisted of 32% first time, 46% move up and 22% active adult. In the fourth quarter of 2019, closings were comprised of 31% first time, 45% move up and 24% active adult. Our net new orders for the fourth quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,056 homes, while our average community count for the period was down 2% from last year to 846. The decrease in community count reflects the slowing of our land activities earlier this year in response to the pandemic as well as the faster close out of communities due to the strong demand environment and related elevated absorption paces. Demand was strong across the entire period and actually accelerated toward quarter end as December orders were higher than November and essentially flat with October.  Given the strength of ongoing demand, our divisions are taking specific actions, manage sales pace and production, so our backlog does not get overextended. We are also being thoughtful about adjusting price to help cover rising house costs especially the cost of lumber, which moved significantly higher in the quarter. Consistent with what we experienced during the third quarter, demand was strong across all of our brands, including the ongoing acceleration in demand among active adult buyers. In the fourth quarter, first time orders increased 27% to 2,084 homes, move up orders increased 17% to 2,994 homes, while active adult orders increased 33% and to 1,978 homes.  In fact, our Q4 active adult orders were less than 100 units below the all-time quarterly high we reported in the third quarter of this year. After a pause in the first half of 2020, active adult buyers have clearly gotten off the fence. Our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 12%, which is down from 14% last year. Based on the strength of our sales, our year-end backlog increased 44% over last year to 15,158 homes. Backlog value at year-end was $6.8 billion compared with $4.5 billion last year. We believe our large backlog and continued strong demand for new homes has the company extremely well positioned to realize significant year-over-year growth in closings in 2021. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had a total of 12,370 homes under construction, of which 1,949 or 16% were spec. In the fourth quarter, we focused on closing sold inventory, but we're actively working to increase production of sold and spec homes throughout our markets. Our large backlog makes this process a little easier, and we're working closely with our trades and product suppliers to ensure the needed capacity to deliver more homes going forward. With 12,000 -- 12,370 homes under construction at year-end, we expect deliveries in the first quarter of 2021 to be between 6,300 and 6,600 homes. At the midpoint, this would be a 20% increase in closings over last year.  This growth rate is in line with what we expect for the full year as we are targeting deliveries to increase approximately 22% to 30,000 homes for all of 2021. Given the strength of our move-up in active adult sales, along with price increases realized across all buyer groups, our average sales price in backlog was up 4% over last year to $448,000. Based on the prices and backlog, we expect our average sales price on closings to be in the range of $430,000 to $435,000, both for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. As we've said in the past, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we deliver in any given quarter. Reflecting the benefits of the favorable pricing environment and our ongoing work to run a more efficient homebuilding operation, our fourth quarter gross margin of 25% was up 220 basis points over last year and 50 basis points from the third quarter of this year.  Driven primarily by increases in lumber and labor, our house costs will be higher in 2021. However, given strong demand conditions, we expect to pass-through most of these costs through increased sales prices. As a result, we expect gross margins to remain high and be approximately 24.5% for both the first quarter and the full year. Our reported SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $280 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. Excluding the $16 million net pretax benefit from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues.  Last year, our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense was $262 million or 8.9% of home sale revenues, excluding an insurance reserve adjustment of $31 million last year, our adjusted SG&A expense was $293 million or 10% of home sale revenues. At the outside of the pandemic, we took action to adjust our overheads in anticipation of a more difficult operating environment. Although nearly all furloughed employees have rejoined the company, and we have hired back many of the employees we released, we still expect to realize improved overhead leverage in 2021. At present, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter of 2021 to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9%, which is down from 11.9% last year.  For the full year, we are targeting an SG&A expense of 10% of home sale revenues, down from 10.2% on an adjusted basis last year. Our financial services operations continued to deliver strong results as we reported fourth quarter pretax income of $43 million, which is up from $34 million last year. It's worth noting that our fourth quarter 2020 results include the $22 million pretax charge from adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves as we settled claims tied to mortgages issued prior to the housing collapse. The increase in pretax income in the quarter from our financial services business reflects continued favorable rate and competitive market conditions, along with higher loan volumes resulting from an increase in mortgage capture rate. Our mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 86%, up from 84% last year. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $86 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 16.4%, and which reflects the tax benefit of $38 million, resulting from energy tax credits and deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period.  In 2021, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5%, including the benefit of energy tax credits we expect to realize this year. Finishing out my review of the income statement, we reported net income for the fourth quarter of $438 million or $1.62 per share. Our adjusted net income for the period was $404 million or $1.49 per share. In the comparable prior year period, the company reported net income of $336 million or $1.22 per share and adjusted net income of $312 million or $1.14 per share. Benefiting from the outstanding financial performance and resulting cash flows generated by our homebuilding and financial services operations, we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash. In addition, at the end of the year, our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 29.5%, which is down from 33.6% last year, and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 1.8%.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million common shares at a cost of $75 million or an average price of $43.69 per share. For the full year, the company returned $171 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.5 million common shares at a cost of $37.58 per share. As noted in our earnings release, we expect to pay down $726 million of our outstanding senior notes in 2 separate transactions during the first quarter of this year. First, we'll exercise the early redemption feature effective February 1 on $426 million of senior notes originally scheduled to mature on March 1 this year. In addition, we initiated a tender offer this morning for $300 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes, which we expect to complete on February 26.  Assuming full execution of the tender, the retirement of the $726 million will save the company approximately $34 million in annual interest charges and on a pro forma basis, lower our gross debt-to-capital ratio to 23.7%. In the fourth quarter, we invested $942 million in land acquisition and development which brings our full year 2020 spend to $2.9 billion. As Ryan mentioned, given our positive view of the market and the expected strong cash flow generation of the business, we currently expect to increase our investment in land acquisition and development to $3.7 billion in 2021.  And finally, we ended the year with slightly more than 180,000 lots under control, of which 91,000 were owned and 89,000 were controlled through options. I want to highlight that based on these numbers, we've effectively reached our stated goals of having 50% of our land pipeline controlled through options. And given our guidance targeting 30,000 closings '21 we've also reached our goal of having 3 years of owned lots. Land acquisition can be lumpy, so the numbers could move around, but we remain disciplined in our investment practices and focused on enhancing returns and reducing risks through the use of options.  Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yes, Mike, it's Bob. I think important to remember, we're starting from a very strong margin position and certainly, in the fourth quarter, we got the benefit of some spec sales, and we don't have a ton of spec on the ground today. So as we're looking forward into the year, what we're trying to project is where are the sales prices that we've contracted. But we recognize that our house costs are going up. We are projecting them to be up in the neighborhood of 5% next year in fiscal '21. So that's inclusive of commodity input cost and labor. So a little bit richer increase than we've seen for the past couple of years. Obviously, the market is strong. We think we can get most of that price back. The other thing we are cautious of is affordability, and we want to make sure that we've got pricing that people can actually afford to close on. So our teams are doing a nice job of managing that price equation as we're out in market. So the guide for the year at 24.5% again, reflective of a very, very strong environment. And -- but we do recognize, especially with lumber, having risen so rapidly that there'll be a little bit of pressure on margins with that. Yes, Matt, I don't think there's anything really dramatic. Obviously, land is more expensive, each successive lot as the vintage gets kind of worked through, you're bringing more expensive land on as the market has appreciated through the years. So that's a contributor. Other than that, I mean, we've got a very large backlog. We've got pretty good visibility into what our margins are going to be. And in candor, we contracted these houses 3 months ago and so the pricing environment isn't fully reflected in our sales right now. So you see that kind of on a little bit of a lag with us. We actually like that because it puts us in a position where we can understand our house cost going into it when we're contracting. But we do have a little bit of a lag in terms of where the pricing environment is right now versus what is closing for us, for instance, in the first quarter. Yes. I think it's apples-to-oranges to a certain degree, in terms of us versus others. So I can't comment on their relative margin performance. And Mike, there's clearly nothing that prevents us from accelerating price if it's available in the market. And if that's expansive to margin, we're going to do it. I think we've demonstrated, and you saw it actually in fiscal '20 versus the prior year, we were up that 25% was up 220 basis points over the prior year. So we're paying attention to market, and we're looking to get every dollar of price that we can.  I think in terms of the forward guide, we've got 15,000-plus homes in backlog, right? We kind of have pretty good visibility into what our margin profile is going to look like next year. There is nothing, and I want to be clear about this, nothing that will stop us from trying to expand that margin. But based on what we see today, we want to give you the best estimate we've got. And as I said in answer to an earlier question, we do see vertical construction costs escalating. Lumber, I think everybody is aware of. It's a busy market out there. There's a lot of people selling a lot of houses. We think there'll be some price on the labor side that we'll be asked to contribute for that.  So at the end of the day, we are pretty -- we're pleased with our margin profile. We'll seek to try and push it to the extent that we can get more price going forward. And if that more than covers the increase in costs, including land, I think you can see us do that. And there's no message here, but we outperformed in this most recent quarter. If the opportunity is there, we'll seek to do the same going forward. Yes. So I think the question sort of is what's the community count for next year? And how are we thinking about sales against that? And the way I think we ask you to think about community count, we obviously had a slowdown in development spend this year, even some delayed AC. We've highlighted that we're going to be investing at a more aggressive rate next year, Ryan walked through that. Where we see it is community count in Q1 of '21 versus Q1 of '20 is down about 5%. And then if you fast forward to your question at the end of the year where do we think we'll be? We'll be down about 5% kind of end of year '21 versus end of year '20 will have some variability in that during the year, and it will be dependent on what's the sales environment like? How quickly are we closing out of communities? And what's the weather like, how does development go?  We'll obviously be looking to accelerate communities as much as we can. But the sales environment is going to drive some of that number too. And we are looking at a pretty big step-up in acquisition spend next year, which would obviously contribute to years beyond that. The 1 thing I'd add is that in terms of the optionality, there's a couple of ways that, that manifests self, right? Are you doing a finished lot option transaction or are you tying up a bigger parcel where you're saying, all right, I want 1/3 of the lots today, 1/3 of lot 2 or 3 years from now and 1/3 of lots, 2 or 3 years after that. Remember, we're trying to manage against market risk as much as anything else. And so I don't think that the kind of the step-up is as impactful on margin because of that as opposed to just doing a straight finished lot option deal. So if you're in a master plan because they're getting real-time retail pricing for taking all that risk for you to take just-in-time lot delivery.  So I don't know -- if you look at the book, a lot of our transactions are more what I've described as having these are larger lot positions that's just more than we need right now. And so we're paying a little bit for people to carry the land but then we might even be developing the land. It might not even be an option of finished lots. So I don't think it's a deleterious from a margin perspective as some people think sometimes when they're looking at it is exactly the way you just did. The . Is 9:30. Could they have timed it. He was running around with wire cutters, but I don't know what that so now your next in the Q? Jack? Yes, Jack, it's in homebuilding. Obviously. And so you'll see, I think, a couple of impacts. One is the contribution from the business itself. It's on the margin line, it's consistent with not a little bit better than our building our homebuilding operation. And then you obviously have the benefit, we believe, in terms of both the cycle time that Ryan talked about. But even some cost benefit to the builder side of the business, so the actual divisions contracting with them. And then there is a cost to do in this, but it's not out of line with the rest of our business. So I think it -- for all intents and purposes, you won't see it impact things materially other than that we get the improved operations that Ryan was talking about."

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today's call. I hope that your New Year has started well and that you are -- and that you remain healthy and safe. It goes without saying that COVID-19 and the resulting challenges made 2020 a year, unlike any that we've experienced before. Let me just say right up front that I'm extremely proud of how our entire team responded and how our organization remain engaged and focused during some very difficult times.  Thanks to the sustained efforts of our dedicated team, we successfully navigated through a year that started strong, slam to a halt and then accelerated into the strongest demand environment this industry has experienced in more than a decade. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup completed an exceptional year by delivering outstanding fourth quarter results that included a 24% increase in orders, a 220 point increase in gross margin and a 31% increase in adjusted earnings per share. We also ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below 2%.  Reflecting a lot of hard work by an amazing team PulteGroup realized a 6% increase in full year closings to 24,624 homes and a corresponding 7% increase in full year home sale revenues to $10.6 billion. Benefiting from our ability to expand homebuilding gross and operating margins, along with dramatic gains in our financial services business, we converted the 7% top line growth into a 29% increase in pretax income of $1.7 billion. Our outstanding results extend beyond our income statement as we generated $1.8 billion in operating cash flow in 2020, after investing $2.9 billion in land and development during the year.  Beyond investing in land, we increased our dividend by 17%, effective with the payment we made this month and repurchased $171 million of our common shares in 2020, despite having suspended the program for 6 months because of the pandemic. I'm also extraordinarily proud to note that consistent with our focus on generating high returns over the housing cycle we realized a 23.7% return on equity for the year. With 2020 complete, we enter 2021 in a strong financial position and with numerous opportunities to drive further business gains. Obviously, we can't control how the pandemic plays out, but we are optimistic that the multiple vaccines getting distributed mean that we can see a light at the end of this long tunnel.  Bob will provide specific guidance as part of his comments, but let me offer a view of how we are looking at the business and how we plan to operate in the year ahead. We expect a strong demand environment, which the housing industry experienced for much of 2020 and in reality, for many quarters prior to COVID, can continue well into 2021. We said for years that we thought housing starts needed to be around 1.5 million to meet the natural demand created by growth in population and household formations. We finally reached 1.5 million starts in 2020, but we have underbuilt relative to this number for years.  Given this unmet need and the potential mix shift in demand toward more single-family and away from apartment living, we believe demand can remain strong going forward for our business. Beyond the demographic tailwind, we also believe that the pandemic has caused a permanent increase in the number of people who will be working from home full or at least part time. Such a shift has profound implications in terms of what people need from their homes as well as where their homes can be located. For example, we believe a remote working dynamic expands the buyer pool because it can allow people to purchase more affordable homes in further out locations. At the same time, working from home has the potential to increase the intent to buy new homes, which offer floor plans and technology features that better meet the needs of today's homebuyers. With such a strong demand environment, it works to our advantage to be among the nation's largest builders with access to land, labor and material resources.  We enter 2021 with more than 15,000 houses in backlog 180,000 lots under control of which half are controlled via option and long-standing relationships with suppliers and trade partners. The combination of these factors should allow us to increase 2021 deliveries by more than 20% over last year. As we've demonstrated over the years, I am confident in our organization's ability to operate the business successfully and to get homes built. But I do think it's fair to acknowledge that there are points of friction in the system. Labor remains tight, although the change in administration may allow for some relief, assuming immigration policies are eased. At the same time, product manufacturers are battling supply chain issues and the occasional COVID-related disruption within their plants. Although I must say our suppliers have been tremendous partners, going above and beyond in many instances to provide the materials we need.  Given high expectations for the company's operating performance and our balance sheet strain at year-end, I believe we are exceptionally well positioned to execute on all of our capital allocation priorities. More specifically, we are targeting land acquisition and development spend of $3.7 billion in 2021. This is an increase of roughly $800 million over our 2020 investment, but we think appropriate given the growth in our operations. Beyond our expected land investment, we have made great progress in planning for and selecting the location of our next off-site manufacturing plant. We still have a few details to work out with the owners of the sites under consideration but we hope to finalize a plant agreement within the next couple of months and then begin installing the requisite production equipment later this year. Our ICG operation in Jacksonville has exceeded our expectations so we are excited to get this new plant up and running sometime during the first quarter of next year.  Along with investing in the business and continuing to fund our dividend, as you read in this morning's press release, we will be using available cash to pay down $726 million of our outstanding debt in the first quarter. And finally, we will continue to return excess funds to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In response to the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, we had suspended share repurchase activities during the second and third quarters of last year. As detailed in our press release, we resumed the program and repurchased $75 million of stock in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $171 million. We have repurchased more than 1/3 of the company's shares since initiating the program, and we expect to remain an active buyer of our shares going forward. Housing demand was outstanding in the back half of 2020, with strength across all geographies and buyer segments. And I'm certainly pleased to report that this strength has continued unabated through the first few weeks of January. The housing industry has been extremely fortunate in being an economic engine, but we do not take this for granted, nor will we forget how devastating COVID-19 has been for thousands of businesses and millions of people. It is certainly our hope that we are rapidly approaching the end of this pandemic.  Let me now turn the call over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. When I took over as CEO in 2016, there were several areas where I saw an opportunity to enhance our long-term business performance. Among the targets we put in place were to expand first time to be 1/3 of our business, to lower our lot position to 3 years of owned lots, to control 50% of our land pipeline via option, and increase our growth rates while continuing to deliver high returns for our shareholders.  Given our 2020 performance and our expectations for 2021, it is gratifying to say that we've achieved these initial goals with this foundational work in place, we can now continue developing an even more successful business as we expand our operations, advancing innovative customer-centric technologies and integrate new construction processes. Our outstanding 2020 results in combination with continued strength in housing demand, also has PulteGroup entering '21 with tremendous momentum. We begin the year with our largest backlog in well over a decade, along with great operating metrics and a strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities. These opportunities include the expansion of our off-site manufacturing capabilities that I spoke about earlier as well as the geographic expansion of our homebuilding operations. I'm sure that most of you saw last week's press release that PulteGroup has established new operations in the Greater Denver area. At the same time, our Raleigh division is extending its reach and establishing a presence in the TRID area of North Carolina, which includes the cities of Greensboro, Winston Salem and Burlington. We have our initial land positions in place, and we're working quickly to increase our lot pipeline in these new areas.  We are excited about the opportunities we see in both markets as well as several other cities we are currently evaluating. With our goal to increase closings by more than 20% this year, along with investing $3.7 billion in land and our expansion into new markets, we believe we are well positioned to grow our operations while continuing to deliver high returns.  In closing, I'm extremely proud of what our organization accomplished in 2020. The and I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts toward delivering an outstanding homebuying experience and homes of exceptional quality. I also want to thank our suppliers and trade who are working tirelessly to provide the resources needed to successfully run our business. We entered 2021 with high expectations, but I know the pandemic continues to rage and so we will continue to operate our business thoughtfully and safely.  Let me turn the call back to Jim. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. A couple of things that I would share with you. Number one, I would orient you to the fact that we've maintained for the better part of the decade that we're running a balanced business through cycle, where we want to invest in land, first and foremost, and grow our business, but there are other parts of capital allocation that we believe create long-term value. We are taking a pretty big step-up in our land spend this year, as I think we've highlighted this morning, going to $3.7 million. It's a big bump from where we were at in 2020. Certainly, there were some delays in '20 that have rolled into '21. But even adjusting for that, we think it's a pretty big step-up. We are going to continue to be very thoughtful and responsible in making sure that we're driving the types of returns that we know create long-term value. We just don't believe that now is the appropriate time to get into -- back into the mentality where all available cash is funneled into land.  The last thing, Mike, I'd tell you is that we do -- while we don't peg our land investment specific to this number, we do think about land spend as a percentage of revenue. And we think the numbers that we have allocated and projected for 2021 are an appropriate step up, reflective of what is a very strong market. Yes, Ivy, and thanks for the question. I think you've touched on an item that, frankly, we've been talking about as an industry and as a company for a while, and you hit the nail on the head. I think all municipalities want more affordable housing and shelter as they work to grow their job base and grow their own local municipalities and economies. But you nailed that they want it as long as it's not next door or 2 existing residents or other folks that are already there. So I believe that's more a local issue than it is a national issue and -- but that being said, I do think a tone from the top, from the administration can certainly help to influence what local municipalities do.  So look, there are challenges out there, but one of the things that I think we highlighted is our size. And I think the talented team that we have, we're working through what is a challenging environment out there, and we are able to get our land entitled. We are able to get it developed, we are able to get investment. If things were a little easier, I think you could do even more. But we feel very comfortable about the numbers that we've put forward for 2021. Matt, it's Ryan. We did have a very strong fourth quarter. And you heard correctly, December sign-ups were up over November and equal to what we did in October. And I think for those of you that have been following the industry for as long as you have, that's atypical. Normally, you see a seasonally downturn October to November, November to December. So I think it's reflective of how strong the demand is. And then January is off to a very good start. So we did, in the majority of our divisions manage the number of sales that we were allowing to be sold either via lot releases or price increases or some combination of both. And that's really about making sure that we're matching our sales rate to our ability to produce homes.  We've significantly increased the production capacity that we have. So I think we're doing a nice job working through that. And then the other factor that you've got to think about is lot availability. So we factor all of those things into our sales release and our pricing strategy. And all of those elements are reflected in the guide that we've given for the full year. So it's -- look, as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, it's a great time to be in the homebuilding business. And I think there are a number of really strong demographic and economic trends that are going to continue to help support this industry. Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. There was a lot in there to unpack, and I'll try and touch on the key elements. And if I miss anything, we'll come back and grab it in a follow-up. But we are seeing a robust pricing environment, as I think we've highlighted, as it relates to the pricing, the ASP guidance that we've given for the full year, it is being largely influenced by the increasing amount of first-time business that we have coming through our business, along with geographic mix. So as you know, we build in kind of coastal locations like Northern California, Southern California, et cetera. And so the load of closings that come out of those divisions relative to other places in the country can certainly have an influence on ASP.  As it relates to pricing and our ability to take price I think, Stephen, you know that we've long talked about our strategic pricing methodology and how that has been a large contributor of the company's outperformance in margin relative to the competition. So certainly, we feel that will continue to be a real strength for the company. We're operating in the same market that I think everyone else is and so there's not really any reason to believe that we wouldn't benefit from the uptake in demand and the ability to push price. Yes, Stephen. So we've certainly factored into the guide that we've given what we believe the product mix will be. But within a given community, the offering that you could have -- could easily range from -- just as an example, 2,000 feet to 3,300 feet. Within that, there might be 4 or 5 floor plans, and you don't know what plan the customer is going to choose until they come into the sales office. So we have made some assumptions. I think as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're seeing customers do different things based on their current their current living situation, their work from home situation, the need for more space, more space for school, more space for home gyms, et cetera.  So there's -- I think there certainly is a story to be told that there are some bigger homes being built. To your point, I'd agree with you, bigger homes are a little bit more efficient. So time will tell. We've factored in what we think are our best assumptions at this point in time, and we'll continue to keep everyone updated as the year progresses. And Mike, on the Q4 outperformance, I just -- you asked where did that come from, we mixed in more spec inventory in Q4 than we had anticipated. And so there's a good example of we were able to get kind of current market pricing that help provide some outperformance in Q4. Maybe I thought we hit I scared you away with my last answer. It was Zeumer's fault, right? Yes, Ivy, both good questions. We're pretty well set up for most of '22 at this point. Some of the spend that will happen in '21 will influence the back half of '22, but we're mostly set up. So given the difficulties that you highlighted in your first question with entitlements and approvals and things like that, we're largely into 2023 at this point in time. And we've factored that into kind of everything that we're doing. In terms of -- and the second part of your question, I lost my train of thought on that one. Yes. So Ivy -- the thing I or -- Yes. So I don't want this to come across as the nonanswer, Ivy, but you highlighted the most important point, which is we underwrite the return every single deal we do has got very different characteristics depending on who the seller is. As a general rule of thumb though, there is a cost to doing options. They're not free. And we factor that into what the ultimate return is and the overall kind of risk reward balance that we think we're getting for the option. So Bob, anything else you'd highlight on that. Ken, so I'll maybe take the start capacity question first. And we feel good about how our production machine is running. We have ramped it up almost every single quarter, and we continue to do so. And that's the guide that we've given for full year deliveries are reflective of the pace that we believe our production capacity is on certainly, if we can do more, we'll work to do that, and we think the demand environment is there that would allow us. But there's a lot of moving parts in that, labor capacity, supplier capacity, et cetera.  So in addition to that, Ken, and I think everybody knows, we've long believed that the build-to-order model is better for a number of reasons, and it's the 1 that we've chosen to largely employ but specs are a big part of kind of what we do as well, especially with our entry level, lower priced product. And so in addition to building our sold not started backlog, we're also in increasing the number of specs that we have in the system. I don't believe that the build-to-order model is limiting our ability for success because at some point in time, you've got to make a decision about how much you can build. Whether you build that as a sold or you build that as a spec, you still got -- you've got to put the start on the ground at some point in time. So we're in a great time right now. We're excited about the prospects for 2021. And if we can keep some of the wins at our sales here, I think we're going to have a great year.  Andrew, are you still there? Who is next in the queue? Andrew? [Technical Difficulty]. Yes. Jim, I got a confirmation from a couple of folks that the audience can still hear. So it sounds like it's an operator challenge. That's correct. Jack, I think this one, we can actually let Zeumer off the hook. I'm not sure he had anything to do with this. Yes, Jack, it's Ryan. We tend to look at our conversion of work and process inventory as opposed to backlog. So we do have a larger backlog than we ordinarily carry, which is reflective of the strong sales environment. From a production standpoint, we're running very comparable to what we've historically run in terms of work and process conversion. And what I can tell you without giving you specific numbers is the daily, weekly, monthly start rates are increasing, working through that sold not started backlog and the spec inventory such that we feel like the guide that we've given for the full year is very achievable.  So it's not necessarily a huge bet on a bunch of incremental spec inventory, which I think you may have been alluding to a little bit. Certainly, we want to put more in there, but it's really reflective of getting through the sold not started backlog in addition to putting some more spec in the ground. Our cycle times are a little elongated, given some of the disruptions in the supply chain. I think the areas where there's some -- a little bit of sand in the gears from a product standpoint or probably fairly widely known. I'd highlight that the relationships we have, the size of our company, the talented procurement team that we have. We've done a really nice job working through that, but it is a challenge that is out there for sure. Yes. Jack, I'll let Bob take that one. And maybe what I'll do is I'll highlight the benefits that we think we're going to get out of these plants. And the reason that we bought the first one, the reason that we're expanding to the second one, we're getting huge increases in our cycle time efficiency, which is a big deal and the labor efficiencies that we're picking up are tremendous as well. You combine those things with the added cost benefits that we're getting, and we're very pleased with how these off-site manufacturing facilities are performing. So as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, Jacksonville's exceeded our expectations. We're on the plant number two. We're in the final stages of site selection and just working through some contract things. So we're excited about the prospect of what the future of this holds, and then I'll let Bob touch on where you can see the numbers. Yes. Susan, and take the question. I think there's a number of things that are benefiting the active adult buyer right now. One is they were first to kind of go to the sidelines they've certainly got more comfortable figuring out how to buy and figuring out how to make the decisions that they want to make as it relates to the retirement. The strong stock market behavior, I think, certainly plays a factor in that as retirement accounts are our flush. And then finally, the strong resale market has made it a seller's market, and so very easy for that active adult buyer to sell their existing home and move into 1 of our new communities. So our expectation is that the Webb brand will continue to be a big part of our business, and that buyer will continue to perform very well. Yes, Susan, the stance that we've taken on stock buybacks is that we'll report the news. What we have highlighted is it is going to continue to be part of our capital allocation. We paused for the second and the third quarter given the pandemic. But as you saw in the fourth quarter, we reinitiated a $75 million level. So we will be active throughout 2021. We're not going to provide forward guidance on the amount of the spend rather at the end of each quarter, we'll share with you what we've done."

We certainly do not take this for granted and appreciate the daily lives of millions of people continue to be disrupted. As such, we sincerely hope that you and your families remain healthy and are successfully navigating these difficult times. We appreciate your time this morning and look forward to discussing PulteGroup\u2019s outstanding third quarter results. As you read in this morning\u2019s press release, gains can be seen throughout our third quarter operating and financial results, including a 7% growth in home sale revenues, a 140 basis point increase in reported gross margin to 24.5%, a 70 basis point improvement in the overhead leverage and a 33% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Whether looking at national data or PulteGroup\u2019s specific numbers, housing demand remained strong throughout the third quarter. Reviewing our numbers for the period, year-over-year unit orders increased 36% and showed strength across all price points, buyer groups and geographies. Along with the ongoing strength in our first-time buyer group, we saw notable pickup among our move up and in particular active adult businesses. Given the potentially higher risks associated with COVID-19, active adult buyers had been a softer part of the market at the onset of the pandemic. In this most recent quarter, however, net new orders from our active adult communities exceeded over 2,000 signups for the quarter. This is the highest level for any quarter in over a decade. You\u2019ve likely heard me say before, that a robust housing market requires a strong \u2013 require strong demand across all the consumer groups. I believe this is what we are experiencing now, a strength among entry level and first time buyers is enabling demand at the higher price points. Further given limited housing supply and the ongoing price appreciation, existing homeowners can more easily sell their existing home and move to the next property. Given the positive supply and demand environment, we have taken the opportunity to raise prices across most of our communities. In fact, more than half of our divisions increased prices across their entire portfolio with the typical increase realized in the quarter, being in the range of 1% to 3%. Based on recent conversations, it\u2019s clear that market pricing dynamics are an important topic of discussion for investors and analysts these days. PulteGroup is typically a price leader, but we are always looking for the right balance of price and pace. Affordability is still important as well. So it is important that we not become overly aggressive and move prices too fast or too high, particularly within first-time communities, given market competition and normal affordability constraints among entry level buyers, pushing prices a few thousand dollars too high can stall sales very quickly. The outstanding demand environment has in turn created a production environment that I believe favors the big builders. Right now, builders who have an existing land pipeline, the ability to develop incremental lots and can maintain access to trade resources have a competitive advantage in the market. I will tell you that our scale was instrumental and the company exceeding its closing guidance for the quarter and as Bob will discuss in enabling us to raise our closing guide for the full year. PulteGroup runs a highly efficient construction operation. The market dynamics are such that we must be focused and disciplined and how we are approaching the business in the current operating environment. On the land side, we have geared up land acquisition and development activities after suspending much of this work earlier in the year when COVID-19 first hit. For example, our land acquisition spend of $463 million in Q3 was double that of this year\u2019s second quarter and almost 70% higher than the same period last year. While much of our land investment in the quarter was the completion of transactions we delayed at the outset of the pandemic, we are identifying opportunities to selectively increase land spend where appropriate. In addition to increasing our land spend, I would highlight that we continue to make our pipeline more efficient was 47% of our lots are now controlled via option. It is important to note that it takes longer to ramp up land production than it does to slow it down, especially in today\u2019s environment, but we have a solid land pipeline that will allow us to continue to run our business efficiently. Consistent with our return focus, we are intelligently manning our existing lot inventory to support ongoing sales and minimize gap outs, while driving high returns on invested capital. On the house side, our construction and procurement teams are doing a great job, keeping the production machine running, as demonstrated by our improved closing volumes. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this day-to-day work is also not without its challenges. I would highlight that labor is tight across all markets and can be adversely impacted by pandemic related absences. So we are working closely with our trades to help ensure resources are available in the near-term and as we work to grow volumes in the future. That said, the building materials environment is even more dynamic these days. For example, our Q4 deliveries will feel the initial impact from this year\u2019s spike in lumber cost, and while wood prices appear to have rolled over, we will be dealing with the effects of higher lumber costs for several quarters. Beyond wood, we have had to manage through sporadic disruptions on everything from appliances and cabinets to plumbing fixtures and windows. I can\u2019t complement our procurement teams enough for their efforts to minimize construction delays. In addition to having an outstanding organization to help us manage through today\u2019s market conditions, we are working from a position of operational and financial strength. We ended the quarter with a backlog of almost 15,000 homes and a cash balance of $2.1 billion. Given these numbers, we are clearly well-positioned to deliver strong fourth quarter results, while having the financial strength and flexibility to pursue our strategic business objectives as we head into 2021. In conclusion, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter results and how our business is positioned heading into Q4 and the year ahead. While we grow increasingly confident in the sustainability of housing demand, we are well aware that we are operating within a global pandemic that is not really under control. As such, we continue to adhere to the business strategies and disciplines, which have guided our business for the past decade. We remain focused on achieving high returns over the housing cycle, while intelligently growing our business and allocating capital consistent with our stated priorities of investing in the business, paying our dividend and returning capital through share repurchase. To that last point, we have reinstated our share repurchase program beginning in the fourth quarter. As is our practice, we will provide an update on our purchase activities when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of the quarter. Bob?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. In any market environment, our third quarter results were impressive, but given the backdrop and challenges of a global pandemic, I think the results were exceptional. As has been our practice this year, I\u2019ll be providing a high level review of the quarter, along with color on any impact COVID-19 had on our operations and on our outlook for the business. Looking at the business, our home sale revenues in the third quarter were up 7% over last year to $2.8 billion. The higher revenues for the period reflect the 4% increase in closing to 6,454 homes, in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $438,000. I would highlight the closings for the quarter came in slightly higher than our prior guidance, as we were able to sell and close more spec units than we anticipated in the period. Our higher average sales price in the third quarter was driven by higher prices within our move-up and active adult communities. First-time pricing was down slightly from last year, but this was driven by mix rather than an erosion in sales price. Demographic mix of third quarter closings was 30% first-time, 45% move-up and 25% active-adult. These numbers compare to last year\u2019s mix, which included 28% first-time, 46% move-up and 26% active adult. In the third quarter, our net new orders increased 36% over last year to 8,202 homes. Our average community count for the period was 892, which is an increase of 3% over last year. Average community count for the quarter was higher than our prior guidance since we were successful in accelerating community openings that had been anticipated to incur in the fourth quarter. Looking at sales activity during the quarter, demand and our volumes were relatively consistent across all three months. However, our September orders were modestly impacted by the fact the majority of our divisions took some level of action to manage sign of pace. Those actions were taken to properly manage our projected production environment with a view toward meeting customer expectations and reducing the risk of input cost inflation. In addition to the absolute increase in orders, we are extremely pleased by the strength and demand across each of the buyer groups. For the quarter first-time orders increased 39% to 2,443 homes. Move-up orders increased 39% to 3,697 homes and active adult orders were up 28% to 2062 homes. As Ryan mentioned, our active adult orders were the highest we\u2019ve reported for any quarter in the past decade. Our third quarter cancellation rate was up 12%, it was down from last year\u2019s 15% and our second quarter rate of 19%, and much more consistent with recent historic trend. As with our orders, the cancellation rate was stable over the quarter. Given the outstanding order activity in the period, we ended the third quarter with 14,962 homes in backlog. This is up 29% over last year. Our backlog value is up and even more significant at 32% to $6.6 billion, is our highest ending backlog value in more than 10 years. We ended the quarter with a total of 11,451 homes under construction. Of the homes currently under construction, 1,755 or 15% were specs. Our spec inventory is down from last year and down sequentially from the second quarter, due in large part to the pause in spec starts we put in place at the outset of the pandemic, coupled with the robust level of demand we\u2019ve experienced in the last several months. It is certainly our intent to increase spec starts and rebuild our inventory over time and our near term focus remains on delivering our backlog of sold homes. Based on the 11,451 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, we expect to deliver between 6,600 and 6,900 homes in the fourth quarter. As a result of the improved outlook for fourth quarter deliveries, coupled with the strength of our third quarter deliveries, our guidance for full year deliveries has also increased to a range of 24,350 to 24,650 homes. Given the average $441,000 selling price of homes in backlog, we expect the average sales price on fourth quarter closings to be in the range of $440,000 to $450,000. As always, the final mix in deliveries can influence the average sales price we ultimately realized in the quarter. Moving down the income statement, we are extremely pleased to report that our third quarter gross margin was 24.5%. This is an increase of 110 basis points over last year\u2019s adjusted gross margin and the sequential gain of 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Our margins continue to benefit from the strong demand environment, which has allowed us to raise prices and/or lower incentives in many of our markets. In the quarter, sales discount decreased 70 basis points from last year to 3.1% and fell 40 basis points from the second quarter of this year. As Ryan mentioned our future closings will begin feeling the impact of materially higher lumber costs, but we believe we\u2019re in a position to maintain gross margins at current levels over the balance of the year and expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the 24.5% realized in Q3. On a dollar basis, SG&A expense in the third quarter was $271 million, which was comparable to last year. Given the increase in 2020 closings and revenues, we were able to improve SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues by 70 basis points to 9.6%. Given our third quarter results, we now expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%, which indicates overhead leverage in the fourth quarter is expected to be consistent with our Q3 results on a percentage basis. Gains and overhead leverage in the quarter and for the year are being driven in part by the actions we took earlier in 2020 to lower expenses in response to COVID-19. Based on the rebound in sales activity compared to our expectations at the time we took those actions, we have reinstated nearly all of the employees we furloughed. We have also begun to selectively rehire personnel to maintain proper staffing levels within our sales, construction and financial services operations. While we had always assumed furloughed employees when we retained, the cost associated with new or rehired personnel have also been included in our SG&A guidance for 2020. Moving over to Financial Services. Third quarter pre-tax income effectively doubled over the prior year to $64 million. As has been the case for the prior two quarters, the increase in profitability reflects a favorable margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in our homebuilding operations and higher capture rates. Our mortgage capture rate for the third quarter was 86% compared with 84% last year. Looking at our taxes, income tax expense for the third quarter was $68 million. This represents an effective tax rate of 14%, which is down from an effective tax rate of 25.4% last year. Our rate for the quarter was lower than last year, because of energy tax credits recognized in the current period. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete permanent differences, like the energy tax credits that may arise. Completing my comments on the income statement, our reported net income for the third quarter was $416 million or $1.54 per share. Excluding the income tax benefit related to the energy credit, our adjusted net income was $363 million or $1.34 per share. Our prior-year net income for the third quarter was $273 million or $0.99 per share with an adjusted net income of $280 million or $1.01 per share. Switching to the balance sheet. Our strong financial performance and resulting cash flows, allowed us to end the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 30.8% down from 33.6% at the end of 2019. As previously discussed, we slowed our business investment activities in the second quarter as we assess the impact of COVID-19, and become more comfortable with the long-term trends for housing demand, we increased our land acquisition and development spend in the third quarter to $843 million. Some of this investment represents spend that had been delayed, but we remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve our plans to invest $2.7 billion in total land acquisition and development in 2020. We ended the quarter with 171,500 lots under control, as Ryan also mentioned, we are extremely pleased to report that 47% of these lots are controlled via option as we continue to make progress toward our goal of having 50% of our lots owned and 50% under option. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. Let me offer a few final comments, before opening the call for questions. The strong demand that we experienced throughout the third quarter has continued into the first few weeks of October. At a very high level, we see demand continuing to benefit from a number of factors, including exceptionally low interest rates, the ongoing movement of millennials into home ownership and some level of desire to move away from urban centers. With COVID-19 forcing houses to now service home, office, school, gym, entertainment center and countless other functions, our ability to design homes can meet the expanded needs of today\u2019s buyers, gives us yet another competitive advantage in the marketplace. Before closing the call today, I want to make sure that we recognize and thank our employees for the tremendous work that they did in the quarter and throughout 2020 thus far. This has been a year unlike any other we\u2019ve experienced. As a Group, our team has done an outstanding job adapting to changes in both our professional and personal lives, while continuing to deliver a superior experience to our homebuyers. It\u2019s their commitment to our customers and to each other, which allowed PulteGroup to again be certified as a great place to work, and to be recognized as one of the 2020 Best Workplaces for Women by Fortune Magazine in Great Place to Work. In a world where the competition for the best talent is fierce, we view the strength of our culture as an important competitive advantage. And finally, many of you know, and I\u2019ve spoken with Deb Still, the President and CEO of Pulte Financial Services. Deb is an acknowledged leader in the mortgage industry, and was just named one of Denver\u2019s Most Admired CEOs of 2020. We want to publicly congratulate Deb. We are truly fortunate to have her as Senior Leader at Pulte Group. Let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Jamie, if you will now open the queue, and we\u2019ll get started.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. Hope everyone is safe and healthy out there. First question I had was, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but just trying to get a sense of the cadence \u2013 monthly cadence of order trends in the quarter. And I would say positive that you were able to see that strength continue into the first few weeks of October. I was wondering if that was more close to what you\u2019re seeing perhaps in terms of the exit rate or what you were seeing in September. And also any color around the active adult segment, if you\u2019re seeing any acceleration there as you noted to a strong order book or interest improvement?\nRyan Marshall: Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Ryan. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the sign up question first. I think Bob shared in some of his prepared remarks, we saw very consistent sales order pace throughout all three months of the quarter. September was the exception to that where we started to see it slow down just a tad, but it was self-induced. So most of our divisions work to restrict sales either via price increases or lot releases or some combination of both and that was really an effort Mike, in order for us to make sure that we\u2019re not overly exposed on future cost increases within an elongated backlog as well as managing customer expectations. I\u2019d highlight the demand curve or the demand situation was quite consistent throughout all three months of the quarter. We\u2019ve seen things continue to be strong in the early weeks of October, both in the number of orders that we\u2019ve recorded as well as the demand. So things are continuing into the fourth quarter. And then finally, your question on active adult, we\u2019re really pleased with how that business has performed. We\u2019d lead highlighted in Q2 that it had been a softer part of our business given the age demographic of that buyer group, they were rightly so being very cautious because of COVID-19. I think as everybody has gotten more comfortable with PPE and social distancing, that buyer has come back into our sales offices and the things that I\u2019d repeat is we booked over 2,000 new orders in the quarter from our active adult communities, which is the highest that we\u2019ve had in over a decade.\nMichael Rehaut: All right. That\u2019s really helpful. And I appreciate you pointing that out. I guess maybe switching a little bit from the incoming order book to trying to get the units out the door. In your fourth quarter guide implies a backlog conversion rate in the mid-40s versus 59% a year ago. How can you say about the ability to deliver this, obviously, incredible backlog in homes over the next two or three quarters? Would you consider the year-over-year decline in backlog conversion as we see it in the fourth quarter is maybe being a low point in terms of the year-over-year differential and that from here we might be able to see that year-over-year decline narrow as production ramps? Or any type of forward-looking thoughts around the ability to obviously produce this tremendous amount of homes, how do you see that playing out?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, we\u2019re really pleased with how the production environment is running right now and as I highlighted on \u2013 in some of my prepared remarks, our production teams both the construction and the procurement teams have just done a real nice job of keeping things moving. So we\u2019re quite pleased with how things are rolling off of the production line. You\u2019ve probably heard me say before, Mike, we\u2019re not fans of backlog conversion. I think you can get some really goofy numbers. This is indicated by some of the percentages that you shared a minute ago. I really encourage you to look at conversion of units in production. I think it\u2019s a much better indicator of how efficiently the assembly line is working, and I think what you\u2019ll find with the guide that we\u2019ve given for Q4 is the conversion of our production is very consistent with where it\u2019s been over the last couple of years. As it relates to 2021, Mike, we\u2019re not giving any guidance on that at this point in time. We\u2019ll certainly try to do that as part of our Q4 call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Lovallo: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my questions. So the first one, maybe getting back to the September orders that were sort of deliberately slowed down given pricing. I assume there is a different actions along those lines. I\u2019m curious, Ryan, what degree of pricing did it actually take to slow those orders? And if it is the $1,000 or $2,000, I think you may have mentioned during the call, given that labor costs are likely going up, the number is still high, structural spends are still high. I mean, as we move into 2021, is it likely that we\u2019re going to see margin degradation across the industry?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike \u2013 John, good morning. We haven\u2019t given any guide on 2021 at this point in time. You did hear us say, as it relates to lumber that that will be a headwind for us over the next several quarters, just because of the way we buy. We buy on a 13-week trailing random lanes average which means just kind of now in the back half of the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll start to see the higher lumber costs come into our margin profile. As it relates to your question about price increases and slowing sales, that\u2019s a tough thing to quantify in an answer on a call like this, John. What I\u2019d tell you is that we have been very successful in pushing price as evidenced by a very rich 24.5% margin print in this quarter. So we think we\u2019ve done a nice job managing the pricing environment. We are sensitive, however to that delicate balance of affordability. And so while I think we are maximizing what the opportunity is, I think we\u2019re being careful not to kind of break the affordability demand model. The last thing that I\u2019d probably highlight is that it\u2019s not just price. In some cases, we are managing the sales pace with the number of lots that we\u2019re releasing. So it\u2019s a combination of a number of factors that we can use to manage the number of sales that we want to take in an environment like this given what we\u2019re doing on the production side.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe one for Deb. Deb, congratulations first of all, on your recognition. But the question is recognizing here that FHA and VA is I think 21% of your business relatively small, delinquencies at the FHA level are sort of mid-teens right now, nationally, I believe, I think the average is sort of mid single-digits. What are your views on sort of what happens across the industry when the moratorium on foreclosures ends at the end of the year?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, John, Deb\u2019s not on the call, but I\u2019ll try and answer that. It\u2019s Bob. It\u2019s a fair question. And I think the answer is that we\u2019re hopeful that there will be some sort of continued relief. I don\u2019t know that there is a big appetite today to introduce that kind of consternation into the market. If that were not to be the case, I think you\u2019d have some turbulence in the market. I don\u2019t know what that would translate into in terms of the current sales environment, but certainly it could create issues. Interestingly enough, most of the folks that own today have equity in their homes. So unlike the last downturn where people were upside down, one solution here is, people can sell their house and pay off the mortgage. So I don\u2019t want to be pollyannaish about it, but I\u2019m hopeful at least that this won\u2019t cause a lot of wreckage in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the great quarter and glad to hear you\u2019re all doing well. So, Ryan, I would love to drill in as well on the kind of the limiting lot releases or sales activity in September that you guys signed. And I guess the first question on that is, what exactly has the trend been on your cycle times in terms of kind of what you\u2019re quoting buyers from contract to delivery time now versus say six months or so ago? And the follow-on to that is, I\u2019m a little surprised that you\u2019re taking such aggressive steps there just given how strong your community count is held up here and you mentioned actually being able to pull forward some openings which is impressive. So recognizing you\u2019re not quantifying the monthly trends. Is it still safe to assume that on a year-over-year basis you\u2019re able to grow the order book, given your impressive land position?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, good morning Alan. There is a lot there. Let me see if I can kind of pick through some of that and give you some answers. As it relates to kind of the order trend over the quarter. The slight downtick in September was small. The year-over-year numbers in total for the quarter at 36%, they were fairly consistent as we moved, July, August, September. So I probably don\u2019t want to overplay that too much. The big takeaway that I think I\u2019d want you to have is the demand is great. To your point, we were successful in getting some communities opened a little earlier. And it\u2019s continued to kind of benefit our business not only in the current quarter, but certainly in future quarters as well. As it relates to cycle time, Alan, we\u2019ve been seeing things extend a little bit longer. It\u2019s not anything that I would characterize is overly problematic, but we\u2019ve seen the breaking ground to kind of finish delivery times expand just a tad. As far as when we\u2019re quoting deliveries Alan and in most of our system, it\u2019s right in the six-month range, which has been very consistent with how we\u2019ve operated the to be bill order model for a long time. So we\u2019re really not other than maybe a few specific communities here or there, we\u2019re quoting delivery times, it would be kind of in the March-April timeframe. And that\u2019s all reflective of what\u2019s in our backlog and what our lot availability situation looks like. So I may have missed a couple of the things you asked Alan, but maybe you can hit them in a follow-up if I missed anything.\nAlan Ratner: No, that was perfect, Ryan, I think you got everything there. And then secondly, if I\u2019m imagining this at the time of the year where you start to think about your next year budget and plans and probably are having conversations with your trades involved in that as well. And looking at the landscape out there, it\u2019s pretty clear starts need to accelerate rather sharply over the next few months. So any color you can give us in terms of conversations you\u2019re having with the trades in terms of how they are equipped to deal with this spike in activity that\u2019s likely to occur whether they are geared up for 2021 start activity. And I guess in the context of that, any comments you saw it leading builders of America kind of launched a new pilot program to try to improve some of the labor availability trend there as well. So any color you can give on that front would be great?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, I\u2019d probably just expand a little bit on the prepared comments that I made, Alan, where labor is tight, and I believe that is a big builder, which we\u2019re certainly in that category. We\u2019ve got an advantage. The fact that we\u2019ve got a large backlog. We run a very sophisticated orderly shop in terms of start rate and how things move through the production environment. Our \u2013 what our trade partners tell us, is they appreciate that. They appreciate the consistency, they can send the same crews to the same community, every day. They know they\u2019ve got a consistent level of production, which helps them be more efficient, more profitable. So while things are tight, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to manage through things and absence this related to COVID, is the proverbial curveball that you\u2019ve got to be anticipating, things like that can certainly have disruption on a trade partner shop. We think we\u2019re pretty well prepared for not only the fourth quarter but for next year, and I give credit to our local teams that have built and managed and continued to foster the strong relationships that we have with our trade partners. So we think we are \u2013 as is evidenced by the guide that we\u2019ve given for Q4 on the closing front, we think we\u2019re in a good spot to finish out the year strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Zener: Good morning, gentlemen.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Ken.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Ken.\nKen Zener: So what a year this is? I think a lot of people including myself, the rubber meeting the road, so to speak for the industry is that there\u2019s a lot of orders which to pay for that goes into backlog, but your actual inventory is what constraints your earnings fourth quarter as well as next year. So can you talk to this constraint, because your backlog to inventory ratio has never been lower at 3Q, it\u2019s about just under 80%, which is obviously leading to your fourth quarter guidance. But I think the big issue here is, your starts, what is the real constraint there? I mean, we hear constraints for appliances, I hear for windows, lately I\u2019ve been hearing it for garage doors, obviously Ryan, you commented on labor. But what is \u2013 it seems as though investors optimism around where starts can go seems to be at a bit of a disconnect from where the industry is able to produce homes? So what keeps \u2013 if you see all this demand, what really keeps you from accelerating that process somehow? I know we have longer construction cycle times, but what keeps you from starting more specs? Is it your land constraints? I know some builders run out of land for example to grow community counts, things like that, but what conservative nature that keeps you there or is it something that is industry wide that you really can\u2019t get around, therefore investors growth optimism might be too high as we look forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Ken, I wish that I could tell you that it was isolated to one thing. The reality is it\u2019s a lot of things and probably the first thing I\u2019d highlight is permits. So municipalities and government agencies have arguably probably been the most conservative in terms of shut down and slowdown. We can\u2019t start a home without a permit. And so that would be probably the thing that I would highlight has been the initial barrier that we\u2019ve got to overcome. I think we\u2019re doing a nice job doing that and then you go into the various production related kind of delays. You highlighted a number of them. We highlighted a number of them in our prepared remarks, where it\u2019s been appliances, it\u2019s been windows, it\u2019s been interior doors, it\u2019s been cabinets, none of them have persisted, but different things come and go based on a myriad of factors. And then you also highlighted lot availability. There are constraints around horizontal labor, land development labor as well, there is constraints around getting plat maps recorded and development plans approved through municipalities again. So there is a little bit of sand in the gears kind of everywhere, nothing that is completely shut the machine down and again I think that\u2019s where the big builders are favored because of our size and our scale in the processes and the systems that we have. We\u2019re able to really deliver some nice results as is evidenced by this most recent quarter. We\u2019re incredibly proud of what the business is doing. We\u2019re thrilled about kind of what we\u2019ve got projected for Q4, and as we finish up our planning for next year, we\u2019ll certainly provide some more guidance about 2021 as we get to the end of the fourth quarter. So I\u2019ve been in this business a long time, it seems that no matter the business environment that we\u2019re operating in, there are challenges that we have to deal with. This current time, no different. I can tell you right now though and I mentioned to some of my team over the past week, I\u2019d rather be dealing with these types of issues and small challenges been figuring out environment where demand is locking and you can\u2019t sell homes. So there are class problems, and I think we\u2019re well equipped to deal with them.\nKen Zener: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning guys. Great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to follow-up on community count. I mean, look, it actually increased sequentially and it was up 3% year-over-year. This is at the high end of the range that you guys were guiding to at the beginning of the year. Pretty surprising given all the pause during COVID, how stronger absorptions have been recently, just can you elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s \u2013 what occurred internally in the muni level. I know you mentioned there is constraints at the muni level, but just kind of indicate otherwise. So hopefully you can walk through some of those moving parts, and then the sustainability of this 892 level as we look into 4Q or even first half of 2021?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Tru, it\u2019s Bob. We \u2013 obviously we gave a guide coming into the third quarter where we thought we\u2019d be down a little bit. The teams are working really hard as Ryan has shared with you. There was probably a degree of conservatism in that because people were just coming out of the pandemic, kind of real lock-down, when we were talking to you folks back in July. So really all we did was pull forward some community count out of what we thought would start in the fourth quarter into the third quarter. I don\u2019t know that there is the ability to continue that through time and so yes, we\u2019ve done a refreshed look and we think actually our Q4 is going to be consistent with what we told you back in July. We had said it began down to 2% to 4% in July for the third and fourth quarters. So we are still there. We\u2019re obviously working hard to get stuff open. We obviously haven\u2019t provided a guide beyond the fourth quarter. But there is a limit to how much pull forward you can do. And so again teams did a great job. We don\u2019t think it repeats in the fourth quarter, but we will make every effort.\nTruman Patterson: Okay, okay. Thank you for that. And then just jumping over to the land market today with you all bumping up your land spend. How would you characterize land market? Is it overheated, just normal conditions that\u2019s generally pretty competitive. And are there any metros of concern that is specifically gotten over heated lately?\nRyan Marshall: Truman, it\u2019s Ryan. I\u2019d characterize the land market is competitive, which other than maybe in the depths of the great housing recession, the great recession.\nTruman Patterson: Yes.\nRyan Marshall: I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen land go on sale. It just doesn\u2019t. And there is a finite number of pieces that are within kind of the zones that are allowed to be kind of developed entitled, et cetera. And I think we see competitive behavior there, whether it\u2019s from other homebuilders or you\u2019ve got commercial and other uses for most good land parcels. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it is anything other than competitive. We\u2019re continuing to be smart. We\u2019re sticking to our underwriting fundamentals and the way that we have kind of approached land investment, so really no deviation from us on that front. And I would tell you, I don\u2019t know that I would characterize any markets has been \u2013 specific markets has been overheated and irrational at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. I think it\u2019s pretty unusual market right now where it seems like your ability to sell is pretty much just limited by the available product to sell? And so in that regard, I\u2019m curious as to how to think about what Pulte\u2019s max production capability is and how to sort of think about forecasting what that might be next year? So one way that I could think about it is that you\u2019ve given a guide of 6,900 deliveries in the fourth quarter. If I just sort of multiply that by four, would it be reasonable to think that that\u2019s your max production capacity right now? Or should I be looking at your \u2013 the orders you took in 3Q and say you probably wouldn\u2019t have taken those orders if you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to deliver on with good customer service and so maybe 4 times that number is kind of your max capacity? How should I be thinking about max capacity and how much do you think it can grow in any given year for a builder of your size?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, that\u2019s \u2013 all of those are difficult questions to answer, because they are essentially all 2021 guidance, which were not given at this point in time. I\u2019ll do my best to give you a little bit, and what I would tell you is that the business, both from a sales standpoint as well as a production standpoint it\u2019s seasonal. We see seasonal fluctuations in demand. We see seasonal fluctuations in what our max capacity is, mostly driven by weather. You know that we\u2019ve got a very big Midwest business and it gets more difficult to build homes in the middle of winter in the Midwest. We certainly do it, of course, but it\u2019s not as good or as fast in the summer months. So we really like the way that the production machine is running right now. We\u2019d certainly endeavor to increase that as much as we\u2019re able based on having available land and available trade resources and rest assured. We\u2019re working on that every single day to get our start rate up, because to your point, the demand environment is great. But like I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we think the better way to evaluate the efficiency and the efficacy of the production machine is a conversion of what\u2019s in production. And we think we\u2019re operating at a very consistent historical level as it relates to that. So look, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to put more into the machine and that\u2019s on both fronts, both the vertical side as well as on the horizontal landside.\nStephen Kim: If I hear you on the Midwest and the northern parts of the country, being a little bit more difficult to produce and seasonality therefore, but in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s one of those quarters where it gets pretty cold up there, and you\u2019ve given a number there. So and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re pretty much going lights out now, trying to build as much as you possibly can. So I mean kind of think that that number of times 4 is probably not a bad guess as to what your max capacity is today. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. And I\u2019m really trying to get at what your ability is to grow capacity in any given year and what does the things that actually are the limitations on that? Is it in your view, well, unless I shouldn\u2019t ask you what they are? It\u2019s more like what the number might be? Is it reasonable for example to think that a company of your size can grow capacity \u2013 production capacity on a sustained basis by about 20% a year? I mean is it unreasonable. Just wanted to understand, because it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve never really thought about before. Frankly you always thought about it on from the demand side.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, I think the best thing that I can give you is that we\u2019ve given the guide that we\u2019ve given for Q4 from a delivery standpoint and we\u2019re quite happy about that. We\u2019ve given community count guide that Bob just talked about in earlier question for Q4 as well. So I think you\u2019ve got probably as good a insight into the demand environment as probably we do and based on what we\u2019ve talked about. So I think you look at those things and you factor that into kind of your models for future years, what I\u2019ll tell you is that we are \u2013 we\u2019ll give kind of a more robust guidance for 2021 at the end of the fourth quarter. So we are \u2013 as I mentioned a minute ago, we\u2019re really seeking to grow our starts. We think that this environment favors the big builders. And so we\u2019re going to continue to endeavor to do that. I think the limiting factors are the same that they\u2019ve been and probably is consistent with what you\u2019ve heard from us in the past, it\u2019s land and labor. So can we continue to grow the labor force? We\u2019re trying to do that. And you heard a comment from Alan leading builders of America has got an effort under way, where we\u2019ve created a foundation that is solely focused on promoting the wonderful career opportunities that are available within the homebuilding industry. So we\u2019d hope to get some traction with that to increase the labor side land. I think the biggest impediment there is frankly the municipalities and working through the development system. And then lastly, and I think probably I\u2019d rank it third on the list is there is a little bit of stickiness in the supply chain. Again, nothing that we haven\u2019t been able to manage through, but it does create a little bit of stickiness.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Su.\nSusan Maklari: My first question is thinking about the active adult segment and the obvious improvement that you\u2019ve seen there over the quarter, how much of that do you think is coming from what we\u2019re seeing in the existing market the fact that some of these areas like the Northeast, the Midwest that were soft prior to this have really seen an improvement in there, and it\u2019s just become a lot easier for these people to sell their existing homes and get into these newer units? And I guess with that to, are you seeing geographic shift? Are you seeing a lot of people that are coming out of the northern half of the U.S. in the active adult segment and going into some of these Southern markets?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Susan. I think there is a couple of things going on. We are seeing a continuing trend of folks leaving Northeastern and Midwest markets and they\u2019re moving South. That\u2019s a trend that was going on pre-COVID. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s continued post-COVID. So we continue to see that benefiting our business given that we\u2019ve got a lot of properties in the South. As it relates to the active adult consumer, we think there is a couple of things going on there. One, this buyer has gotten more comfortable in resuming normal daily activities over the last couple of months and that includes figuring out what they\u2019re going to do in retirement. So we think we\u2019ve benefited from that buyer reengaging in the buying process. And then the comment that I made in my prepared remarks, our view is that a healthy housing environment requires all consumer groups to be participating. And certainly, we\u2019re seeing that right now, given the desire, the increased desire of individuals to have a single-family home, it\u2019s created an inventory shortage really in every price point of the market, it\u2019s created some pricing opportunities not only for us, but also for the resale side, and that\u2019s made it easier for individuals to sell their home. They\u2019ve sold their homes at really great prices, which gives them a lot of options and a lot of choices in terms of what they do on the new side. So I think what all that adds up to is a great operating environment for our company.\nSusan Maklari: Got you. Okay, thank you. And my next question is around the buybacks. I think it was really encouraging to hear that you are reinstating that program in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about the cadence of the buybacks coming back? What\u2019s given you the confidence to do that? And how you\u2019re thinking overall about capital allocation, and especially maybe as we think about the accelerated pace of demand, the need to keep supplying those lots in supporting the growth and just how you\u2019re balancing all those different factors looking out?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Su, it\u2019s a fair question. As Ryan mentioned on the call, we\u2019ll give you news on what we\u2019ve done after we\u2019ve done it as opposed to giving you a guide in terms of what our expectations are for spend. But the way we\u2019re looking at share repurchases is exactly the same as we were prior to the pandemic. And so our capital allocation process starts with investing in the business. To your question, that will be our primary source or use of capital. Second, we want to fund our dividend. Third, if we have excess capital, we will use it to buy back shares. Again all against the backdrop of leverage and cash capacity and so with $2 billion in the bank and a business that has strong cash generating right now, we can kind of do all of those things. I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, our expectation based on the guide we gave you as for spend, $800 million to $900 million on land acquisition development. In the fourth quarter we\u2019ll pay our dividend, we think we\u2019re cash generated after that. And so the $2.1 billion of cash probably gets bigger. We\u2019ve talked about that, that we\u2019ve got a maturity in the first quarter of next year that we are still likely to use cash to redeem, so 426 or $7 million. But with all that said, we still have a lot of capacity to invest in the business than we think actually to buy back stock. So we always use that lens. We always look out in time as we\u2019re thinking about the used sources and uses of capital in the business. So we don\u2019t see it is a choice between how do we want to invest in the business or buyback stock. We will be doing both.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk more about kind of the pricing power and dynamics you\u2019re seeing. I think you mentioned 1% to 3% price increases. I understand, it\u2019s widely vary, but wanted to get a sense on a relative basis. You talked about the constraint at the entry-level from an affordability standpoint, but on average is your entry level pricing increases trimmed in line or above or below those numbers that you\u2019re quoting? And I guess the second part of that question is, when you talk about the constraints, are we talking true or hard bumping up against FHA, VA limit at this point or is that more just a feel on moderating and metering out your price increases to avoid sticker shock?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: To your second question, Mike, it is the latter. So it\u2019s an affordability question, not a mortgage capability question. Now interestingly, our business and we\u2019ve talked about this before, even in that first-time space, we are typically a little bit at the higher end of the price range there. So it was mentioned earlier on the call, FHA, VA for us is and has been pretty consistently about 20% of our origination. So we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have a lot of consumers at that lower FICO score where you might be getting up against the capability to borrow. So I think at the end of the day as we look at it, it\u2019s just trying to make sure that we\u2019re pricing appropriately, but not pushing things so far that people have a choice. People always have a choice. And whether it\u2019s rental or competition, you don\u2019t want to get the affordability equation for that more a cost conscious buyer out of lack.\nMike Dahl: Got it, okay. And then the second question I had, you touched on lumber impact starting to hit in the fourth quarter, but as you articulate mostly kind of a first half issue. Could you just size up sequentially, what\u2019s the margin headwind that you\u2019ve got to absorb in 4Q versus 3Q? And I know you don\u2019t want to give 2021 guidance, but based on that lag and your backlog, you do likely have a sense of the magnitude that\u2019s coming at the beginning of next year. So any color you can give us on kind of how that steps up from 4Q to 1Q in terms of just what you\u2019ve got to absorb from a pricing standpoint to cover lumber?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike. We haven\u2019t broken that out. What we have talked about is that lumbers, about the sticks packages about 3% to 5% of our cost. So it\u2019s a meaningful percentage, but we haven\u2019t \u2013 3% to 5% of ASP is what the sticks packages. So it\u2019s a decent chunk of money. I think what you saw in the fourth quarter is that we\u2019ve had some nice price appreciation that we push through the system. We had a really nice margin in the quarter. We\u2019ve given kind of our margin guide for Q4, which we\u2019ve said is going to be consistent with Q3. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019ve been able to offset the increases that were coming through the system because of lumber with prices. As it relates to Q1 of next year, we haven\u2019t given any guidance on that yet, but we certainly will as part of our Q4 release.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen with that we\u2019ve reached the end of the allotted time for today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks.\nJim Zeumer: Hey, we appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. If you\u2019ve got any questions, certainly feel free to get back in touch with us through email or calls, and we will look forward to talking to you on our fourth quarter call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Over the past six months, it has grown increasingly clear that new home construction is an economic bright spot, an important contributor to sustaining some level of forward movement in the broader economy. We certainly do not take this for granted and appreciate the daily lives of millions of people continue to be disrupted. As such, we sincerely hope that you and your families remain healthy and are successfully navigating these difficult times. We appreciate your time this morning and look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding third quarter results. As you read in this morning's press release, gains can be seen throughout our third quarter operating and financial results, including a 7% growth in home sale revenues, a 140 basis point increase in reported gross margin to 24.5%, a 70 basis point improvement in the overhead leverage and a 33% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Whether looking at national data or PulteGroup's specific numbers, housing demand remained strong throughout the third quarter. Reviewing our numbers for the period, year-over-year unit orders increased 36% and showed strength across all price points, buyer groups and geographies. Along with the ongoing strength in our first-time buyer group, we saw notable pickup among our move up and in particular active adult businesses. Given the potentially higher risks associated with COVID-19, active adult buyers had been a softer part of the market at the onset of the pandemic. In this most recent quarter, however, net new orders from our active adult communities exceeded over 2,000 signups for the quarter. This is the highest level for any quarter in over a decade. You've likely heard me say before, that a robust housing market requires a strong \u2013 require strong demand across all the consumer groups. I believe this is what we are experiencing now, a strength among entry level and first time buyers is enabling demand at the higher price points. Further given limited housing supply and the ongoing price appreciation, existing homeowners can more easily sell their existing home and move to the next property. Given the positive supply and demand environment, we have taken the opportunity to raise prices across most of our communities. In fact, more than half of our divisions increased prices across their entire portfolio with the typical increase realized in the quarter, being in the range of 1% to 3%. Based on recent conversations, it's clear that market pricing dynamics are an important topic of discussion for investors and analysts these days. PulteGroup is typically a price leader, but we are always looking for the right balance of price and pace. Affordability is still important as well. So it is important that we not become overly aggressive and move prices too fast or too high, particularly within first-time communities, given market competition and normal affordability constraints among entry level buyers, pushing prices a few thousand dollars too high can stall sales very quickly. The outstanding demand environment has in turn created a production environment that I believe favors the big builders. Right now, builders who have an existing land pipeline, the ability to develop incremental lots and can maintain access to trade resources have a competitive advantage in the market. I will tell you that our scale was instrumental and the company exceeding its closing guidance for the quarter and as Bob will discuss in enabling us to raise our closing guide for the full year. PulteGroup runs a highly efficient construction operation. The market dynamics are such that we must be focused and disciplined and how we are approaching the business in the current operating environment. On the land side, we have geared up land acquisition and development activities after suspending much of this work earlier in the year when COVID-19 first hit. For example, our land acquisition spend of $463 million in Q3 was double that of this year's second quarter and almost 70% higher than the same period last year. While much of our land investment in the quarter was the completion of transactions we delayed at the outset of the pandemic, we are identifying opportunities to selectively increase land spend where appropriate. In addition to increasing our land spend, I would highlight that we continue to make our pipeline more efficient was 47% of our lots are now controlled via option. It is important to note that it takes longer to ramp up land production than it does to slow it down, especially in today's environment, but we have a solid land pipeline that will allow us to continue to run our business efficiently. Consistent with our return focus, we are intelligently manning our existing lot inventory to support ongoing sales and minimize gap outs, while driving high returns on invested capital. On the house side, our construction and procurement teams are doing a great job, keeping the production machine running, as demonstrated by our improved closing volumes. At the risk of sounding repetitive, this day-to-day work is also not without its challenges. I would highlight that labor is tight across all markets and can be adversely impacted by pandemic related absences. So we are working closely with our trades to help ensure resources are available in the near-term and as we work to grow volumes in the future. That said, the building materials environment is even more dynamic these days. For example, our Q4 deliveries will feel the initial impact from this year's spike in lumber cost, and while wood prices appear to have rolled over, we will be dealing with the effects of higher lumber costs for several quarters. Beyond wood, we have had to manage through sporadic disruptions on everything from appliances and cabinets to plumbing fixtures and windows. I can't complement our procurement teams enough for their efforts to minimize construction delays. In addition to having an outstanding organization to help us manage through today's market conditions, we are working from a position of operational and financial strength. We ended the quarter with a backlog of almost 15,000 homes and a cash balance of $2.1 billion. Given these numbers, we are clearly well-positioned to deliver strong fourth quarter results, while having the financial strength and flexibility to pursue our strategic business objectives as we head into 2021. In conclusion, we are extremely pleased with our third quarter results and how our business is positioned heading into Q4 and the year ahead. While we grow increasingly confident in the sustainability of housing demand, we are well aware that we are operating within a global pandemic that is not really under control. As such, we continue to adhere to the business strategies and disciplines, which have guided our business for the past decade. We remain focused on achieving high returns over the housing cycle, while intelligently growing our business and allocating capital consistent with our stated priorities of investing in the business, paying our dividend and returning capital through share repurchase. To that last point, we have reinstated our share repurchase program beginning in the fourth quarter. As is our practice, we will provide an update on our purchase activities when we report our fourth quarter earnings. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of the quarter. Bob? Thanks, Bob. Let me offer a few final comments, before opening the call for questions. The strong demand that we experienced throughout the third quarter has continued into the first few weeks of October. At a very high level, we see demand continuing to benefit from a number of factors, including exceptionally low interest rates, the ongoing movement of millennials into home ownership and some level of desire to move away from urban centers. With COVID-19 forcing houses to now service home, office, school, gym, entertainment center and countless other functions, our ability to design homes can meet the expanded needs of today's buyers, gives us yet another competitive advantage in the marketplace. Before closing the call today, I want to make sure that we recognize and thank our employees for the tremendous work that they did in the quarter and throughout 2020 thus far. This has been a year unlike any other we've experienced. As a Group, our team has done an outstanding job adapting to changes in both our professional and personal lives, while continuing to deliver a superior experience to our homebuyers. It's their commitment to our customers and to each other, which allowed PulteGroup to again be certified as a great place to work, and to be recognized as one of the 2020 Best Workplaces for Women by Fortune Magazine in Great Place to Work. In a world where the competition for the best talent is fierce, we view the strength of our culture as an important competitive advantage. And finally, many of you know, and I've spoken with Deb Still, the President and CEO of Pulte Financial Services. Deb is an acknowledged leader in the mortgage industry, and was just named one of Denver's Most Admired CEOs of 2020. We want to publicly congratulate Deb. We are truly fortunate to have her as Senior Leader at Pulte Group. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Hey, Mike. It's Ryan. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I'll take the sign up question first. I think Bob shared in some of his prepared remarks, we saw very consistent sales order pace throughout all three months of the quarter. September was the exception to that where we started to see it slow down just a tad, but it was self-induced. So most of our divisions work to restrict sales either via price increases or lot releases or some combination of both and that was really an effort Mike, in order for us to make sure that we're not overly exposed on future cost increases within an elongated backlog as well as managing customer expectations. I'd highlight the demand curve or the demand situation was quite consistent throughout all three months of the quarter. We've seen things continue to be strong in the early weeks of October, both in the number of orders that we've recorded as well as the demand. So things are continuing into the fourth quarter. And then finally, your question on active adult, we're really pleased with how that business has performed. We'd lead highlighted in Q2 that it had been a softer part of our business given the age demographic of that buyer group, they were rightly so being very cautious because of COVID-19. I think as everybody has gotten more comfortable with PPE and social distancing, that buyer has come back into our sales offices and the things that I'd repeat is we booked over 2,000 new orders in the quarter from our active adult communities, which is the highest that we've had in over a decade. Yes, Mike, we're really pleased with how the production environment is running right now and as I highlighted on \u2013 in some of my prepared remarks, our production teams both the construction and the procurement teams have just done a real nice job of keeping things moving. So we're quite pleased with how things are rolling off of the production line. You've probably heard me say before, Mike, we're not fans of backlog conversion. I think you can get some really goofy numbers. This is indicated by some of the percentages that you shared a minute ago. I really encourage you to look at conversion of units in production. I think it's a much better indicator of how efficiently the assembly line is working, and I think what you'll find with the guide that we've given for Q4 is the conversion of our production is very consistent with where it's been over the last couple of years. As it relates to 2021, Mike, we're not giving any guidance on that at this point in time. We'll certainly try to do that as part of our Q4 call. Yes, Mike \u2013 John, good morning. We haven't given any guide on 2021 at this point in time. You did hear us say, as it relates to lumber that that will be a headwind for us over the next several quarters, just because of the way we buy. We buy on a 13-week trailing random lanes average which means just kind of now in the back half of the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter, we'll start to see the higher lumber costs come into our margin profile. As it relates to your question about price increases and slowing sales, that's a tough thing to quantify in an answer on a call like this, John. What I'd tell you is that we have been very successful in pushing price as evidenced by a very rich 24.5% margin print in this quarter. So we think we've done a nice job managing the pricing environment. We are sensitive, however to that delicate balance of affordability. And so while I think we are maximizing what the opportunity is, I think we're being careful not to kind of break the affordability demand model. The last thing that I'd probably highlight is that it's not just price. In some cases, we are managing the sales pace with the number of lots that we're releasing. So it's a combination of a number of factors that we can use to manage the number of sales that we want to take in an environment like this given what we're doing on the production side. Yes, good morning Alan. There is a lot there. Let me see if I can kind of pick through some of that and give you some answers. As it relates to kind of the order trend over the quarter. The slight downtick in September was small. The year-over-year numbers in total for the quarter at 36%, they were fairly consistent as we moved, July, August, September. So I probably don't want to overplay that too much. The big takeaway that I think I'd want you to have is the demand is great. To your point, we were successful in getting some communities opened a little earlier. And it's continued to kind of benefit our business not only in the current quarter, but certainly in future quarters as well. As it relates to cycle time, Alan, we've been seeing things extend a little bit longer. It's not anything that I would characterize is overly problematic, but we've seen the breaking ground to kind of finish delivery times expand just a tad. As far as when we're quoting deliveries Alan and in most of our system, it's right in the six-month range, which has been very consistent with how we've operated the to be bill order model for a long time. So we're really not other than maybe a few specific communities here or there, we're quoting delivery times, it would be kind of in the March-April timeframe. And that's all reflective of what's in our backlog and what our lot availability situation looks like. So I may have missed a couple of the things you asked Alan, but maybe you can hit them in a follow-up if I missed anything. Yes, I'd probably just expand a little bit on the prepared comments that I made, Alan, where labor is tight, and I believe that is a big builder, which we're certainly in that category. We've got an advantage. The fact that we've got a large backlog. We run a very sophisticated orderly shop in terms of start rate and how things move through the production environment. Our \u2013 what our trade partners tell us, is they appreciate that. They appreciate the consistency, they can send the same crews to the same community, every day. They know they've got a consistent level of production, which helps them be more efficient, more profitable. So while things are tight, and I think we're going to continue to manage through things and absence this related to COVID, is the proverbial curveball that you've got to be anticipating, things like that can certainly have disruption on a trade partner shop. We think we're pretty well prepared for not only the fourth quarter but for next year, and I give credit to our local teams that have built and managed and continued to foster the strong relationships that we have with our trade partners. So we think we are \u2013 as is evidenced by the guide that we've given for Q4 on the closing front, we think we're in a good spot to finish out the year strong. Hi, Ken. Yes, Ken, I wish that I could tell you that it was isolated to one thing. The reality is it's a lot of things and probably the first thing I'd highlight is permits. So municipalities and government agencies have arguably probably been the most conservative in terms of shut down and slowdown. We can't start a home without a permit. And so that would be probably the thing that I would highlight has been the initial barrier that we've got to overcome. I think we're doing a nice job doing that and then you go into the various production related kind of delays. You highlighted a number of them. We highlighted a number of them in our prepared remarks, where it's been appliances, it's been windows, it's been interior doors, it's been cabinets, none of them have persisted, but different things come and go based on a myriad of factors. And then you also highlighted lot availability. There are constraints around horizontal labor, land development labor as well, there is constraints around getting plat maps recorded and development plans approved through municipalities again. So there is a little bit of sand in the gears kind of everywhere, nothing that is completely shut the machine down and again I think that's where the big builders are favored because of our size and our scale in the processes and the systems that we have. We're able to really deliver some nice results as is evidenced by this most recent quarter. We're incredibly proud of what the business is doing. We're thrilled about kind of what we've got projected for Q4, and as we finish up our planning for next year, we'll certainly provide some more guidance about 2021 as we get to the end of the fourth quarter. So I've been in this business a long time, it seems that no matter the business environment that we're operating in, there are challenges that we have to deal with. This current time, no different. I can tell you right now though and I mentioned to some of my team over the past week, I'd rather be dealing with these types of issues and small challenges been figuring out environment where demand is locking and you can't sell homes. So there are class problems, and I think we're well equipped to deal with them. Truman, it's Ryan. I'd characterize the land market is competitive, which other than maybe in the depths of the great housing recession, the great recession. I don't know that I've ever seen land go on sale. It just doesn't. And there is a finite number of pieces that are within kind of the zones that are allowed to be kind of developed entitled, et cetera. And I think we see competitive behavior there, whether it's from other homebuilders or you've got commercial and other uses for most good land parcels. So I wouldn't characterize it is anything other than competitive. We're continuing to be smart. We're sticking to our underwriting fundamentals and the way that we have kind of approached land investment, so really no deviation from us on that front. And I would tell you, I don't know that I would characterize any markets has been \u2013 specific markets has been overheated and irrational at this point in time. Yes, Stephen, that's \u2013 all of those are difficult questions to answer, because they are essentially all 2021 guidance, which were not given at this point in time. I'll do my best to give you a little bit, and what I would tell you is that the business, both from a sales standpoint as well as a production standpoint it's seasonal. We see seasonal fluctuations in demand. We see seasonal fluctuations in what our max capacity is, mostly driven by weather. You know that we've got a very big Midwest business and it gets more difficult to build homes in the middle of winter in the Midwest. We certainly do it, of course, but it's not as good or as fast in the summer months. So we really like the way that the production machine is running right now. We'd certainly endeavor to increase that as much as we're able based on having available land and available trade resources and rest assured. We're working on that every single day to get our start rate up, because to your point, the demand environment is great. But like I mentioned on one of the earlier questions, we think the better way to evaluate the efficiency and the efficacy of the production machine is a conversion of what's in production. And we think we're operating at a very consistent historical level as it relates to that. So look, we're going to do everything we can to put more into the machine and that's on both fronts, both the vertical side as well as on the horizontal landside. Yes, Stephen, I think the best thing that I can give you is that we've given the guide that we've given for Q4 from a delivery standpoint and we're quite happy about that. We've given community count guide that Bob just talked about in earlier question for Q4 as well. So I think you've got probably as good a insight into the demand environment as probably we do and based on what we've talked about. So I think you look at those things and you factor that into kind of your models for future years, what I'll tell you is that we are \u2013 we'll give kind of a more robust guidance for 2021 at the end of the fourth quarter. So we are \u2013 as I mentioned a minute ago, we're really seeking to grow our starts. We think that this environment favors the big builders. And so we're going to continue to endeavor to do that. I think the limiting factors are the same that they've been and probably is consistent with what you've heard from us in the past, it's land and labor. So can we continue to grow the labor force? We're trying to do that. And you heard a comment from Alan leading builders of America has got an effort under way, where we've created a foundation that is solely focused on promoting the wonderful career opportunities that are available within the homebuilding industry. So we'd hope to get some traction with that to increase the labor side land. I think the biggest impediment there is frankly the municipalities and working through the development system. And then lastly, and I think probably I'd rank it third on the list is there is a little bit of stickiness in the supply chain. Again, nothing that we haven't been able to manage through, but it does create a little bit of stickiness. Hi, Su. Yes, Susan. I think there is a couple of things going on. We are seeing a continuing trend of folks leaving Northeastern and Midwest markets and they're moving South. That's a trend that was going on pre-COVID. It's a trend that's continued post-COVID. So we continue to see that benefiting our business given that we've got a lot of properties in the South. As it relates to the active adult consumer, we think there is a couple of things going on there. One, this buyer has gotten more comfortable in resuming normal daily activities over the last couple of months and that includes figuring out what they're going to do in retirement. So we think we've benefited from that buyer reengaging in the buying process. And then the comment that I made in my prepared remarks, our view is that a healthy housing environment requires all consumer groups to be participating. And certainly, we're seeing that right now, given the desire, the increased desire of individuals to have a single-family home, it's created an inventory shortage really in every price point of the market, it's created some pricing opportunities not only for us, but also for the resale side, and that's made it easier for individuals to sell their home. They've sold their homes at really great prices, which gives them a lot of options and a lot of choices in terms of what they do on the new side. So I think what all that adds up to is a great operating environment for our company. Yes, Mike. We haven't broken that out. What we have talked about is that lumbers, about the sticks packages about 3% to 5% of our cost. So it's a meaningful percentage, but we haven't \u2013 3% to 5% of ASP is what the sticks packages. So it's a decent chunk of money. I think what you saw in the fourth quarter is that we've had some nice price appreciation that we push through the system. We had a really nice margin in the quarter. We've given kind of our margin guide for Q4, which we've said is going to be consistent with Q3. So I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to offset the increases that were coming through the system because of lumber with prices. As it relates to Q1 of next year, we haven't given any guidance on that yet, but we certainly will as part of our Q4 release."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. In any market environment, our third quarter results were impressive, but given the backdrop and challenges of a global pandemic, I think the results were exceptional. As has been our practice this year, I'll be providing a high level review of the quarter, along with color on any impact COVID-19 had on our operations and on our outlook for the business. Looking at the business, our home sale revenues in the third quarter were up 7% over last year to $2.8 billion. The higher revenues for the period reflect the 4% increase in closing to 6,454 homes, in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $438,000. I would highlight the closings for the quarter came in slightly higher than our prior guidance, as we were able to sell and close more spec units than we anticipated in the period. Our higher average sales price in the third quarter was driven by higher prices within our move-up and active adult communities. First-time pricing was down slightly from last year, but this was driven by mix rather than an erosion in sales price. Demographic mix of third quarter closings was 30% first-time, 45% move-up and 25% active-adult. These numbers compare to last year's mix, which included 28% first-time, 46% move-up and 26% active adult. In the third quarter, our net new orders increased 36% over last year to 8,202 homes. Our average community count for the period was 892, which is an increase of 3% over last year. Average community count for the quarter was higher than our prior guidance since we were successful in accelerating community openings that had been anticipated to incur in the fourth quarter. Looking at sales activity during the quarter, demand and our volumes were relatively consistent across all three months. However, our September orders were modestly impacted by the fact the majority of our divisions took some level of action to manage sign of pace. Those actions were taken to properly manage our projected production environment with a view toward meeting customer expectations and reducing the risk of input cost inflation. In addition to the absolute increase in orders, we are extremely pleased by the strength and demand across each of the buyer groups. For the quarter first-time orders increased 39% to 2,443 homes. Move-up orders increased 39% to 3,697 homes and active adult orders were up 28% to 2062 homes. As Ryan mentioned, our active adult orders were the highest we've reported for any quarter in the past decade. Our third quarter cancellation rate was up 12%, it was down from last year's 15% and our second quarter rate of 19%, and much more consistent with recent historic trend. As with our orders, the cancellation rate was stable over the quarter. Given the outstanding order activity in the period, we ended the third quarter with 14,962 homes in backlog. This is up 29% over last year. Our backlog value is up and even more significant at 32% to $6.6 billion, is our highest ending backlog value in more than 10 years. We ended the quarter with a total of 11,451 homes under construction. Of the homes currently under construction, 1,755 or 15% were specs. Our spec inventory is down from last year and down sequentially from the second quarter, due in large part to the pause in spec starts we put in place at the outset of the pandemic, coupled with the robust level of demand we've experienced in the last several months. It is certainly our intent to increase spec starts and rebuild our inventory over time and our near term focus remains on delivering our backlog of sold homes. Based on the 11,451 homes under construction at the end of the quarter, we expect to deliver between 6,600 and 6,900 homes in the fourth quarter. As a result of the improved outlook for fourth quarter deliveries, coupled with the strength of our third quarter deliveries, our guidance for full year deliveries has also increased to a range of 24,350 to 24,650 homes. Given the average $441,000 selling price of homes in backlog, we expect the average sales price on fourth quarter closings to be in the range of $440,000 to $450,000. As always, the final mix in deliveries can influence the average sales price we ultimately realized in the quarter. Moving down the income statement, we are extremely pleased to report that our third quarter gross margin was 24.5%. This is an increase of 110 basis points over last year's adjusted gross margin and the sequential gain of 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Our margins continue to benefit from the strong demand environment, which has allowed us to raise prices and/or lower incentives in many of our markets. In the quarter, sales discount decreased 70 basis points from last year to 3.1% and fell 40 basis points from the second quarter of this year. As Ryan mentioned our future closings will begin feeling the impact of materially higher lumber costs, but we believe we're in a position to maintain gross margins at current levels over the balance of the year and expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the 24.5% realized in Q3. On a dollar basis, SG&A expense in the third quarter was $271 million, which was comparable to last year. Given the increase in 2020 closings and revenues, we were able to improve SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues by 70 basis points to 9.6%. Given our third quarter results, we now expect full year adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%, which indicates overhead leverage in the fourth quarter is expected to be consistent with our Q3 results on a percentage basis. Gains and overhead leverage in the quarter and for the year are being driven in part by the actions we took earlier in 2020 to lower expenses in response to COVID-19. Based on the rebound in sales activity compared to our expectations at the time we took those actions, we have reinstated nearly all of the employees we furloughed. We have also begun to selectively rehire personnel to maintain proper staffing levels within our sales, construction and financial services operations. While we had always assumed furloughed employees when we retained, the cost associated with new or rehired personnel have also been included in our SG&A guidance for 2020. Moving over to Financial Services. Third quarter pre-tax income effectively doubled over the prior year to $64 million. As has been the case for the prior two quarters, the increase in profitability reflects a favorable margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in our homebuilding operations and higher capture rates. Our mortgage capture rate for the third quarter was 86% compared with 84% last year. Looking at our taxes, income tax expense for the third quarter was $68 million. This represents an effective tax rate of 14%, which is down from an effective tax rate of 25.4% last year. Our rate for the quarter was lower than last year, because of energy tax credits recognized in the current period. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete permanent differences, like the energy tax credits that may arise. Completing my comments on the income statement, our reported net income for the third quarter was $416 million or $1.54 per share. Excluding the income tax benefit related to the energy credit, our adjusted net income was $363 million or $1.34 per share. Our prior-year net income for the third quarter was $273 million or $0.99 per share with an adjusted net income of $280 million or $1.01 per share. Switching to the balance sheet. Our strong financial performance and resulting cash flows, allowed us to end the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 30.8% down from 33.6% at the end of 2019. As previously discussed, we slowed our business investment activities in the second quarter as we assess the impact of COVID-19, and become more comfortable with the long-term trends for housing demand, we increased our land acquisition and development spend in the third quarter to $843 million. Some of this investment represents spend that had been delayed, but we remain confident that we'll achieve our plans to invest $2.7 billion in total land acquisition and development in 2020. We ended the quarter with 171,500 lots under control, as Ryan also mentioned, we are extremely pleased to report that 47% of these lots are controlled via option as we continue to make progress toward our goal of having 50% of our lots owned and 50% under option. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan. Yes, John, Deb's not on the call, but I'll try and answer that. It's Bob. It's a fair question. And I think the answer is that we're hopeful that there will be some sort of continued relief. I don't know that there is a big appetite today to introduce that kind of consternation into the market. If that were not to be the case, I think you'd have some turbulence in the market. I don't know what that would translate into in terms of the current sales environment, but certainly it could create issues. Interestingly enough, most of the folks that own today have equity in their homes. So unlike the last downturn where people were upside down, one solution here is, people can sell their house and pay off the mortgage. So I don't want to be pollyannaish about it, but I'm hopeful at least that this won't cause a lot of wreckage in the market. Hi, Ken. Yes, Tru, it's Bob. We \u2013 obviously we gave a guide coming into the third quarter where we thought we'd be down a little bit. The teams are working really hard as Ryan has shared with you. There was probably a degree of conservatism in that because people were just coming out of the pandemic, kind of real lock-down, when we were talking to you folks back in July. So really all we did was pull forward some community count out of what we thought would start in the fourth quarter into the third quarter. I don't know that there is the ability to continue that through time and so yes, we've done a refreshed look and we think actually our Q4 is going to be consistent with what we told you back in July. We had said it began down to 2% to 4% in July for the third and fourth quarters. So we are still there. We're obviously working hard to get stuff open. We obviously haven't provided a guide beyond the fourth quarter. But there is a limit to how much pull forward you can do. And so again teams did a great job. We don't think it repeats in the fourth quarter, but we will make every effort. Yes, Su, it's a fair question. As Ryan mentioned on the call, we'll give you news on what we've done after we've done it as opposed to giving you a guide in terms of what our expectations are for spend. But the way we're looking at share repurchases is exactly the same as we were prior to the pandemic. And so our capital allocation process starts with investing in the business. To your question, that will be our primary source or use of capital. Second, we want to fund our dividend. Third, if we have excess capital, we will use it to buy back shares. Again all against the backdrop of leverage and cash capacity and so with $2 billion in the bank and a business that has strong cash generating right now, we can kind of do all of those things. I know we've talked about this in the past, our expectation based on the guide we gave you as for spend, $800 million to $900 million on land acquisition development. In the fourth quarter we'll pay our dividend, we think we're cash generated after that. And so the $2.1 billion of cash probably gets bigger. We've talked about that, that we've got a maturity in the first quarter of next year that we are still likely to use cash to redeem, so 426 or $7 million. But with all that said, we still have a lot of capacity to invest in the business than we think actually to buy back stock. So we always use that lens. We always look out in time as we're thinking about the used sources and uses of capital in the business. So we don't see it is a choice between how do we want to invest in the business or buyback stock. We will be doing both. To your second question, Mike, it is the latter. So it's an affordability question, not a mortgage capability question. Now interestingly, our business and we've talked about this before, even in that first-time space, we are typically a little bit at the higher end of the price range there. So it was mentioned earlier on the call, FHA, VA for us is and has been pretty consistently about 20% of our origination. So we're not \u2013 we don't have a lot of consumers at that lower FICO score where you might be getting up against the capability to borrow. So I think at the end of the day as we look at it, it's just trying to make sure that we're pricing appropriately, but not pushing things so far that people have a choice. People always have a choice. And whether it's rental or competition, you don't want to get the affordability equation for that more a cost conscious buyer out of lack."

Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Jim, and good morning. I am very pleased to report that the recovery in new home demand that we experienced over the course of the second quarter was nothing short of outstanding. Our second quarter results show a remarkable rebound in demand as April net new orders fell 53% from last year, only to see year-over-year orders increased 50% for the month of June. Led by strong demand among first-time buyers, we saw meaningful improvement across all buyer groups and geographies as the quarter advanced. This improvement culminated in June orders increasing 77% for first time, 48% for move up and 21% for active adult over June of last year. The rebound in demand during the quarter resulted in our aggregate second quarter orders declining only 4% from last year. We are very encouraged by the fact that the momentum of this dramatic recovery continues as demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of July. Improving industry dynamics in combination with disciplined business practices allowed us to drive meaningful gains in our operating results and financial position. These gains include revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved overhead leverage, which when coupled with our prudent financial planning, and strong cash generation, leave us in the position of strength as we work through the balance of the year. For all the positive dynamics we are experiencing in our business. It's clear that COVID-19 continues to act a severe toll on the economy, and more importantly, the people of our country. It goes beyond any business implications, but simply as human beings, one cannot look at the ongoing health impacts and loss of life and see it as anything but a tragic situation. With this as a backdrop, it is our heartfelt hope that everyone on this call, your families as well as our employees, trade partners and the communities we serve remain healthy and safe. From our health officials to our front-line workers, to pharmaceutical companies, the efforts to battle this virus has been heroic. Before we get into discussing our second quarter financial results, let me provide a brief update on the impacts of the pandemic and insights on how we are running the business currently. At the outset of the pandemic, we closed our sales centers and model homes and quickly pivoted to working remotely and selling virtually. I am pleased to say that we began reopening our sales centers and models in early May. And we are now fully open and staff to work with our walk-in and by appointment customers. As you would expect, our salespeople are using appropriate PPE, are adhering to social distancing practices and are following enhanced cleaning and disinfecting processes to help protect the health of our employees and customers. While our sales centers are open, we are interacting with customers on their preferred terms because not everyone is comfortable with in-person meetings. We continue to take full advantage of available technology and tools that have successfully supported our efforts to sell homes virtually. Except for a handful of markets, home building was deemed an essential service from the start of COVID-19. So disruptions to our construction operations were minor even during the early stages of the pandemic. At present, our operations are fully functional in all markets across the country. Again, in partnership with our trades, we are using appropriate PPE and are adhering to social distancing practices to protect workers on the job site and in the homes. And finally, our financial services group truly did an outstanding job, adjusting their business model to work remotely and handle every aspect of the mortgage and closing processes virtually. At present, personnel are still working off-site, but as demonstrated by the strong second quarter financial results and high capture rate, the team continues to perform at a very high level. Thanks to the tremendous effort of our purchasing team, working in conjunction with our suppliers. Our supply chain has held up well with minimal disruptions to our home building operations. Working closely with sales and construction, our purchasing group has been able to navigate around potential shortages and ensure ongoing availability of key building products. Given the rebound in housing, we have been increasing our land acquisition and development spend, this primarily relates to land deals where we negotiated purchase delays of anywhere from 30 to 90 days. We are now completing most of these transactions when the new closing date arrives. Unfortunately, it's clear that COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon. So we remain disciplined and thoughtful in our land investments. This includes increasing our use of options, which now account for 46% of the lots that we control. On the people side, I am very pleased to say that improved market dynamics have allowed us to bring back the majority of the employees that we furloughed during the quarter. We have also had the opportunity to rehire a small number of the people we released in May, which is a good feeling. I would note that most of the individuals returning to our organization are in the field construction roles. Obviously, the demand for new homes has experienced a dramatic rebound over the past eight to 10 weeks, following the initial shock from COVID-19. While housing demand certainly continues to benefit from historically low interest rates, analyzing the drivers of demand suggests there are likely additional factors that work as well. First, looking at the number of internet searches related to home buying, the data indicate that there has been an increase in consumer interest in homes. Particularly new homes, utilizing available Google trends data, we can view patterns for specific search terms commonly associated with buying a new home. Despite the overlay of COVID-19 searches for new home related terms has been growing since mid-March. In fact, we have routinely seen multi-year highs in the number of searches related to shopping for a new home. I would note that we have seen a similar pattern in terms of Google searches for Del Webb, which are up dramatically in May and June. In fact, unique visitors to our Del Webb site are now approaching 70,000 per week and are trending higher than they were at this time last year. Second, while we can debate the magnitude, ZIP code level analysis on buying patterns points to a movement of renters and homeowners from urban centers into the surrounding suburbs. Based on an internal survey, roughly half of our division presidents report that their business has experienced a modest increase in demand from urban buyers, while several of our divisions referenced a material increase in such demand. And finally, we see the third and possibly largest driver of demand for new homes being the very limited supply of existing housing stock available today. At the end of May, the total housing inventory was 1.55 million units, which was down 19% from the prior year. I'm sure we can all appreciate that it's hard to be comfortable opening your home to strangers during a global pandemic. The strong demand has also helped to absorb some of the spec inventory, which had built up in the system in March and April. Data show that in markets where we operate the number of quick-move-in homes available for sale fell by 16% from the end of March through the end of June, a lot has been made about the advantage of having spec units available. But the draw down in supply and a build cycle of less than 80 days for a first-time buyer product allows our build-to-order model to compete very effectively and with less risk. The combination of strong demand and limited inventory has also allowed us to raise prices across many of our communities. In fact, more than half of our divisions report raising prices in 50% or more of their communities. The typical price increase is in the range of 1% to 3% and includes changes in base price and/or reductions in incentives. The positive change in market dynamics from April to the end of June has been dramatic and gives us greater confidence about the business moving forward. As such, we are reestablishing guidance for the remainder of 2020, which Bob will provide as part of his review of our second quarter results. In this regard, I want to say that the volatility caused by the pandemic is unlike anything this industry has experienced, even during the worst of the Great Recession. The swings in demand during the second quarter alone were fast and severe, buyer demand is clearly experienced a dramatic recovery in the quarter and has remained strong through the first three weeks of July. That being said, COVID hotspots continue to grow in size and number, which in turn is slowing down the reopening of state and local economies. It is impossible to forecast how these dynamics will unfold in the coming weeks and months. For PulteGroup, we will be optimistic about future market conditions that remain very disciplined and measured in how we manage our business. Now, let me turn the call to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Bob?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Similar to our first quarter call, I won't go through our typical detailed analysis of our income statement and balance sheet, but I'll talk about the business in the context of COVID-19. Also given the volatility in market conditions during the quarter, where needed, I will provide some insights on the change in our business as the quarter progressed. And finally, as Ryan stated, we will be providing guidance on our expected third quarter and full year 2020 results. For our second quarter, wholesale revenues increased 3% to $2.5 billion, the higher revenues in the period were driven by a 6% increase in closings to 5,937 homes, partially offset by a 3% decrease in average sales price to $416,000. Consistent with recent trends, the lower average sales price primarily reflects changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed. I would highlight that these changes were exaggerated in the quarter as the pandemic caused temporary market shutdowns in several higher price locations, including Northern California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and the State of Washington. Closings for the quarter consisted of 31% first time, 44% move up and 25% active adult. This compares with prior year closings of 28% first time, 46% move up and 26% active adult. Net new orders for the second quarter, totaled 6,522 homes, which is down 4% from last year, given that we started the quarter with April orders down 53% from the prior year, this represents a tremendous turnaround in demand. For the entire quarter, first time orders were up 17% to 2,327 homes, move up orders were down 7% to 2,873 homes and active adult orders were down 22% to 1,322 homes. We've gotten questions over the quarter about how active adult buyers are behaving. So I want to note that demand among this group improved in each month to two quarter. In fact, June orders were up 21% over last year with active adult buyers more comfortable going out and with the amenities now reopened in our communities, the buying and selling process is feeling more routine. At the same time, active adult buyers are finding a strong demand environment that they have to sell an existing home, so we are optimistic that an ongoing recovery in this part of our business. For the quarter, our cancellation rate was 19% compared with 14% last year, the higher cancellation rate was driven by elevated cancellations in April, as the cancellation rate felt only 12% of our orders in June. As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, we have seen that buyers are excited to close. We ended the second quarter with 13,214 homes in backlog, which is an increase of 12% over last year. At the end of the quarter, we had 10,946 homes under construction, which is down 4% from last year. But the homes currently in production, 2,121 or 19% were specs. In aggregate, the lower number of homes under construction is consistent with our decision to tightly manage starts as demand collapsed early in the pandemic, while we are focused on building sold homes, we have started to increase the number of speculative starts in an effort to get us closer to our target ratio of specs, representing approximately 25% to 30% of units in production. Based on our backlog and the number of units in production, we currently expect to deliver between 6,000 and 6,300 homes in the third quarter, further, we now expect deliveries for the full year to be in the range of 23,500 to 24,000 homes, with an average price and backlog of approximately $438,000, we expect third quarter ASP to be in the range of $425,000 to $435,000. For the full year, we expect average sales price on deliveries to be between $420,000 and $430,000. As always, the mix of deliveries will influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Back to my review of our second quarter results, gross margin for the quarter was 23.9%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points over last year and a sequential gain of 20 basis points from the first quarter. Margins in the quarter benefited from the strong sales environment in the back half of 2019, when the majority of these homes were sold. Our margins also reflect lower incentives, as sales discounts were down 40 basis points from last year to 3.5% and down 10 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Given today's favorable demand conditions, we expect gross margins to remain strong through the back half of the year. Currently, we expect gross margin for the third quarter to be in the range of 23.9%, 24.2% with full year gross margin to be in the range of 23.8%, 24.1%. Our reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $197 million or 8% of home sale revenues included in our reported SG&A was a $61 million pre-tax benefit, resulting from the reversal of an insurance reserve partially offset by the previously announced $10 million pre-tax charge or severance resulting from staffing actions taken in the quarter. Excluding these two items, our adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $247 million or 10% of home sale revenues, which is 80 basis points better than in the second quarter of last year. The improvement in overhead leverage was driven by the volume growth realized in the quarter, along with the actions taken to lower overhead expenses in response to changing market conditions. While we typically give guidance only for full year SG&A expenditures, we are providing Q3 numbers as well. We currently expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.4% of revenues for the third quarter and our adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7% of revenues for the full year. Turning to financial services, our operations generated $60 million of pre-tax income, representing an outstanding 141% increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by an improved margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in the company's home building operations and a higher capture rate. In fact, our mortgage capture rate for the second quarter increased to 87% from 81% last year. The improved capture rate reflects the opportunity our home building operations are finding to leverage Pulte Mortgage in providing value-added services to our customers. The investments our financial services team have made in building their technology platform allowed them to transition to offsite operations with virtual processing without missing a beat. Closing out my comments on our income statement, our second quarter income tax expense was $108 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. This compares to tax expense of $80 million for an effective rate of 24.9% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than last year and our historic guidance, primarily because of energy tax credits realized in the periods. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete permanent differences like the energy tax credits that may arise. Our reported net income for the second quarter was $349 million or $1.29 per share, while our adjusted net income was $311 million or $1.15 per share. Prior year net income for the period was $241 million or $0.86 per share. Moving over to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash, after having repaid the $700 million we drew down from our revolving credit facility in March. In addition to our strong operating results, our second quarter cash position benefited from our actions to strategically defer investments in land and vertical construction costs, as well as our decision to suspend our share repurchase activities. Having repaid the revolver, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 32.1%, while our net debt to capital ratio felt a 15.5%. In the second quarter, we invested $452 million in land acquisition and developments, which is down from $619 million in Q1 of this year and $857 million in the second quarter of last year. I would note that last year spend included $136 million related to the American West acquisition. Through the first six months of 2020, we have invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and related development. Given the improving market conditions, we are increasing our investment in both land development and the purchase of new land assets. As such, we expect our full year land investment will be approximately $2.7 billion, as we begin completing land deals that we previously deferred. I'd like to highlight that the pandemic and any material impact it has on housing demand or the consumer and the broader economy could influence how much capital we ultimately invest. We ended the quarter with 163,000 lots under control, of which 46% are options. This represents our highest option position in over a decade, as we continue to progress toward our target of 50% owned and 50% options. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments, Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Operating in the midst of a global pandemic and extreme market volatility, the company delivered an outstanding quarterly earnings performance, while generating strong cash flows that further strengthened our financial position and flexibility. I want to say that we are certainly encouraged by the rebound and acceleration in demand that we've experienced over the past few months. While there are different thoughts on the drivers of this demand, what is clear is that the desire for home ownership remains high for all buyer groups, whether it's the first time buyer looking to exit a shared living space or the active adult buyer looking for a new adventure, people want a place to call their own. That being said, we continue to monitor the acceleration of COVID-19 cases in cities across the country, along with delays and even step backs in the reopening of local economies. Given these conditions, we remain committed to taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach to running our business. While we have had to adjust business practices, our fundamental goals and strategies have not changed, as we continue to focus on generating high returns through time. This means allocating capital and alignment with our stated priorities of investing in the business, paying our dividend and when appropriate returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. This also means operating against the same risk weighted criteria that we have used so successfully to invest in land for the past eight years. Although, given today's environment, we are certainly working to assess any elevated risks associated with operating during a global pandemic. I want to thank all of our teams from our corporate and division offices to our frontline field personnel for their tremendous efforts during these very challenging times, everyone has pulled together as we transitioned our operations to work remotely and then where appropriate moved back on site as sales centers could reopen and markets exited their lockdowns. From implementing new technologies and virtual selling strategies, we\u2019re using PPE and appropriate social distancing, our people have done smart, fast, resilient and maybe most of all invested in each other and in our company. Let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Ossowski: Great. Thanks Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can ask \u2013 so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of the call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thanks, and Sharon would ask, could you just repeat the instructions and we'll get started.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lovallo: Thank you for taking my question. The first one is, obviously the bounce that we've seen has been remarkable in terms of strength and sustainability here. But I guess the question is, going forward, the big question in our mind is, how sustainable is this going to be? And I know that's a very difficult thing to answer, but what I'm wondering is, what are the things that you're kind of monitoring to gauge whether you should kind of step on the gas here or maybe pull back a bit?\nRyan Marshall: Well, John it's Ryan and good morning, thanks for the question. We're monitoring all the same metrics that we typically monitor when we run the business. So we're looking at what's going on with consumer behavior, what are we seeing the desire for home ownership, what's happening in a new home searches on the internet, some of the things that we described in our prepared remarks. We clearly pay attention to what's happening in the resale market, which still to this day remains our biggest competitor. Certainly we have new home competitors, but with the majority of home sales being dominated by resale, we certainly pay attention to what's happening there. We look at what's happening in the job market with unemployment, with job creation, et cetera. So we're really focused, John, the biggest thing that I would emphasize is we're focused on delivering high returns through time. And so while we certainly have got a little bit of a tailwind at our back right now with consumer demand, the investments that we're making, the way that we're running the company, the way that we're managing debt, the way that we're managing cash, we're very much focused on those being through cycle type you movements. The other thing, I think in the more kind of short-term that we've got to pay attention to is state, shelter in place orders, and what might potentially happen as local economies may revert back to Phase 1, Phase 2, et cetera, certainly that could have an impact on the kind of shorter-term demand that we might see in a sales office.\nJohn Lovallo: That's helpful. And then maybe just on the Vegas market specifically in American West. So what \u2013 are you seeing any improvement there as some of the casinos have begun to reopen?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Surprisingly John, if you remember, at the end of the first quarter call, I highlighted Vegas as a market that we were quite concerned about given the dominance of tourism and travel related economy. That market has performed incredibly well, and in fact had a spectacular June. So with the reopening of the casinos, even at a limited capacity, we've seen a lot of the local workers go back to work. And folks are back in the casinos and staying at the hotels. So our Vegas business did quite well in June, and we're very happy about that.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mike Dahl. Please state your company. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Chris on from Mike. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question, which I want to ask, what's your latest price versus a thoughts are in the current demand environment. You guys mentioned you were able to raise pricing over 50% of your communities, which is kind of in line with what we were seeing as well. And I was hoping to see, if your thinking has changed at all in terms of pricing. When should we think about price moving up past that 1% to 3%, you mentioned, given work demands running right now?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Chris. It's the same process that we've always used, which is we evaluated on a community-by-community basis, taking into consideration what's happening in the local resale market that we compete against as well as what we're doing in our competitive efforts against our other new home competitors. Those are the things that really influence, what's going on in our pricing decisions. We're certainly focused on driving the best through cycle returns that we can. And so, that continues to be the overarching theme and umbrella that we use to make decisions. I would remind you that, you need to really pay attention to rent as well, especially with our first time buyer business that is an alternative source of shelter for that consumer. And so they're going to constantly look at the economics of what's more advantageous. So while demand is good, we don't believe that you can raise prices in an unfettered work.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That makes sense. And then just my second question, I probably could drill in a little deeper into the latest demand trends you're seeing in some of the COVID hotspots in Texas, Florida, Arizona. I really, it's tough to gauge what demand ultimately look like there, but for the last few weeks, have you seen any sort of decipherable trends as far as the impact there?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So those markets have been incredibly strong for us, Chris. The three that you highlighted Arizona, particularly Phoenix, Texas and Florida, not only are they hot in temperature right now, they're also hot in terms of sales pace. So despite the fact that there has been an increase in COVID cases in those markets, they have been some of the most aggressive in reopening the local economies. And we've certainly seen that translate in success in our sales offices as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Appreciate the color guys.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi, thanks, good morning, everyone, and congrats on the recent results.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Mike.\nMichael Rehaut: Where that hit, and I know it's a little tough to go too detailed. But the June result is obviously, incredibly strong and you talked about July showing strength as well. But I think there is obviously a lot of focus around the exit rate coming out of the quarter. I assume you don't want people to model 50% order growth in the back half of the year. So it's just trying to get a sense of, maybe to give a rough idea of so far, how July is trending, obviously there is a lot of movement within the quarter, there could be some pent up demand, it can also be some increased incremental demand from meets and perhaps COVID itself. But any directional help around how July is going so far and around any expectations of, where that order growth may or may not settle out in the third quarter would be helpful. I know it's very forward looking, but the numbers are just very, very volatile currently.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, good morning and thanks for the question. June was a spectacular month and we're very pleased with that. To your point, I do think there was some pent up demand for a lot of the reasons that we listed in our prepared remarks and some of the things that you've highlighted. So to assume that growth rates like that would continue forward, that's \u2013 the time will tell. What I will tell you about July and we're not going to deviate from our traditional practice other than to comment on the how the first three or so weeks of July have been. The first three weeks in July had continued to be strong, albeit on a somewhat seasonally adjusted basis as we go into the kind of dog days of summer. So we're very happy with how July has performed, we're optimistic about kind of what the summer selling months will hold for our business. But we\u2019ll stop short of kind of providing a full forecast for the third quarter.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. I appreciate that. And obviously had to try there, because again, there is a tremendous amount of focus. Second question, I guess, talking about the price increases and about half your communities, which is encouraging. Obviously, you've had a spike in lumber costs as well. Traditionally, actually when you've had cost inflation, you've actually had the industry has to believe and had margin expansion is top line gains exceed, the cost side of the business. Do you see the current environment as being anything different and could you mention obviously trying to not allow pricing to get out of hand you don't want to price yourself out maybe similar to a couple of years ago? But how do you see your ability to at least offset cost inflation in the current environment?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Hey Mike, it's Bob and a fair question. Certainly lumber has trended to candidly all time highs. We've given a guide on our margins for the balance of the year. And I think most folks are familiar with the way we purchased lumber, it's on a trailing 13 week basis. And so our lumber package pricing for the balance of the year is pretty much set. So these increases will really be more of an impact in 2021, depending on how the market, the lumber market performs over the next three to six weeks, 12 weeks. So on balance, actually the market is pretty good for commodities, lumber being an outlier. And I think most builders were able to try and work with their trades to drive pricing down, we'll see some benefit for that, that's incorporated into our guide for the balance of the year twice you see margin improving as we continue through the year. Given the pretty quick ramp up in the business, I think it's reasonable to expect that the trades will be looking for some of that money back as time goes by. In a world where we can get some modest price increases that's to your point, usually sufficient for us to offset it those potential increases in costs. So we're not giving a guide on margin beyond 2020, but you can tell from the guide for the balance of the year, which is up from where we were in Q3, which is \u2013 sorry, Q2, which was up from Q1 and up a lot from last year that the market is pretty good. And so we are always conscious of overall affordability to Ryan's point, rent is always the biggest competitor and\\or resale, but we feel pretty good about our pricing opportunities and our cost controls today.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kenneth Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Zener: Good morning, everybody.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Ken.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hi, Ken.\nKenneth Zener: Can you \u2013 given your \u2013 appreciate the outlet and the volatility. Given your closing guidance for 3Q, it's actually a little higher as a percent of your units under construction than is normal, which reflects slower initial construction phase in the second quarter. But can you talk to how you think the industry or Pulte in particular might be constrained in terms of production? There is obviously a lot of order growth, demand in a time of job losses. But, what is really constraining your growth? I mean, is it that your build construction times, you don't want to go out more than six months? You made very specific comments around a pre-build model, it's not what you want to do, but you said you guys can do first time buyers, I believe in 80 days. So what is really the protection constraints you're seeing within given communities that kind of limits your units under construction as we think about where you can go in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Good morning, Ken and thanks for the question. When we think about production constraints, it's \u2013 the number one continues to be labor, which is not a new theme, the entire industry has talked about that for a long time. And it's one of the big reasons that we made the acquisition of ICG down in Jacksonville earlier in the years, we felt that moving to more offsite type manufacturing was going to be one of the ways that we could really look to eliminate some of the pinch points over time over the long pole with labor, by being more efficient with the way that we're able to manufacture the shell. So labor, I think continues to be the number one theme. What we are finding is that the labor wants to work. So as shelter in place, restrictions have been lifted more and more and using appropriate PPE and social distancing, we've been able to get homes built. There are additional requirements, I would tell you that it probably adds a few days in some places to cycle time, just because it's a little bit slower than what you'd maybe ideally like. So that might be a little bit of an added overlay constraint directly related to COVID. The other one is municipality. So, municipalities are typically fairly lean in inspectors and permit, their back office permitting facilitation. And so as those municipalities have sheltered in place, and they've asked their city and county employees to do the same, we have seen and experienced a bit of delay in our overall cycle time, just in our ability to get permits and get instructions.\nKenneth Zener: Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo.\nTruman Patterson: Hi, good morning guys. Nice results, and thank you for all the detail. There is a lot to digest there. So first question, big picture you're seeing some buyers exit, more densely populated urban areas, which metros or regions are you seeing as the most pronounced? And on top of that, are you actually seeing migration from a more densely populated regions, like the Northeast to less densely populated areas like the South? And just looking forward, how do you think this kind of plays out over the next year or two?\nRyan Marshall: Good morning, Truman; it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question. As far \u2013 I'll answer your second question first, as far as Northeast to the South, that's a trend that we've been experiencing for a long time. And so it's hard to suggest that it's any more than what it already was due to solve or housing affordability and a number of other things as some of the Southern States, I think have really worked to ramp up their job creation and create opportunities in the South. So I would suggest that, that continues to kind of happen and I wouldn't necessarily suggest that it's accelerating. As far as, the markets that we highlighted, where we are seeing an increase in our local business as a result of an urban exodus, if you will, I'll use that term loosely San Antonio, North Florida, Southwest Florida, which for us would be the Naples Fort Myers, Sarasota kind of West coast of Florida. And then we're also seeing a bit of it in the Northeast corridor, which is middle and Southern Jersey and in the Pennsylvania. So there, I think we are seeing some folks that maybe were living closer to the city, New York City that is looking for an opportunity to be a little bit more suburban in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. And then on your entry level, just some of your thoughts moving forward, you all have a \u2013 it seems like now you're making a bit more of an aggressive push towards the first time buyer entry-level segment. What portion of your business are you kind of targeting at this point? Is it primarily through expanding through your Centex brand nationwide? And it seems like everybody that makes us rotation it's really been actually a benefit to gross margin. Can you just talk about some of those moving parts for us?\nRyan Marshall: Sure, I'll take you on a bit of a time machine trip and go back to fall of 2016. We talked to the company that we felt that we had an opportunity to reposition our business to be a bit more balanced in the consumers that we target. And we laid out that ideally we wanted our first time buyer business to be about 35% of our business. What we highlighted was, is that we wanted to do it the right way and intentionally go out and buy parcels of the land that would allow us to be \u2013 to effectively and successfully and specifically target the first time buyer business. We've done that as is evidenced by the lots that we control currently for our first time buyer business equal 34% of the total lots we control are targeted to the first time by our business. And what we talked about is it would take some time from the time that we acquire and secure that land to where you see it coming through in the business. The most recent quarter, 31% of our closings represent \u2013 or were specifically targeted to the first time buyer, that compares to 32% of our closings in Q2 \u2013 I mean Q1. So we're \u2013 and then, compared to prior year\u2019s second quarter, we were 28%. So what you've seen is it's gone from our business being 26%, 27% first time to we're now in the 31%, 32%. And we're moving much closer to that ideal target of 35%. So we think it's done wonders for our business, we're seeing nice growth there, we're probably just a few percentage points shy of where we ideally want to be in terms of closing mix at this point in time, but we've got the land pipeline that will drive that.\nOperator: Next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys, good morning. Nice quarter and congrats on the execution during this difficult time. Ryan, just on that last point on the land pipeline, obviously you're starting to gradually ramp the acquisition and development back up again and presumably the land you're buying now is probably for maybe late 2021, 2022 deliveries, I would imagine at this point. But just trying to think forward here, you're in a difficult spot where you kind of do have to take a view on the sustainability of the trends we're seeing now, you could do certain things to mitigate the risks such as optioning more. But, when you look at 2021 and the pipeline you have, assuming this is sustainable. Do you foresee any air pockets on the supply side, thinking about the land pipeline primarily, where you would not be in a position to grow in 2021, assuming this kind of flurry of activity continues through the end of the year or do you think the pipeline is sufficient to continue growing through 2021?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We're not giving any guidance on 2021 at this point in time. What I will tell you just broadly about our land pipeline is it's healthy. We control over 160,000 lots. And to your point about how sustainable and how you can manage that risk with that forward view, it's a bigger reason that we've been driving toward the 50/50 mix on owned versus option. I'm really proud of what our team has been able to do and pushing that number to 46% options, which is the highest that we've ever seen in our business in over a decade. So that's a real win. And when we look at the lots that we've actually approved in the current year, the percentage of options are over 60%. So while we've moved the entire portfolio inclusive of Del Webb, when we isolate it just to 2020 acquisitions, we're north of 60%. So I think that's a big part of it. We've got a really big backlog, Alan, we're over 13,000 homes in backlog, 12% increase over prior year. So we're well positioned to not only deliver the next six months of the year, but that gives us a really nice kind of running start into early 2021 as well, which we think is a real advantage in kind of our build-to-order model is that it gives us so much forward visibility. And we know that it's a big part of what's continues to contribute to the outsize margins that our business is able to generate. We did highlight in Q1 and again, as part of kind of our land spend numbers in this quarter, we did we were cautious in the amount of land development dollars that we outlaid early in Q2. Certainly that will have a bit of impact on our ability to get new communities opened on the original timeline. We think that's a short-term kind of blip and it's not something that's going to materially impact our ability to continue to perform well.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That's helpful, Ryan. I appreciate that. And then second, you had some positive comments on Vegas earlier, and it's good to see that market continuing to or performing well in the face of a tough job environment there. As you look at the land spend for the back half of the year and your footprint, you have the benefit of being very well diversified. Are there any markets, thinking about Vegas or Orlando, maybe where you're going to be a little bit more conservative on land spend and perhaps reallocate those dollars elsewhere or do you feel like your whole portfolio right now has an equal look at land opportunities?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it's Bob. I think the simple answer to that is that all the markets are open. We are seeing positive demand trends across the country as Ryan walks you through. And so our view is until we see something change, we're willing and able to invest everywhere. You heard Ryan say that we're looking through with a little bit tighter lens. And, so as an example, for the things that we deferred 30 or 60 or 90 days ago, we have a new process that we've instituted where Jim Ossowski and the asset management team actually refreshes our expectations of market conditions. So at approval that got me for argument's sake, 10 months ago, waiting for some final entitlement. Before we move money, we're actually going back and saying, okay, did the pro formas that we built then do they still apply. And so I think, what I would characterize it is we're using the same discipline we always have. We've put one more hurdle in the purchase process. And that hurdle is applicable to every market. And so using Vegas or North Florida, in your example certainly, as Vegas has opened and improved our attitude towards it has gotten a little bit better. And so really we're looking at current on the ground data. We're listening to what the state regulators, governments are saying about shelter-in-place. And we think we're making educated investment decisions. So I don\u2019t know if that gets you all the way to where you want it to be, but in general, we're open for business, but we are being disciplined in that thought process.\nOperator: Next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much, guys. I'm really intrigued about the opportunity for you guys to raise prices. I know you said, you raised prices in more than half of your communities in one and a half year divisions. And I'm thinking that you've probably crossed over the absorption rate threshold in your communities and most of your communities by now, above which further growth lead you to raise price. We're also seeing mortgage rates down 80 basis points year-over-year. And so I'm thinking that the median monthly payment that your entry level buyer is paying is probably down quite a bit and probably down a lot more than the decline and they're seeing in rents. So I'm curious, when was the last time you think you saw buyer's monthly payments down this much versus rents. And is there any reason to think that there is going to, that's going to be provide you a lot of headroom to raise prices, in a way that is very different from what we've seen in the last few years?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, a tough question. There's a lot in that, I'll try and unpack it. And maybe easier than unpacking it is just to simply say, it's a really favorable demand environment out there. And I think as we highlighted, there's a number of factors that are driving that. One, money is very affordable right now. And so the prospect of being able to afford a new home is probably better than it's been a long time. I will caveat it by saying the first-time buyers still got to have a down payment. So there's got to be enough savings from somewhere in order to make that happen. And we don't see that being a huge impediment, but it is a restrictor out there that our hurdle rate or hurdle that needs to be cleared before the first-time buyer can enter the home buying market or the home ownership market. To your point, Stephen, I think it's not been often that the decline in interest rates and resulting payment has been faster than the decline in rent. And so you combine that with the fact that there's a desire to probably not live in more densely constructed apartment type complexes. I think those are really positive tailwinds for the entire industry. And certainly, as we move our business closer to 35%, being first time, we think that bodes well for the future of the business.\nStephen Kim: Yes, it certainly does. My follow-up relates to the down payment comment that you made. Historically, you're right, down payment has been viewed as like one of the key impediments to first-time buyers. But I'm thinking in this environment, we've seen student loan forbearance through from March to September. We found that the average payment on that student debt is nearly $400 a month. If you take a couple with \u2013 that both may have student loans, I mean, ramp it out or grow it through September plus a couple of $1,200 stimulus checks. I mean, that alone can pretty much match go a long way towards providing the down payment. So I'm curious as to whether or not you are hearing from the folks in your communities, the sales folks that the ability to come up with a down payment is not the hurdle that it once was. And in fact, that hurdle may actually be getting lower given the increased savings.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, I don't know that we've specifically heard direct feedback on down payment related concerns that there's anything there that I would highlight. What I would tell you is evidenced by the year-over-year growth rate that we highlighted in our June sales from the first-time segment. We were up 70%, 70-plus percent in the first-time buyer segment. So if you use that as a data point, it wouldn't largely suggest that those buyers are able and are finding ways to come up with a down payment, whether it's from the means that you suggested or something else, the money is clearly there and that's translating into a favorable sales environment out of that segment.\nOperator: Next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Susan.\nSusan Maklari: My first question is, can you give us a little bit more color on the SG&A side, especially as it sounds like you have taken back some of those people that you've furloughed and perhaps we're even adding to the headcount from some of the more permanent reductions that you did. How should we think about that flowing through? And can you give us some sense of where you are in terms of the headcount?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. Sure, Susan. I think if you kind of piece together everything that we included in the remarks, because the business has been strong, we have brought back almost all of the furloughed folks that we had asked to wait to come back to work. We've even rehired a couple of people but on balance, we had announced about $65 million worth of save in fiscal 2020 related to the actions that we took. And I would tell you that remains pretty much where we think we landed. We may reintroduce a couple of costs and principally I'm thinking on the IT side, to make sure we continue to advance that work beyond where we thought we would, based on the work we did in May. So with that, our spend is pretty much what we thought it was going to be that is reflected in the guide that we gave. So if you think about it, our full year guide at 10.3% to 10.7% of revenues in SG&A is better than by about 20 basis points, the guide that we had at the beginning of the year which we obviously took down at the beginning of the pandemic. So we don't see a lot of creep back into the business, which is good. And we want to be disciplined about that. We hadn't included the furloughed folks in the save. And so we had hoped and expected to bring those folks back to work. They've come back, to Ryan's point, they're mostly field personnel, so they're serving revenue producing activities. So we feel pretty good about our expense structure for where we are in the business. And if the business continues to perform at a heightened level, we might need to bring some more people back. But again, I think that would be well leveraged from an overhead perspective, because they would be bringing \u2013 we would be bringing them back to do things once again that are revenue producing.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then, given the trends that we've seen and obviously, the relative confidence in your outlook, can you just talk a bit to what you need to see to get comfortable, to start to resume some of the repurchase activity and any color on what the timing of that could potentially be?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. So I think in fairness, we've come through a pretty tough time. We fully drew our revolver. We were able to pay that back comfortably. We have a very nice cash position, debt-to-cap is at 32% and a year ago it was at 35%. So we've made progress there. If you look at it on a net basis, it's a 15.5% down from 29% a year ago. So feel really good about our financial position. Having said that, we're still in the midst of a pandemic and so I think what we will do is very consistent with what we've done historically is we'll report the news. So as and when we get into the market after we've done that, you'll hear about it. But the process will be, Ryan and I, and the team here will work through, what are our medium to longer term capital needs? What do we think the business produces no different than pre-pandemic, share and work through that with the board and come up with a game plan for how to repurchase equity. You heard Ryan say it earlier in the call, our capital priorities have not changed. It's still invested in the business at high return, it's pay our dividend and if we have extra, we will use it to buy back stock. We also talked about leverage. We're in a good spot there. We do have a maturity in March of next year, $420-some-odd million. That will be something that we would likely at this point think that we're going to use cash to satisfy. But obviously market conditions needs for cash and capital will weigh on that as we get closer. So we'll have more to say about that as time goes by.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.\nJay McCanless: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, the first question I had is could you give us any color on where you expect community growth for the rest of this year and maybe a hint or a preview for 2021?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so community count growth we are thinking is going to be somewhere from between 2% and 4% down in Q3 and Q4 each versus the average in the preceding year quarter. So Q3 versus Q3 of the year prior, certainly the development delays and the land purchase delays. You heard Ryan talk about it earlier in the call, that come from what we did, call it beginning of April through the middle to late June. We've started to ramp that back up but that will have an impact on our community count as we go forward. We have not provided any guidance for fiscal 2021. We'll give you that as we get closer to the end of the year and we go through our planning process.\nJay McCanless: That's helpful. Thank you for that. The second question I had in terms of what you're looking for, for new land acquisition and some of the migration away from the urban core, you guys talked about. I mean, is Pulte as a company starting to look at further out land positions, larger land positions, more lots, I mean, has COVID and everything we've seen over the last four months affected the way you guys are buying land or thinking about land going forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Jay, this is Ryan. I think what we highlighted is that the process that we've used to evaluate risk associated with buying land remains very consistent. So we have not made major changes there. Certainly, I do think the changes in consumer behavior from COVID that will clearly influence things over time. I think some of the bigger influences are going to be on home design, quite frankly. But our business always has been somewhat or mostly suburban, just because that's where available land is. So as far as going into the exurbs and into B and C type locations and really making big bets on land, I don't know that you should expect to see that from us. We're going to continue to be very disciplined in where we invest. We still think that access to transportation corridors, good schools, employment, entertainment, shopping, et cetera. We still think those things all matter. And so we're going to continue to look at buying in locations where we think buyers want to be, pre-COVID, post-COVID. And those are the elements that we think drive through-cycle return.\nJay McCanless: Do you think that and from a plan standpoint, you guys are in good shape or are you seeing a lot more requests for the double work from home or the students and the kids working from home environment, are you guys adapting to that? And what are you hearing from your customers right now, as far as that goes, if you're not going to go further out, maybe talk about what you're going to do with some of the house plans, et cetera?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So Jay, I think it's one of the things that's been a real strength for the company is our consumer inspired focus and the research that we've been doing for the past seven or eight years with our commonly managed plans. We've really been designing and creating just some spectacular floor plans that not only I think meet current consumer needs, they allow for great flexibility. So in our build-to-order model, there are a number of things where we have flexible spaces that can be turned into a gym or a home office or a second master or an in-law suite. Those are all things that our current portfolio of plans allow for. We'll continue to listen to the customer, especially in light of what's currently changing to see if there's more opportunity to accelerate that. But keep in mind, what I highlighted early in the call, our biggest competitor is resale. And I can promise you that any of the new plans that we have are far better than housing stock that's 10, 20, 30 years old.\nOperator: At this time, I'll turn the call over to the presenters.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll be available for questions over the remainder of the day, and we'll look forward to speaking with you on the next call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks Jim, and good morning. I am very pleased to report that the recovery in new home demand that we experienced over the course of the second quarter was nothing short of outstanding. Our second quarter results show a remarkable rebound in demand as April net new orders fell 53% from last year, only to see year-over-year orders increased 50% for the month of June. Led by strong demand among first-time buyers, we saw meaningful improvement across all buyer groups and geographies as the quarter advanced. This improvement culminated in June orders increasing 77% for first time, 48% for move up and 21% for active adult over June of last year. The rebound in demand during the quarter resulted in our aggregate second quarter orders declining only 4% from last year. We are very encouraged by the fact that the momentum of this dramatic recovery continues as demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of July. Improving industry dynamics in combination with disciplined business practices allowed us to drive meaningful gains in our operating results and financial position. These gains include revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved overhead leverage, which when coupled with our prudent financial planning, and strong cash generation, leave us in the position of strength as we work through the balance of the year. For all the positive dynamics we are experiencing in our business. It's clear that COVID-19 continues to act a severe toll on the economy, and more importantly, the people of our country. It goes beyond any business implications, but simply as human beings, one cannot look at the ongoing health impacts and loss of life and see it as anything but a tragic situation. With this as a backdrop, it is our heartfelt hope that everyone on this call, your families as well as our employees, trade partners and the communities we serve remain healthy and safe. From our health officials to our front-line workers, to pharmaceutical companies, the efforts to battle this virus has been heroic. Before we get into discussing our second quarter financial results, let me provide a brief update on the impacts of the pandemic and insights on how we are running the business currently. At the outset of the pandemic, we closed our sales centers and model homes and quickly pivoted to working remotely and selling virtually. I am pleased to say that we began reopening our sales centers and models in early May. And we are now fully open and staff to work with our walk-in and by appointment customers. As you would expect, our salespeople are using appropriate PPE, are adhering to social distancing practices and are following enhanced cleaning and disinfecting processes to help protect the health of our employees and customers. While our sales centers are open, we are interacting with customers on their preferred terms because not everyone is comfortable with in-person meetings. We continue to take full advantage of available technology and tools that have successfully supported our efforts to sell homes virtually. Except for a handful of markets, home building was deemed an essential service from the start of COVID-19. So disruptions to our construction operations were minor even during the early stages of the pandemic. At present, our operations are fully functional in all markets across the country. Again, in partnership with our trades, we are using appropriate PPE and are adhering to social distancing practices to protect workers on the job site and in the homes. And finally, our financial services group truly did an outstanding job, adjusting their business model to work remotely and handle every aspect of the mortgage and closing processes virtually. At present, personnel are still working off-site, but as demonstrated by the strong second quarter financial results and high capture rate, the team continues to perform at a very high level. Thanks to the tremendous effort of our purchasing team, working in conjunction with our suppliers. Our supply chain has held up well with minimal disruptions to our home building operations. Working closely with sales and construction, our purchasing group has been able to navigate around potential shortages and ensure ongoing availability of key building products. Given the rebound in housing, we have been increasing our land acquisition and development spend, this primarily relates to land deals where we negotiated purchase delays of anywhere from 30 to 90 days. We are now completing most of these transactions when the new closing date arrives. Unfortunately, it's clear that COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon. So we remain disciplined and thoughtful in our land investments. This includes increasing our use of options, which now account for 46% of the lots that we control. On the people side, I am very pleased to say that improved market dynamics have allowed us to bring back the majority of the employees that we furloughed during the quarter. We have also had the opportunity to rehire a small number of the people we released in May, which is a good feeling. I would note that most of the individuals returning to our organization are in the field construction roles. Obviously, the demand for new homes has experienced a dramatic rebound over the past eight to 10 weeks, following the initial shock from COVID-19. While housing demand certainly continues to benefit from historically low interest rates, analyzing the drivers of demand suggests there are likely additional factors that work as well. First, looking at the number of internet searches related to home buying, the data indicate that there has been an increase in consumer interest in homes. Particularly new homes, utilizing available Google trends data, we can view patterns for specific search terms commonly associated with buying a new home. Despite the overlay of COVID-19 searches for new home related terms has been growing since mid-March. In fact, we have routinely seen multi-year highs in the number of searches related to shopping for a new home. I would note that we have seen a similar pattern in terms of Google searches for Del Webb, which are up dramatically in May and June. In fact, unique visitors to our Del Webb site are now approaching 70,000 per week and are trending higher than they were at this time last year. Second, while we can debate the magnitude, ZIP code level analysis on buying patterns points to a movement of renters and homeowners from urban centers into the surrounding suburbs. Based on an internal survey, roughly half of our division presidents report that their business has experienced a modest increase in demand from urban buyers, while several of our divisions referenced a material increase in such demand. And finally, we see the third and possibly largest driver of demand for new homes being the very limited supply of existing housing stock available today. At the end of May, the total housing inventory was 1.55 million units, which was down 19% from the prior year. I'm sure we can all appreciate that it's hard to be comfortable opening your home to strangers during a global pandemic. The strong demand has also helped to absorb some of the spec inventory, which had built up in the system in March and April. Data show that in markets where we operate the number of quick-move-in homes available for sale fell by 16% from the end of March through the end of June, a lot has been made about the advantage of having spec units available. But the draw down in supply and a build cycle of less than 80 days for a first-time buyer product allows our build-to-order model to compete very effectively and with less risk. The combination of strong demand and limited inventory has also allowed us to raise prices across many of our communities. In fact, more than half of our divisions report raising prices in 50% or more of their communities. The typical price increase is in the range of 1% to 3% and includes changes in base price and/or reductions in incentives. The positive change in market dynamics from April to the end of June has been dramatic and gives us greater confidence about the business moving forward. As such, we are reestablishing guidance for the remainder of 2020, which Bob will provide as part of his review of our second quarter results. In this regard, I want to say that the volatility caused by the pandemic is unlike anything this industry has experienced, even during the worst of the Great Recession. The swings in demand during the second quarter alone were fast and severe, buyer demand is clearly experienced a dramatic recovery in the quarter and has remained strong through the first three weeks of July. That being said, COVID hotspots continue to grow in size and number, which in turn is slowing down the reopening of state and local economies. It is impossible to forecast how these dynamics will unfold in the coming weeks and months. For PulteGroup, we will be optimistic about future market conditions that remain very disciplined and measured in how we manage our business. Now, let me turn the call to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Bob? Operating in the midst of a global pandemic and extreme market volatility, the company delivered an outstanding quarterly earnings performance, while generating strong cash flows that further strengthened our financial position and flexibility. I want to say that we are certainly encouraged by the rebound and acceleration in demand that we've experienced over the past few months. While there are different thoughts on the drivers of this demand, what is clear is that the desire for home ownership remains high for all buyer groups, whether it's the first time buyer looking to exit a shared living space or the active adult buyer looking for a new adventure, people want a place to call their own. That being said, we continue to monitor the acceleration of COVID-19 cases in cities across the country, along with delays and even step backs in the reopening of local economies. Given these conditions, we remain committed to taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach to running our business. While we have had to adjust business practices, our fundamental goals and strategies have not changed, as we continue to focus on generating high returns through time. This means allocating capital and alignment with our stated priorities of investing in the business, paying our dividend and when appropriate returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases. This also means operating against the same risk weighted criteria that we have used so successfully to invest in land for the past eight years. Although, given today's environment, we are certainly working to assess any elevated risks associated with operating during a global pandemic. I want to thank all of our teams from our corporate and division offices to our frontline field personnel for their tremendous efforts during these very challenging times, everyone has pulled together as we transitioned our operations to work remotely and then where appropriate moved back on site as sales centers could reopen and markets exited their lockdowns. From implementing new technologies and virtual selling strategies, we're using PPE and appropriate social distancing, our people have done smart, fast, resilient and maybe most of all invested in each other and in our company. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Well, John it's Ryan and good morning, thanks for the question. We're monitoring all the same metrics that we typically monitor when we run the business. So we're looking at what's going on with consumer behavior, what are we seeing the desire for home ownership, what's happening in a new home searches on the internet, some of the things that we described in our prepared remarks. We clearly pay attention to what's happening in the resale market, which still to this day remains our biggest competitor. Certainly we have new home competitors, but with the majority of home sales being dominated by resale, we certainly pay attention to what's happening there. We look at what's happening in the job market with unemployment, with job creation, et cetera. So we're really focused, John, the biggest thing that I would emphasize is we're focused on delivering high returns through time. And so while we certainly have got a little bit of a tailwind at our back right now with consumer demand, the investments that we're making, the way that we're running the company, the way that we're managing debt, the way that we're managing cash, we're very much focused on those being through cycle type you movements. The other thing, I think in the more kind of short-term that we've got to pay attention to is state, shelter in place orders, and what might potentially happen as local economies may revert back to Phase 1, Phase 2, et cetera, certainly that could have an impact on the kind of shorter-term demand that we might see in a sales office. Yes. Surprisingly John, if you remember, at the end of the first quarter call, I highlighted Vegas as a market that we were quite concerned about given the dominance of tourism and travel related economy. That market has performed incredibly well, and in fact had a spectacular June. So with the reopening of the casinos, even at a limited capacity, we've seen a lot of the local workers go back to work. And folks are back in the casinos and staying at the hotels. So our Vegas business did quite well in June, and we're very happy about that. Thanks, John. Yes, Chris. It's the same process that we've always used, which is we evaluated on a community-by-community basis, taking into consideration what's happening in the local resale market that we compete against as well as what we're doing in our competitive efforts against our other new home competitors. Those are the things that really influence, what's going on in our pricing decisions. We're certainly focused on driving the best through cycle returns that we can. And so, that continues to be the overarching theme and umbrella that we use to make decisions. I would remind you that, you need to really pay attention to rent as well, especially with our first time buyer business that is an alternative source of shelter for that consumer. And so they're going to constantly look at the economics of what's more advantageous. So while demand is good, we don't believe that you can raise prices in an unfettered work. Yes. So those markets have been incredibly strong for us, Chris. The three that you highlighted Arizona, particularly Phoenix, Texas and Florida, not only are they hot in temperature right now, they're also hot in terms of sales pace. So despite the fact that there has been an increase in COVID cases in those markets, they have been some of the most aggressive in reopening the local economies. And we've certainly seen that translate in success in our sales offices as well. Thanks, Mike. Yes Mike, good morning and thanks for the question. June was a spectacular month and we're very pleased with that. To your point, I do think there was some pent up demand for a lot of the reasons that we listed in our prepared remarks and some of the things that you've highlighted. So to assume that growth rates like that would continue forward, that's \u2013 the time will tell. What I will tell you about July and we're not going to deviate from our traditional practice other than to comment on the how the first three or so weeks of July have been. The first three weeks in July had continued to be strong, albeit on a somewhat seasonally adjusted basis as we go into the kind of dog days of summer. So we're very happy with how July has performed, we're optimistic about kind of what the summer selling months will hold for our business. But we'll stop short of kind of providing a full forecast for the third quarter. Hi, Ken. Good morning, Ken and thanks for the question. When we think about production constraints, it's \u2013 the number one continues to be labor, which is not a new theme, the entire industry has talked about that for a long time. And it's one of the big reasons that we made the acquisition of ICG down in Jacksonville earlier in the years, we felt that moving to more offsite type manufacturing was going to be one of the ways that we could really look to eliminate some of the pinch points over time over the long pole with labor, by being more efficient with the way that we're able to manufacture the shell. So labor, I think continues to be the number one theme. What we are finding is that the labor wants to work. So as shelter in place, restrictions have been lifted more and more and using appropriate PPE and social distancing, we've been able to get homes built. There are additional requirements, I would tell you that it probably adds a few days in some places to cycle time, just because it's a little bit slower than what you'd maybe ideally like. So that might be a little bit of an added overlay constraint directly related to COVID. The other one is municipality. So, municipalities are typically fairly lean in inspectors and permit, their back office permitting facilitation. And so as those municipalities have sheltered in place, and they've asked their city and county employees to do the same, we have seen and experienced a bit of delay in our overall cycle time, just in our ability to get permits and get instructions. Thanks, Ken. Good morning, Truman; it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. As far \u2013 I'll answer your second question first, as far as Northeast to the South, that's a trend that we've been experiencing for a long time. And so it's hard to suggest that it's any more than what it already was due to solve or housing affordability and a number of other things as some of the Southern States, I think have really worked to ramp up their job creation and create opportunities in the South. So I would suggest that, that continues to kind of happen and I wouldn't necessarily suggest that it's accelerating. As far as, the markets that we highlighted, where we are seeing an increase in our local business as a result of an urban exodus, if you will, I'll use that term loosely San Antonio, North Florida, Southwest Florida, which for us would be the Naples Fort Myers, Sarasota kind of West coast of Florida. And then we're also seeing a bit of it in the Northeast corridor, which is middle and Southern Jersey and in the Pennsylvania. So there, I think we are seeing some folks that maybe were living closer to the city, New York City that is looking for an opportunity to be a little bit more suburban in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Sure, I'll take you on a bit of a time machine trip and go back to fall of 2016. We talked to the company that we felt that we had an opportunity to reposition our business to be a bit more balanced in the consumers that we target. And we laid out that ideally we wanted our first time buyer business to be about 35% of our business. What we highlighted was, is that we wanted to do it the right way and intentionally go out and buy parcels of the land that would allow us to be \u2013 to effectively and successfully and specifically target the first time buyer business. We've done that as is evidenced by the lots that we control currently for our first time buyer business equal 34% of the total lots we control are targeted to the first time by our business. And what we talked about is it would take some time from the time that we acquire and secure that land to where you see it coming through in the business. The most recent quarter, 31% of our closings represent \u2013 or were specifically targeted to the first time buyer, that compares to 32% of our closings in Q2 \u2013 I mean Q1. So we're \u2013 and then, compared to prior year's second quarter, we were 28%. So what you've seen is it's gone from our business being 26%, 27% first time to we're now in the 31%, 32%. And we're moving much closer to that ideal target of 35%. So we think it's done wonders for our business, we're seeing nice growth there, we're probably just a few percentage points shy of where we ideally want to be in terms of closing mix at this point in time, but we've got the land pipeline that will drive that. Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We're not giving any guidance on 2021 at this point in time. What I will tell you just broadly about our land pipeline is it's healthy. We control over 160,000 lots. And to your point about how sustainable and how you can manage that risk with that forward view, it's a bigger reason that we've been driving toward the 50/50 mix on owned versus option. I'm really proud of what our team has been able to do and pushing that number to 46% options, which is the highest that we've ever seen in our business in over a decade. So that's a real win. And when we look at the lots that we've actually approved in the current year, the percentage of options are over 60%. So while we've moved the entire portfolio inclusive of Del Webb, when we isolate it just to 2020 acquisitions, we're north of 60%. So I think that's a big part of it. We've got a really big backlog, Alan, we're over 13,000 homes in backlog, 12% increase over prior year. So we're well positioned to not only deliver the next six months of the year, but that gives us a really nice kind of running start into early 2021 as well, which we think is a real advantage in kind of our build-to-order model is that it gives us so much forward visibility. And we know that it's a big part of what's continues to contribute to the outsize margins that our business is able to generate. We did highlight in Q1 and again, as part of kind of our land spend numbers in this quarter, we did we were cautious in the amount of land development dollars that we outlaid early in Q2. Certainly that will have a bit of impact on our ability to get new communities opened on the original timeline. We think that's a short-term kind of blip and it's not something that's going to materially impact our ability to continue to perform well. Yes, Stephen, a tough question. There's a lot in that, I'll try and unpack it. And maybe easier than unpacking it is just to simply say, it's a really favorable demand environment out there. And I think as we highlighted, there's a number of factors that are driving that. One, money is very affordable right now. And so the prospect of being able to afford a new home is probably better than it's been a long time. I will caveat it by saying the first-time buyers still got to have a down payment. So there's got to be enough savings from somewhere in order to make that happen. And we don't see that being a huge impediment, but it is a restrictor out there that our hurdle rate or hurdle that needs to be cleared before the first-time buyer can enter the home buying market or the home ownership market. To your point, Stephen, I think it's not been often that the decline in interest rates and resulting payment has been faster than the decline in rent. And so you combine that with the fact that there's a desire to probably not live in more densely constructed apartment type complexes. I think those are really positive tailwinds for the entire industry. And certainly, as we move our business closer to 35%, being first time, we think that bodes well for the future of the business. Yes, Stephen, I don't know that we've specifically heard direct feedback on down payment related concerns that there's anything there that I would highlight. What I would tell you is evidenced by the year-over-year growth rate that we highlighted in our June sales from the first-time segment. We were up 70%, 70-plus percent in the first-time buyer segment. So if you use that as a data point, it wouldn't largely suggest that those buyers are able and are finding ways to come up with a down payment, whether it's from the means that you suggested or something else, the money is clearly there and that's translating into a favorable sales environment out of that segment. Hi, Susan. Yes, Jay, this is Ryan. I think what we highlighted is that the process that we've used to evaluate risk associated with buying land remains very consistent. So we have not made major changes there. Certainly, I do think the changes in consumer behavior from COVID that will clearly influence things over time. I think some of the bigger influences are going to be on home design, quite frankly. But our business always has been somewhat or mostly suburban, just because that's where available land is. So as far as going into the exurbs and into B and C type locations and really making big bets on land, I don't know that you should expect to see that from us. We're going to continue to be very disciplined in where we invest. We still think that access to transportation corridors, good schools, employment, entertainment, shopping, et cetera. We still think those things all matter. And so we're going to continue to look at buying in locations where we think buyers want to be, pre-COVID, post-COVID. And those are the elements that we think drive through-cycle return. Yes. So Jay, I think it's one of the things that's been a real strength for the company is our consumer inspired focus and the research that we've been doing for the past seven or eight years with our commonly managed plans. We've really been designing and creating just some spectacular floor plans that not only I think meet current consumer needs, they allow for great flexibility. So in our build-to-order model, there are a number of things where we have flexible spaces that can be turned into a gym or a home office or a second master or an in-law suite. Those are all things that our current portfolio of plans allow for. We'll continue to listen to the customer, especially in light of what's currently changing to see if there's more opportunity to accelerate that. But keep in mind, what I highlighted early in the call, our biggest competitor is resale. And I can promise you that any of the new plans that we have are far better than housing stock that's 10, 20, 30 years old."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Similar to our first quarter call, I won't go through our typical detailed analysis of our income statement and balance sheet, but I'll talk about the business in the context of COVID-19. Also given the volatility in market conditions during the quarter, where needed, I will provide some insights on the change in our business as the quarter progressed. And finally, as Ryan stated, we will be providing guidance on our expected third quarter and full year 2020 results. For our second quarter, wholesale revenues increased 3% to $2.5 billion, the higher revenues in the period were driven by a 6% increase in closings to 5,937 homes, partially offset by a 3% decrease in average sales price to $416,000. Consistent with recent trends, the lower average sales price primarily reflects changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed. I would highlight that these changes were exaggerated in the quarter as the pandemic caused temporary market shutdowns in several higher price locations, including Northern California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and the State of Washington. Closings for the quarter consisted of 31% first time, 44% move up and 25% active adult. This compares with prior year closings of 28% first time, 46% move up and 26% active adult. Net new orders for the second quarter, totaled 6,522 homes, which is down 4% from last year, given that we started the quarter with April orders down 53% from the prior year, this represents a tremendous turnaround in demand. For the entire quarter, first time orders were up 17% to 2,327 homes, move up orders were down 7% to 2,873 homes and active adult orders were down 22% to 1,322 homes. We've gotten questions over the quarter about how active adult buyers are behaving. So I want to note that demand among this group improved in each month to two quarter. In fact, June orders were up 21% over last year with active adult buyers more comfortable going out and with the amenities now reopened in our communities, the buying and selling process is feeling more routine. At the same time, active adult buyers are finding a strong demand environment that they have to sell an existing home, so we are optimistic that an ongoing recovery in this part of our business. For the quarter, our cancellation rate was 19% compared with 14% last year, the higher cancellation rate was driven by elevated cancellations in April, as the cancellation rate felt only 12% of our orders in June. As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, we have seen that buyers are excited to close. We ended the second quarter with 13,214 homes in backlog, which is an increase of 12% over last year. At the end of the quarter, we had 10,946 homes under construction, which is down 4% from last year. But the homes currently in production, 2,121 or 19% were specs. In aggregate, the lower number of homes under construction is consistent with our decision to tightly manage starts as demand collapsed early in the pandemic, while we are focused on building sold homes, we have started to increase the number of speculative starts in an effort to get us closer to our target ratio of specs, representing approximately 25% to 30% of units in production. Based on our backlog and the number of units in production, we currently expect to deliver between 6,000 and 6,300 homes in the third quarter, further, we now expect deliveries for the full year to be in the range of 23,500 to 24,000 homes, with an average price and backlog of approximately $438,000, we expect third quarter ASP to be in the range of $425,000 to $435,000. For the full year, we expect average sales price on deliveries to be between $420,000 and $430,000. As always, the mix of deliveries will influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Back to my review of our second quarter results, gross margin for the quarter was 23.9%, which represents an increase of 80 basis points over last year and a sequential gain of 20 basis points from the first quarter. Margins in the quarter benefited from the strong sales environment in the back half of 2019, when the majority of these homes were sold. Our margins also reflect lower incentives, as sales discounts were down 40 basis points from last year to 3.5% and down 10 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Given today's favorable demand conditions, we expect gross margins to remain strong through the back half of the year. Currently, we expect gross margin for the third quarter to be in the range of 23.9%, 24.2% with full year gross margin to be in the range of 23.8%, 24.1%. Our reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $197 million or 8% of home sale revenues included in our reported SG&A was a $61 million pre-tax benefit, resulting from the reversal of an insurance reserve partially offset by the previously announced $10 million pre-tax charge or severance resulting from staffing actions taken in the quarter. Excluding these two items, our adjusted SG&A expense for the quarter was $247 million or 10% of home sale revenues, which is 80 basis points better than in the second quarter of last year. The improvement in overhead leverage was driven by the volume growth realized in the quarter, along with the actions taken to lower overhead expenses in response to changing market conditions. While we typically give guidance only for full year SG&A expenditures, we are providing Q3 numbers as well. We currently expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.4% of revenues for the third quarter and our adjusted SG&A to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7% of revenues for the full year. Turning to financial services, our operations generated $60 million of pre-tax income, representing an outstanding 141% increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by an improved margin environment, higher loan volumes resulting from growth in the company's home building operations and a higher capture rate. In fact, our mortgage capture rate for the second quarter increased to 87% from 81% last year. The improved capture rate reflects the opportunity our home building operations are finding to leverage Pulte Mortgage in providing value-added services to our customers. The investments our financial services team have made in building their technology platform allowed them to transition to offsite operations with virtual processing without missing a beat. Closing out my comments on our income statement, our second quarter income tax expense was $108 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. This compares to tax expense of $80 million for an effective rate of 24.9% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than last year and our historic guidance, primarily because of energy tax credits realized in the periods. Going forward, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any discrete permanent differences like the energy tax credits that may arise. Our reported net income for the second quarter was $349 million or $1.29 per share, while our adjusted net income was $311 million or $1.15 per share. Prior year net income for the period was $241 million or $0.86 per share. Moving over to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash, after having repaid the $700 million we drew down from our revolving credit facility in March. In addition to our strong operating results, our second quarter cash position benefited from our actions to strategically defer investments in land and vertical construction costs, as well as our decision to suspend our share repurchase activities. Having repaid the revolver, we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 32.1%, while our net debt to capital ratio felt a 15.5%. In the second quarter, we invested $452 million in land acquisition and developments, which is down from $619 million in Q1 of this year and $857 million in the second quarter of last year. I would note that last year spend included $136 million related to the American West acquisition. Through the first six months of 2020, we have invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and related development. Given the improving market conditions, we are increasing our investment in both land development and the purchase of new land assets. As such, we expect our full year land investment will be approximately $2.7 billion, as we begin completing land deals that we previously deferred. I'd like to highlight that the pandemic and any material impact it has on housing demand or the consumer and the broader economy could influence how much capital we ultimately invest. We ended the quarter with 163,000 lots under control, of which 46% are options. This represents our highest option position in over a decade, as we continue to progress toward our target of 50% owned and 50% options. Let me now turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments, Ryan? Yes. Hey Mike, it's Bob and a fair question. Certainly lumber has trended to candidly all time highs. We've given a guide on our margins for the balance of the year. And I think most folks are familiar with the way we purchased lumber, it's on a trailing 13 week basis. And so our lumber package pricing for the balance of the year is pretty much set. So these increases will really be more of an impact in 2021, depending on how the market, the lumber market performs over the next three to six weeks, 12 weeks. So on balance, actually the market is pretty good for commodities, lumber being an outlier. And I think most builders were able to try and work with their trades to drive pricing down, we'll see some benefit for that, that's incorporated into our guide for the balance of the year twice you see margin improving as we continue through the year. Given the pretty quick ramp up in the business, I think it's reasonable to expect that the trades will be looking for some of that money back as time goes by. In a world where we can get some modest price increases that's to your point, usually sufficient for us to offset it those potential increases in costs. So we're not giving a guide on margin beyond 2020, but you can tell from the guide for the balance of the year, which is up from where we were in Q3, which is \u2013 sorry, Q2, which was up from Q1 and up a lot from last year that the market is pretty good. And so we are always conscious of overall affordability to Ryan's point, rent is always the biggest competitor and\\or resale, but we feel pretty good about our pricing opportunities and our cost controls today. Hi, Ken. Yes, Alan, it's Bob. I think the simple answer to that is that all the markets are open. We are seeing positive demand trends across the country as Ryan walks you through. And so our view is until we see something change, we're willing and able to invest everywhere. You heard Ryan say that we're looking through with a little bit tighter lens. And, so as an example, for the things that we deferred 30 or 60 or 90 days ago, we have a new process that we've instituted where Jim Ossowski and the asset management team actually refreshes our expectations of market conditions. So at approval that got me for argument's sake, 10 months ago, waiting for some final entitlement. Before we move money, we're actually going back and saying, okay, did the pro formas that we built then do they still apply. And so I think, what I would characterize it is we're using the same discipline we always have. We've put one more hurdle in the purchase process. And that hurdle is applicable to every market. And so using Vegas or North Florida, in your example certainly, as Vegas has opened and improved our attitude towards it has gotten a little bit better. And so really we're looking at current on the ground data. We're listening to what the state regulators, governments are saying about shelter-in-place. And we think we're making educated investment decisions. So I don't know if that gets you all the way to where you want it to be, but in general, we're open for business, but we are being disciplined in that thought process. Yes. Sure, Susan. I think if you kind of piece together everything that we included in the remarks, because the business has been strong, we have brought back almost all of the furloughed folks that we had asked to wait to come back to work. We've even rehired a couple of people but on balance, we had announced about $65 million worth of save in fiscal 2020 related to the actions that we took. And I would tell you that remains pretty much where we think we landed. We may reintroduce a couple of costs and principally I'm thinking on the IT side, to make sure we continue to advance that work beyond where we thought we would, based on the work we did in May. So with that, our spend is pretty much what we thought it was going to be that is reflected in the guide that we gave. So if you think about it, our full year guide at 10.3% to 10.7% of revenues in SG&A is better than by about 20 basis points, the guide that we had at the beginning of the year which we obviously took down at the beginning of the pandemic. So we don't see a lot of creep back into the business, which is good. And we want to be disciplined about that. We hadn't included the furloughed folks in the save. And so we had hoped and expected to bring those folks back to work. They've come back, to Ryan's point, they're mostly field personnel, so they're serving revenue producing activities. So we feel pretty good about our expense structure for where we are in the business. And if the business continues to perform at a heightened level, we might need to bring some more people back. But again, I think that would be well leveraged from an overhead perspective, because they would be bringing \u2013 we would be bringing them back to do things once again that are revenue producing. Yes. So I think in fairness, we've come through a pretty tough time. We fully drew our revolver. We were able to pay that back comfortably. We have a very nice cash position, debt-to-cap is at 32% and a year ago it was at 35%. So we've made progress there. If you look at it on a net basis, it's a 15.5% down from 29% a year ago. So feel really good about our financial position. Having said that, we're still in the midst of a pandemic and so I think what we will do is very consistent with what we've done historically is we'll report the news. So as and when we get into the market after we've done that, you'll hear about it. But the process will be, Ryan and I, and the team here will work through, what are our medium to longer term capital needs? What do we think the business produces no different than pre-pandemic, share and work through that with the board and come up with a game plan for how to repurchase equity. You heard Ryan say it earlier in the call, our capital priorities have not changed. It's still invested in the business at high return, it's pay our dividend and if we have extra, we will use it to buy back stock. We also talked about leverage. We're in a good spot there. We do have a maturity in March of next year, $420-some-odd million. That will be something that we would likely at this point think that we're going to use cash to satisfy. But obviously market conditions needs for cash and capital will weigh on that as we get closer. So we'll have more to say about that as time goes by. Yes, so community count growth we are thinking is going to be somewhere from between 2% and 4% down in Q3 and Q4 each versus the average in the preceding year quarter. So Q3 versus Q3 of the year prior, certainly the development delays and the land purchase delays. You heard Ryan talk about it earlier in the call, that come from what we did, call it beginning of April through the middle to late June. We've started to ramp that back up but that will have an impact on our community count as we go forward. We have not provided any guidance for fiscal 2021. We'll give you that as we get closer to the end of the year and we go through our planning process."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session  [Operator instructions]. I will now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead Sir.\nJim Zeumer: Thank you, Joanne and good morning. I want to welcome you to PulteGroup's first quarter earnings call but sadly most of the conversations will be about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, I certainly hope that you are all well and staying safe. Today's call is a little different given we have PulteGroup participants located in number of locations. So I apologize in advance for any technical difficulties we may encounter. Joining me here and in appropriate social distance are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Joining us remotely are Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. And I am pleased to welcome Debra Still, President and CEO of PulteGroup Financial Service, who is dialing in from Denver. We thought it would be helpful to have Debra available to answer questions about our mortgage operations and overall mortgage market conditions. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides that accompanies today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of today's call to our website a little later. Before I turn the call over to Ryan, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Jim and good morning. Before I begin let me offer my thoughts and prayers to everyone on the call today and in the communities in which PulteGroup operates. I sincerely hope that you and your families are well and are managing through the challenges created by COVID-19. I also want to acknowledge and say thank you to our nation's healthcare workers and first responders who have been remarkable in fighting the onsite of this disease. Given the devastating effects COVID-19 has had across the country I am going to focus my comments on the company's specific impacts and our operational responses. Bob will then discuss some of the key numbers within our first quarter results. As well as some factors to consider as you think about our business going forward. COVID-19, it's probably best to go back to the beginning. Well, that seems like a life time ago it really only has been six to eight weeks, more specifically PulteGroup and the broader housing industry entered 2020 with tremendous momentum and strong buyer demand. And this is reflected in the 16% growth in orders that we reported for the first quarter compared with the prior year. Our reported Q1 order growth, however, is not reflective of current market conditions. In the first quarter, net new orders were up more than 30% over the prior year for both January and February. It's now old news when I say that with the virus spreading rapidly and governments implementing shelter in place restrictions, home buying demands slowed dramatically as March progressed. To appreciate the magnitude of the slowdown in the first full week of March our net new order exceeded 800 homes. In the final full week this number dropped to just 140. As a result our March 2020 orders in total were down 11% from March of 2019. From orders being up 30 plus percent to being down 11% in just a few weeks is unlike anything we have experienced before. It's this level of volatility along with the dramatic economic slowdown and ongoing job loss that let us to withdraw our guidance for 2020 as indicated in our press release earlier today and we will not be providing any new guidance until condition stabilize. Given how the U.S. economic slowdown intensify as we moved into April, it is no surprise that housing demand has slipped even further. Through the first three weeks of the month we have sold approximately 920 homes on a gross basis excluding cancellations. The underlying trend is the buyer traffic to our website and in turn our communities has decreased materially. This is obviously a very small sample size. But directionally, we are running a little below 50% of the pace in the first quarter with the most recent trends generally stable to up slightly. While the impact of COVID-19 was hard and fast PulteGroup is fortunate to have an experienced management team throughout our organization. In other words, we have been through slowdowns before such that we can and are responding quickly. A cadence of functional meetings, Skype calls to be exact, at every level of our operations were organized and are ongoing. Based on real time insights supplied by frontline managers we are routinely adjusting sales, construction, purchasing, mortgage and other functional practices to the rapidly changing market conditions. Important information from these division level meetings has been routinely shared via a daily call with my senior team that reviews everything from customer traffic and sales, to land investments and conditions in the mortgage market. Think of my leadership calls as a virtual war room in which we can quickly assess ongoing events and adjust business tactics as required. It's vital that information flows both ways inside our organization. We can quickly disseminate critical data and decisions back into our operations via internal to the newly built section within our intranet. This section also acts as a data repository for key policies and materials as well as robust and growing warehouse of best practice videos. These videos cover everything from the direct marketing and managing a great virtual house tour to conducting an efficiently option selection meeting online and even closing a home purchase remotely. I won't take you through the daily, even hourly evolution of our business practices but I will share with you how we are operating the business today. To help ensure the health and safety of our customers and employees we are working remotely and leveraging available technology platforms to enable virtual interactions with our home buyers from walking computer-generated floor plans and taking a lot on our interactive community maps to selecting options and applying for and ultimately closing the mortgage. At this point, we're able to effectively do everything remotely. In fact, I fully expect we will be integrating a number of these new practices into our selling processes even as we move back to more normal operating conditions. I think our millennials and active adult buyers in particular will appreciate having more options in terms of how they interact with the home buying process. For potential home buyers who do want to visit a model and meet in person such meetings were permitted are by appointment only. Appointments ensure we can control the number of attendees and enforce social distancing as well as to provide time for us to implement our enhanced cleaning protocols. Moving from sales to construction. We are working closely with our trades to confirm compliance with national and local guidelines relating to social distancing and on-site health and personal hygiene practices. Construction has been designated an essential service across all of our markets except for Michigan, Pennsylvania, the state of Washington and key municipalities in Northern California. We have also notified our homebuyers that we will be providing warranty service for emergency situations only until this crisis has passed. Finally, as an extension of protecting the health and reducing risks for entire team for the end of March, we made the decision to guarantee employment for all PulteGroup employees through the end of April. We wanted to make sure we provided a sense of security, so our employees could focus on their families and on taking care of our customers. Given the severity of the economic slowdown, we\u2019ve recognized that staffing actions will be needed to better align overhead expenses given the slowdown in housing demand and we are planning for such but this decision is consistent with PulteGroup's employee first culture. Beyond our people, given the challenging operating environment and economic uncertainties resulting from COVID-19, our focus is on protecting the company's liquidity and closely managing our cash flows. Bob will review details shortly but let me provide a few high-level comments on the actions that we have taken today. On the land side, we are working closely with our existing land sellers to postpone the purchase of land parcels currently under contract. Land sellers understand what's happening in the market, so conversations typically take a collaborative approach. I am extremely pleased to say that we have been successful in delaying well over 90% of the lots scheduled for purchase in the near term. We would hope to have similar success as and when we need to deal with contracted land positions scheduled to close in the future. In the rare situations where we have been unable to agree on some form of extension with the land seller, we have walked away from the lots and our pre-acquisition expense. In the first quarter, these charges amounted to only $4 million. In a similar fashion we are working to intelligently slow land development such that it is more appropriately aligned with the current sales environment. At this point our approach is focused on delaying development rather than outright mothballing communities. The latter may become a tactic depending on how the slowdown plays out but for now we want to continue turning assets even at a reduced rate. We've also implemented strategies to limit the amount of capital we are investing in vertical construction. This includes contacting backlog customers and reconfirming their status before beginning to construction of that sold unit. Having said that between our existing spec starts and an elevated cancellation rate, we have spec units in production that we are also moving on to a slower track. At quarter end we had a total of about 3,100 specs in the pipeline of which almost 40% were early enough in the build cycle that we are able to suspend further construction. Depending upon the exact stage of production, construction on the remaining spec units will be held, slowly advanced or completed on schedule and then sold. Given the actions that we've taken to adjust land and house spend we'll be able to postpone several hundred million dollars in cash outflows by effectively idling parts of our business, we can maintain strong liquidity while positioning our operations to meet buyer demand. However, it develops over the remainder of 2020 and into the next year. It's hard to envision a more difficult operating environment than what we are experiencing today and I don't even want to try to sugarcoat it. That being said given the way that we have been running the business over the past decade I do believe that PulteGroup is very well positioned both operationally and financially to navigate the challenging and volatile market conditions we'll face until the impacts of the pandemics recede. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for first quarter operating and financial results. Bob? \nBob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. Before starting my review let me reiterate that we have withdrawn our previous guidance relating to our 2020 results and we will not be providing any new guidance at this time this decision was driven by the dramatic impact Corona virus has had on unemployment, GDP and consumer confidence the result of which is that it's impossible for us to forecast how markets and buyers will respond when conditions ultimately begin to improve. We are optimistic that buyer demand has the ability to rebound but there's too much uncertainty at this time for us to provide meaningful guidance. As Ryan indicated given the dramatic change in demand dynamics and overall market conditions, I'm not going to walk through our first quarter statements in the usual detail. I will however discuss Q1 results on a high level business to operate over the next couple of quarters. Looking at the income statement, home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 14% to $2.2 billion. Higher revenues in the period were driven by a 16% increase in closings for 5373 homes, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average sales price to $413,000. The decrease in average sales price for the quarter was driven primarily by changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed. Product mix continues to benefit from the expansion of our first-time business which increased to 33% of our closings in the quarter, up from 25% last year. In addition, 42% of our closings came from move up buyers and the remaining 25% came from active adult buyers. In the prior year 48% of closings were move up and 27% were active adult. At 33% of closings, we have achieved our stated goal of having first-time represent about one third of our business. Given our growing investment in first-time and the fact that it was experiencing the strongest demand prior to the slowdown. First time could increase slightly in the percentage of our overall business going forward. As Ryan noted, orders for the first quarter were up 16% to 7,495 homes. By buyer group first-time orders were up 31% to [3,345] homes and active adult was at 5% to 1,674 homes. Driven in part we ended the quarter with 12,629 homes in backlog which is up 20% over the first quarter of last year. Given the strong order rates over the past several quarters, we ended the Q1 with 12,088 homes under construction which represents an increase of 17% over last year. It was driven entirely by sold homes as spec production on an unit base [indiscernible] and represented only 26% of homes under construction. Consistent with Ryan's comments we had curtailed new spec starts for the time being and are identifying opportunities to efficiently and safely pause construction spec units already in production. Ideally, this would entail holding units at the foundation stage but we can hold after they are dried in if needed. While we are not providing guidance in regard to expected quarterly or annual results I think it's useful to share information on backlog performance and the current state of our construction operations. First to-date buyers have wanted to close relative to the size of our backlog we are seeing minimal cancellations with most as you would expect driven by job loss results from the coronavirus. Through the first week [indiscernible] we've had 360 backlog of units cancel which represents only 3% of homes in backlog. Based on these numbers and our experiences to-date it's clear that our home buyers are willing and even anxious to get into the safety of their new home. Second, our trades want to work. We remain in close communication with our trades to coordinate activities and ensure we are operating in compliance with all work rules and safety guidelines. As we have had to adjust the cadence of start and also production timeline ongoing communication with our trade base is critical to maintaining production efficiency. And third, we are having to proactively and intelligently manage the supply chain. The initial challenge is adjusting to any disruption in materials and our components from China. We were fortunate and that we had recently conducted an extensive analysis that supply chain in response to the U.S.-China tariff issues in 2019. More recently however, we are dealing with the closures of U.S. plants as a result of state or municipal restrictions to keep people at home. The U.S.-based plants typically have less inventory in the supply chain so adjustments have to be made very quickly. For commodities and mechanicals like plumbing, electrical and HVAC, we can usually swap to an upgrade or identify comparable product manufactured by another supplier. It's much more difficult when the delay involves products such as cabinets, countertops and appliances where colors and styles can be difficult to match. In these instances we are working with our customers to identify suitable alternatives or we may simply have to wait extra days until the required product becomes available. As of today's call delays across the enterprise are relatively minor but they can be disruptive within a specific community or market and may cause delays and completing impacted homes. Continuing with my review of our first quarter results, gross margin for the quarter was 23.7% which is up 30 basis points over the last year and up 90 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin exceeded not only last year but our guidance for the period. In addition to benefits resulting from the mix of homes closed our improved gross margin reflects the prior strength of housing demand and our ability to capture incremental pricing opportunities as incentives decreased to 3.6% in the quarter. This is down 40 basis points from the first quarter of last year and 20 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Broadly, we would generally tell you that prices have been holding. Unlike the back half of [indiscernible] affordability the issues today relate to the inability to leave your home, job loss or simply fear, price does not solve these issues. Price is also benefiting from low levels of new and existing home inventory on the market. That being said spectrum in the industry's production pipeline are rising and cancellations are resulting in inventory build-up in a number of markets across the country [indiscernible] which often lead us to solve a price over pace but we need to continue selling homes and we will be competitive in the market. Our SG&A expenses in the first quarter was $264 million or 11.9% of home sale revenues. This is a 110 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year in which SG&A expenses $253 million or 13% of home sale revenues. The improvement in overhead leverage was driven by the volume growth realized in the quarter. As Ryan discussed, given the ongoing erosion in home buyer demand witnessed across the country we recognize that we will need to make adjustments to our organization. Planning is already in process that will result in furloughs and layoffs in addition to other general cost reductions needed in order to right-size our operations. Moving on, you will see a line for goodwill impairment in our first quarter income statement. Given the significant decline in equity market valuations, we determined that an event driven impairment test on a goodwill associated with our January 2020 acquisition of ICG was appropriate. This test resulted in an impairment totaling $20 million. This impairment was not the result of any factors specific to ICG's operations but rather reflects the broad-based declines in the market capitalizations of publicly traded construction companies during the period. Having now worked with ICG since the closing we're even more excited about the opportunities we see for such offsite production. Of course accounting guidelines don't factor in our excitement but simply evaluate the recoverability of goodwill based on objectively verifiable market data and as we all know the equity markets have been under stress in recent weeks. Looking at our financial services operations, the business generated pre-tax income of $20 million, an increase of 58% over prior year pre-tax income of $12 million. This year's higher pre-tax income reflects an improved margin environment, higher loan buyers consistent with growth in our home-building operations as well as higher tax rate. Mortgage capture rate increased to 87% in the quarter from 80% last year. I would note that given disruptions in the national mortgage market caused by COVID-19, we did have to write down the value of our mortgage servicing rights in the quarter, reported financial services pre-tax income for the first quarter includes this adjustment. Completing my comments on our income statement, our first quarter income tax expense was $60 million or an effective tax rate of 22.8% compared with $50 million for an effective tax rate of 23% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than last year and our recent guidance as we recorded benefits related to equity compensation. In summary for the first quarter our net income was $204 million or $0.74 per share which is an increase from prior year net income of $167 million or $0.59 per share. Turning now to discussion of our balance sheet, cash flows and uses of capital we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash which is up from $1.3 billion at the end of 2019. Our increased cash position primarily reflects our decision to draw $700 million from our revolving credit facility in March. Given the dramatic decline in global economic conditions and the uncertainty of future demand trends we drew on our facility in an abundance of caution. The incremental net interest expense related to these borrowings which will be reflected in interest expense is approximately a million dollars per month so it's low-cost insurance as we move through the next few months.  In the first quarter we invested $619 million in land acquisition and development. On a sequential basis this is a decrease of $152 million from the fourth quarter as we are working quickly to adjust land spend to match the current operating environment. Land acquisition spend in the quarter amounted to only $219 million, our lowest quarterly investment since 2014 and will likely decline further as we work to defer future land purchases. In the first quarter we repurchased 2.8 million common shares for $96 million on average price of $33.86 per share. As business conditions eroded during this month of March, we elected to stop our repurchase activities. At this time we have suspended share repurchases consistent with our focus on conserving capital. In conclusion, we entered this period of economic uncertainty in a position of strength. Our home building operations have proven to be efficient and highly profitable and we maintain ample liquidity. We're operating in a period of unprecedented job loss and economic contraction but I'm confident in our ability to manage through the turmoil and successfully exit to the other side. Let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Bob highlighted that we are dealing with this economic crisis from the position of strength. We've put ourselves in this position by operating a highly profitable and high returning home building business for a number of years. The strong operating results we delivered in this first quarter are consistent with the strategies and tactics against which we have consistently operated. By the time we get through the challenges of COVID-19 we will have adapted to a lot of changes. What won't have changed however is the strategic and disciplined approach we take to running our business which has delivered great financial results in the past. Our work to maintain an exceptional culture and a committed team doesn't change. Our ability to underwriting develop outstanding communities, design to meet customer needs while delivering high returns doesn't change. Our focused on delivering superior quality homes and outstanding customer service doesn't change. So while a lot will change, the fundamentals that have made PulteGroup successful remain solidly in place. In closing, before we open the call to questions, I want to say thank you to our employees and our suppliers who have been absolutely amazing throughout these past few weeks. In a period of heightened risks and fears where and when appropriate you have been on-site and operating in our communities, as required you have quickly adapted to working from home and servicing our customers from a socially acceptable distance. And through it all you have maintained an upbeat attitude and a can-do spirit. It has been impressive to watch. Let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thanks Ryan. Now we are prepared to open the call for questions, so we can get as many questions as possible during the remaining time in this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question one follow-up. Now I will ask Joanne to explain the process and open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys. Good morning. Hope everyone is doing well within the organization and your families and thank you for all of your commentary this morning. My first question if I could and maybe this is directed for Deb but I'd love to hear and dig in a little bit about what's going on in the mortgage markets today? I know the headlines have been kind of fast and furious about tightening in terms of credit overlays being instituted by a number of investors and lenders and I know there's a lot of disruption on the servicing side as well and I'm just curious what you've seen over the last couple weeks in terms of your ability to originate loans, to sell loans, sales servicing rates and taking that a step further, where are the current standards today that your originating for your buyers?\nRyan Marshall: Morning Alan. Thanks for the question. There's certainly a lot there. We are doing well and I hope that everybody at Zelman is healthy as well. Maybe let me just start with some real broad overview comments and then I'll turn it over to Deb. Our Pulte Financial Services team has been absolutely outstanding. We do have very good liquidity. The operations of the mortgage company have really continued with minimal interruption. There certainly are some challenges there but I really do believe that Deb and her team have effectively helped to navigate those. So with that I'll turn it to Deb and she can provide some additional commentary.\nDebra Still: Sure. Thanks Ryan and good morning Alan. Yes, so certainly disruptions. We've seen a lot of headlines, I think one of the things that is important to note is not all disruptions apply to all lender business models and so for Pulte, the majority, for the majority of our loan programs Pulte Mortgage offers, we're working with the same investors. We're working with the same buyers of servicing that we've done business with for years. For Pulte Mortgage, we are looking to add additional investor partners for our government loans where the environment has gotten more restrictive than the conventional market and our strategy remains the same which is the seller loans in the secondary market and to sell our servicing. The jumbo market you read headlines that it may be frozen and while I think there's far fewer participants, we're partnering with several banks and several credit unions that are still buying our jumbo loans and providing us that liquidity. So I'll stop there and see if you want to go into more detail.\nAlan Ratner: Yes. No that's very helpful. Yes, I do have one or two follow-ups to that if I could. I guess on the government side it seems like that's where we've seen some FICO and DTI overlays put in place. I know some lenders have gone as high as 700, not going below that others are kind of more on the 60-80 range. So I guess the question is when you look at your book of business and you look at your backlog it seems like cancellations have been very modest. Are you still able to get a NFHA VA loan done at a call at 640-660 FICO and what percentage of your business actually falls into that criteria right now?\nDebra Still: Yes. So we still have credit available certainly at the 640-660 range. Some investors are requiring loan level price adjustments for those credit scores but for the most part there's decent liquidity at that level Alan, much like our product mix has been for many years FHA and VA together are about 20% of our book of business.\nOperator: Your next your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now open.\nJack Micenko: Good morning everyone. Hope everybody is well on your end.\nRyan Marshall: Good morning Jack.\nJack Micenko: Good morning. I think part of the silver lining here is, you're coming into this with a really-really strong backlog and so I guess first question I have is Ryan, what are the regional heads doing to preserve that backlog? Any kind of strategies there and then Deb what's the mortgage company doing proactively to kind of peel through that backlog? Is it a second set of eyes on the underwriting? Is it a closer touch on the employment status? Just kind of curious, how you guys are managing? There is a lot of forward revenue there and preserving that I would imagine is priority number one.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Jack. Good morning. It's Ryan and we do really, we really do believe that the size of our backlog is a real benefit for us as we move through this crisis. The good news is the majority of that backlog made a buying decision prior to the effects and the impacts of COVID-19 and as Bob highlighted in detail, we've largely seen most of those buyers anxious and ready to move to the closing table. We've certainly done a lot of things in working with our Pulte Financial Services Partners inclusive of doing drive-by closings, where we've been able to sign the majority of the documents virtually and there's only a handful of things that need a wet signature and we've been able to do that without human interaction and contact which has been great. In terms of tactics that our operators are taking to preserve that backlog, we're really working with our buyers in a collaborative way to understand their specific needs in the cases of job loss and things like that. In some cases, we've had to take a cancellation and that's reflected in the numbers that Bob shared with you. Certainly, we've got great partnership with our mortgage company on a number of fronts and not only does that help minimize risk they provide just outstanding products and service. Our mortgage team has been able to give us insight into concentrations of customers that might fall into a particular industry but we are very careful not to violate any of the banking regulations that would prohibit the mortgage company from sharing specific buyer data. So those are a few of the things that we've been doing to manage the backlog.\nJack Micenko: Okay. And then one for Bob. Looking at cash, stock a buyback slowing down the land spend, monetizing backlog, cash position probably balloons pretty significantly into year end. So assuming new recovery, how do you think about the cash, 12 months out I mean Ryan your comment sounded like prepared for the worst, hope for the best but you said looking the cash numbers $2.5 billion, $3 billion is kind of numbers, no debt coming due to 2021. If we get to the other side of this is just going to be buyback, is it going to be reaccelerate the land spend because the demand is there and you've got to catch up? How do you think about this is large likely cash positions into this year?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes Jack, thanks for the question and hopefully we are wrestling with that particular question. I think our view on this is we wanted to get as liquid as we could. We drew on our revolver just from a precautionary standpoint. So I think the first use of any cash would be as we get more comfortable with this we would seek to pay that down. You mentioned that we've got a maturity in March of next year not that far away that would be a pretty high priority for our cash depending on market conditions would we refinance it, I don't know it'll depend but other than that I think the process we will go through is no different than what we've been doing for the last five plus years, which is evaluating the opportunity to generate return from that cash. So if we think there's an opportunity in the land market obviously that would be a place where we place primary importance on investing. If we have excess capacity beyond that we're always thinking about repurchase activity. We've obviously stopped that as time goes by, we will revisit whether that's appropriate and we obviously pay a dividend. We'll be in the course of normal discussion with our board visiting what we do with that over time. So I think the answer is, isn't really any different but I would tell you obviously the first thing we would think about is the revolver and paying that down. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning everyone and hope everyone in the Pulte family, extended family are safe and healthy in this time. First question I had was, if I could try to get a little more clarity obviously appreciate it with regard to order trends in the last six weeks or so and obviously appreciate all the details that you've given. I think what a lot of people are thinking about is trying to parse out in terms of the orders and the fall-off in orders which markets and which segments maybe you've seen it the worst? You mentioned about a 50% decline in sales pace versus the first quarter in April. And so I was curious if there's any additional granularity you might have for us in terms of buy market which markets may be saw a greater drop-off and across your three major consumer segments where you saw it a little worse or better?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike good morning. What I would tell you is that, April started very slow as the majority of the country went into shelter-in-place type orders. Some markets very aggressive, late end of March, early part of April and then eventually you saw the entire country go into that mode. As our sales processes evolved and caught up to that we went to by appointment only for the protection of not only our sales team but also the customers and then we quickly adapted to a lot of virtual selling practices with virtual tours, heavy use of Microsoft teams do engage with customers where we could share documents and the various choices the buyer would have and what we saw as we move through April, each week we were doing more virtual appointments. Our team got more comfortable with it. I think buyers got more comfortable with it and so we were encouraged by that. We had, as I shared with you we had over 900 sales in April to-date which in this environment we're largely the entire country is still at home to be able to sell that many homes virtually, I think is a fairly decent result. We are starting to see some pretty positive trends in our traffic data just starting this week as we think more of the -- I think because more of the country is talking about reopening. We've seen certain states already take action to reopen and I think some of the understanding and the fears around COVID-19 is starting to subside. We're seeing some positive traffic trends which I think bodes well. In terms of consumer groups and segments, the one that I would tell you was probably down the most early as the Dell Webb consumer which I'm sure as you can appreciate is understandable. Number one, that's an aged demographic that is most susceptible and at the highest risk to the virus and so that's a buyer group that I think was early on the most cautious and probably continues to be. There also a buyer group that's heavily influenced by volatility in the equity markets which we know there was plenty of that in the back half of March. As that's stabilized and as the virus starts to come under control we started to see that buyer group rebound. It's a buyer group that's got great liquidity. They've got strong wealth. They're not as dependent on the job market and so we're actually starting to see some nice trends from that group. What I tell you though Mike is every buyer group is susceptible to the impacts of this virus. I don't think there's any one group that is going to be untouched. They may go through different phases as the impacts to the economy move through the entire system.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks Ryan. I appreciate that answer. I guess for the second question, maybe if I could sneak in slightly a two part. Number one you mentioned the virtual orders coming in. Of that 960, I was curious roughly what percent was able to be counted as an order without the customer even physically walking into the home and conversely you had mentioned in a prior question around the 360 cans in the first three weeks of April. I think primarily driven by job loss. I just wanted to try and get a sense again going back to the, I guess you want to call backlog scrubbing, if you feel like that 360 represents fully the initial job losses that we've seen across the country or if the tension there might be an additional portion of the backlog susceptible to the recent unemployment trends?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Mike, in terms of how many of the April sales we are able to do everything virtually I don't have that number at my fingertips. I would tell you it was the lion share of the process was done virtually. There are some buyers that maybe they wanted to do at least one on-site visit. It wasn't required however and we were set up operationally that the entire process could be handled virtually. So we feel really good about that. In terms of the cancellations there's some number of cancellations that we take in a given month just as a normal order, a normal course of business and that's reflected in what is our kind of normal cancellation rate for those that we've seen in April, I would tell you probably the majority were COVID related in some way shape or form. Most of those kind of relating to job loss or family health reasons. As we move kind of through this, yes I think there's certainly continued risk depending on how deep and how prolonged the downturn is and then what the recovery looks like. So the job loss or the unemployment claims today were a little better than they were last week but at over 4 million it's still a pretty big number and we'll ultimately just need to see how that plays out over the coming weeks and months.\nOperator: Your next question comes the line of Steven Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nSteven Kim: Yes. Thanks a lot Ryan and team and thanks for all the information thus far, sounds like you are doing as great a job as one could expect in this environment. There were some very interesting things that you mentioned with respect to how things have been evolving very recently and so far in April and I just wanted to knit a couple of things together that you've said and just sort of get your overarching view as to how the demand picture looks. I think you indicated that when you gave your numbers for cancellations and the sales you were doing obviously it seemed like it picked up relative to the final week of March in terms of the gross orders and then on top of that your cancellation rate if I were to extrapolate that out to a full quarter, looks like you're talking about a backlog can rate of maybe 12% or something like that for a full quarters worth, which is like less than a half of what you saw during the global financial crisis. You said price isn't really the issue and people are wanting to move in. So with all of that said, I'm curious as to how you think this buyer pullback compares to other demand pull backs that we've seen? Usually, for instance when you see demand pull back there is kind of an immediate price response sort of a demand for that and it doesn't seem like that's happening today and you've seen a pickup in traffic even before the states have opened up. So it feels to me almost as if there's like, like a fire that's gone dormant because I had a blanket thrown over it and then the blanket gets removed there may be a spike in demand and I'm wondering if you would be ready to capture that and if you think that that's, even something that's worth preparing for or if it's more important to sort of be defensive in the case that things get worse and linger. So my question is a little bit of complicated, I apologize but how are you seeing the demand potential just spike in the next let's say month or two as things actually do open up? And what are some of the things that you're doing to position yourself to capture that if in fact that happened?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Steven it's a great question and I would tell you, we don't have a better crystal ball than anybody else does in terms of what the recovery ultimately looks like. Is it a U? Is it V? Is it an L? Is it a square root recovery? There's a ton of theories out there. We're looking and studying all of them. I think you made a couple of interesting points that I would tend to agree with buyer desire to own a home seems to be holding pretty strong and pretty steady and strong. The ultimate question I think is going to be when does the economy start to reopen and how deep and prolonger the job losses. We know that jobs are a critical component of a home buyer being able to make the decision to move and do something different. If the job losses can be minimized and the folks that have been furloughed or able to be called back I think that bodes well for housing. Different than I think other housing downturns typically there has been a buildup of supply which we don't have right now. There's not a buildup on the resale side. There's not a buildup on the new side and so I would tell you that's largely why we've seen price continue to hold. Bob's prepared remarks I think hit the nail right on the head which is, this is something that is being driven by partly fear, partly folks being at home and not being able to leave their home s and price doesn't necessarily solve that. And so I think what you've seen from the industry for the most part is there hasn't been a lot of discounting other than in a few places where we've seen some co-broke type incentives to move inventory that was finished. We haven't seen in the market broad-based price reductions on base pricing which I think is generally a positive. In terms of being opportunistic Steven I think our model of having a very large backlog that is over 12,000 at this point that puts us in a very good position assuming the cancellation rates remain where they're at and for clarity we're running at a level that we're 3% for the month of April. I think that translates into something a little less than the number that you quoted but we'll see kind of what that cancellation rate ultimately trends to for the full quarter.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Steven just to maybe further clarify that the cans, I think what you're going to see is based on the sales level that we're seeing today, gross and the cans against that 12,000 unit backlog, you will likely see an elevated cancellation rate in Q2 because you're going to have a reduced sales environment we've highlighted that sales are down, you have cans while they're not huge against the total backlog are going to be big against that relative number. So just, I heard you say that we might have a lower can rate in Q2 or net can rate is that will not be the case.\nStephen Kim: Yes, I was referring to a backlog can rate. Just to hear because I think that's --\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Got it.\nStephen Kim: Okay. So yes, that's great. Appreciate that. Sort of kind of follow up on that, I feel like it would be interesting to hear particularly that you're -- given your headquarter in Georgia, how you're planning on handling a reopening policy which probably won't be unified across the country and so I'm curious as to how whether Pulte would be adopting kind of a across the country kind of a policy or will it be determined locally. And I'm also curious if you could talk about this pricing issue, how your price release and an issue you have seen a lot of discounting. I'm curious is that whether you're actually seeing any desire on the part of the people who are buying, to actually in fact maybe upgrade, maybe are you seeing any increased demand for an extra bedroom let's say or maybe the home office and then lastly are you seeing, can you give us a sense for what percent of your buyers need to sell a home first and how that's factoring into the demand picture today?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Steven let me -- there's a lot there. Let me see if I can organize kind of my response.\nStephen Kim: Yes, it was the reopening, the demand for extra maybe upgrades and then what percent need to sell a home first?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. So in terms of reopening we are taking a coordinated effort from our corporate office and working with our regional heads and our division presidents in terms of how we reopen but it will be a customized approach by state, by market, even by sale center or by active community in some cases. So in most of the places where.\nRyan Marshall: Well, let me back up we will not open anywhere until we're permitted by state and/or local regulation. That being said we will open on the timeframe that we believe is appropriate for us once permitted by local regulation. So in Georgia, to your point starting this weekend a lot of the Georgia economy is starting to reopen, we will be taking a phased approach and how we reopen our corporate office as well as how we open our sales centers in Georgia. In terms of upgrading Steven, I think what you'll likely see is a lot of folks that have been maybe living in more confined spaces whether the apartments condos. My guess is you're going to see an elevated desire for maybe suburbia and having a little bit more space. I think most of our homes do come with the ability to have flex space and do things like home office's and I would absolutely see that being high on the list of things that buyers would want And finally as it relates to homes to sell, I don't know that's necessarily changed from what the historical trends were in talking with a number of resale agents that I know here locally as well as across the country. There's actually kind of a tight supply of good inventory on the resale market and so the feedback that I'm getting is if the home is priced properly and in good condition. They're actually selling and selling fairly quickly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJohn Lovallo: Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions and I hope everyone is well. First question Pulte and many of your competitors have talked about delaying land purchases which clearly makes sense. I'm wondering though are you anticipating any stress at the land developer level? Are developers still able to access capital at this point? Maybe any thoughts around that would be helpful.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. It's a fair question. For the most part we are self developing John and so we are putting raw parcels under contract. For the larger developers we have not gotten any indication that they've got capital constraints. I think they like us are looking at the phasing of development. So phases might be a little bit shorter, might be delaying the next phase until we can work through the existing ones. So we haven't heard of a lot of noise in the market from folks that we have developed in relationships with everybody's focused on cash as you can well imagine but I think it's pretty coordinated at this point.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful and then, the labor challenges that some folks are seeing mostly smaller builders and some of the social distancing that's going on on job-sites, I mean do you get the sense that this could increase the demand or the interest for off-site building and with your ICG acquisition, have you guys seen increased inquiries into the business since COVID has hit?\nRyan Marshall: Yes John. We're excited about ICG as Bob mentioned. We've now been operating with ICG for just over three months. We're more excited today than we were at the time of acquisition as we've started to incorporate ICG products and materials into our Jacksonville operation. It's really gone well. Just like we talked last quarter we really see the implementation and integration of off-site as being a long-term strategic move for the company to address what we really believe are fundamental shortages in labor overtime for the industry. My guess is that as social distancing practices will likely continue well into the future. I don't think this is a 30 or 60 day time frame. We're going to be working on social distancing, I think for a long time to come even better opportunity to take advantage of the labor efficiencies that are created by using off-site. So suffice to say, we were excited then. We're more excited now and we're looking forward to continuing to see that expansion through our operation over the coming years.\nOperator: Your next question comes in line of Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nTruman Patterson: Hi good morning everybody and glad to hear you all are safe. So first question you all have a proprietary pricing tool that's really helped you achieve elevated gross margins. I'm just hoping you could shed some light on the existing markets pricing as I would imagine there's a lack of inventory that you mentioned. There's also a lack of foreclosures with forbearance which I think is going to help support the existing market pricing but have you seen any local market pricing that started to crack or rollover or are there any local metros that you're really watching near term?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Truman good morning. It's Ryan. I think we addressed in some of the prepared remarks. We've actually seen price hold pretty steady. The only pricing actions that we've really seen there's a few spots where certain builders have had an elevated level of spec inventory and in an effort to move those, they put some financing incentives in place or some elevated co-broke incentives which I think ultimately at the end of the day is more of an advertising mechanism as opposed to a price mechanism. So underlying values in this environment I think have held steady. We haven't seen broad-based discounting on to be built orders. I haven't necessarily even seen broad-based discounting on the resale side either. So knock on wood, we'd hope that that can hold. For the time being the results have been positive.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Got you. So specifically no real local metros that have really started to crack or anything along those lines?\nRyan Marshall: Correct. \nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thank you and then just hoping to get a bit of an overview on the broader land environment but really what I'm hoping to understand is whether you all are restructuring any of your options land deals and what those are starting to look like in those conversations and then also if you could look forward maybe one to two quarters what portion or magnitude of the option deals are possibly at risk of being written off?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. It's interesting. There isn't any particular form or fashion just like the way we've built the land book it is negotiation with individual sellers and as we mentioned on the call to this point everybody understands we had very limited impact that we had highlighted $4 million in write offs of pre-acts and we've got a normal run rate of 2. If you think about it every quarter we usually have a couple of million dollars. So it was slightly elevated but not materially. So I think what that tells you is that the dialogue we're having with our sellers is constructive. In some cases we've deferred 30 days. In some cases we've deferred 60 days. In some cases 90 and I think we'll continue to evaluate it as we go forward. I don't know that there's any particular bucket of the contracts that we have in place today that are any more or less at risk than anything else quite honestly. The decision to move forward is going to be based on how we see the market and whether we get the return we are seeking from the investment we're making and we'll make those decisions candidly community by community. So we are working with all of the sellers and I talked about development spend, we're suggesting to folks, hey! don't put more money into it because we may need to wait a little while and they understand that. So on balance you never know where this is going to go because demand will dictate how we operate.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Truman the only thing I'd add to that is when we negotiate land transactions we underwrite the return as I think you well know, the two big variables in that are pace and price and we've talked to price in your first question which is largely held pretty consistent. Pace is the unknown and until we kind of come out of this recovery and we start to see how things recover that's what might ultimately kind of dictate what happens to underlying land values but we do believe based on the optionality that we've really worked to put into our land book over the last several years whereas well positioned as the company's ever been to create some real optionality and how our land book comes on to our balance sheet or how we ultimately purchase things over the coming months.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead sir.\nJim Zeumer: Okay. Well, thank you Joanne. I apologize there were a few more questions we just didn\u2019t, we've run out of time on this call. We will certainly be available over the course of the day if you do have any other questions. We did run a little bit long. We want to provide as many comments as we could in our prepared script and hopefully answer as many questions as we could that way. Thank you for your time. Stay well and we'll look forward to speaking to you on the next call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks Jim and good morning. Before I begin let me offer my thoughts and prayers to everyone on the call today and in the communities in which PulteGroup operates. I sincerely hope that you and your families are well and are managing through the challenges created by COVID-19. I also want to acknowledge and say thank you to our nation's healthcare workers and first responders who have been remarkable in fighting the onsite of this disease. Given the devastating effects COVID-19 has had across the country I am going to focus my comments on the company's specific impacts and our operational responses. Bob will then discuss some of the key numbers within our first quarter results. As well as some factors to consider as you think about our business going forward. COVID-19, it's probably best to go back to the beginning. Well, that seems like a life time ago it really only has been six to eight weeks, more specifically PulteGroup and the broader housing industry entered 2020 with tremendous momentum and strong buyer demand. And this is reflected in the 16% growth in orders that we reported for the first quarter compared with the prior year. Our reported Q1 order growth, however, is not reflective of current market conditions. In the first quarter, net new orders were up more than 30% over the prior year for both January and February. It's now old news when I say that with the virus spreading rapidly and governments implementing shelter in place restrictions, home buying demands slowed dramatically as March progressed. To appreciate the magnitude of the slowdown in the first full week of March our net new order exceeded 800 homes. In the final full week this number dropped to just 140. As a result our March 2020 orders in total were down 11% from March of 2019. From orders being up 30 plus percent to being down 11% in just a few weeks is unlike anything we have experienced before. It's this level of volatility along with the dramatic economic slowdown and ongoing job loss that let us to withdraw our guidance for 2020 as indicated in our press release earlier today and we will not be providing any new guidance until condition stabilize. Given how the U.S. economic slowdown intensify as we moved into April, it is no surprise that housing demand has slipped even further. Through the first three weeks of the month we have sold approximately 920 homes on a gross basis excluding cancellations. The underlying trend is the buyer traffic to our website and in turn our communities has decreased materially. This is obviously a very small sample size. But directionally, we are running a little below 50% of the pace in the first quarter with the most recent trends generally stable to up slightly. While the impact of COVID-19 was hard and fast PulteGroup is fortunate to have an experienced management team throughout our organization. In other words, we have been through slowdowns before such that we can and are responding quickly. A cadence of functional meetings, Skype calls to be exact, at every level of our operations were organized and are ongoing. Based on real time insights supplied by frontline managers we are routinely adjusting sales, construction, purchasing, mortgage and other functional practices to the rapidly changing market conditions. Important information from these division level meetings has been routinely shared via a daily call with my senior team that reviews everything from customer traffic and sales, to land investments and conditions in the mortgage market. Think of my leadership calls as a virtual war room in which we can quickly assess ongoing events and adjust business tactics as required. It's vital that information flows both ways inside our organization. We can quickly disseminate critical data and decisions back into our operations via internal to the newly built section within our intranet. This section also acts as a data repository for key policies and materials as well as robust and growing warehouse of best practice videos. These videos cover everything from the direct marketing and managing a great virtual house tour to conducting an efficiently option selection meeting online and even closing a home purchase remotely. I won't take you through the daily, even hourly evolution of our business practices but I will share with you how we are operating the business today. To help ensure the health and safety of our customers and employees we are working remotely and leveraging available technology platforms to enable virtual interactions with our home buyers from walking computer-generated floor plans and taking a lot on our interactive community maps to selecting options and applying for and ultimately closing the mortgage. At this point, we're able to effectively do everything remotely. In fact, I fully expect we will be integrating a number of these new practices into our selling processes even as we move back to more normal operating conditions. I think our millennials and active adult buyers in particular will appreciate having more options in terms of how they interact with the home buying process. For potential home buyers who do want to visit a model and meet in person such meetings were permitted are by appointment only. Appointments ensure we can control the number of attendees and enforce social distancing as well as to provide time for us to implement our enhanced cleaning protocols. Moving from sales to construction. We are working closely with our trades to confirm compliance with national and local guidelines relating to social distancing and on-site health and personal hygiene practices. Construction has been designated an essential service across all of our markets except for Michigan, Pennsylvania, the state of Washington and key municipalities in Northern California. We have also notified our homebuyers that we will be providing warranty service for emergency situations only until this crisis has passed. Finally, as an extension of protecting the health and reducing risks for entire team for the end of March, we made the decision to guarantee employment for all PulteGroup employees through the end of April. We wanted to make sure we provided a sense of security, so our employees could focus on their families and on taking care of our customers. Given the severity of the economic slowdown, we've recognized that staffing actions will be needed to better align overhead expenses given the slowdown in housing demand and we are planning for such but this decision is consistent with PulteGroup's employee first culture. Beyond our people, given the challenging operating environment and economic uncertainties resulting from COVID-19, our focus is on protecting the company's liquidity and closely managing our cash flows. Bob will review details shortly but let me provide a few high-level comments on the actions that we have taken today. On the land side, we are working closely with our existing land sellers to postpone the purchase of land parcels currently under contract. Land sellers understand what's happening in the market, so conversations typically take a collaborative approach. I am extremely pleased to say that we have been successful in delaying well over 90% of the lots scheduled for purchase in the near term. We would hope to have similar success as and when we need to deal with contracted land positions scheduled to close in the future. In the rare situations where we have been unable to agree on some form of extension with the land seller, we have walked away from the lots and our pre-acquisition expense. In the first quarter, these charges amounted to only $4 million. In a similar fashion we are working to intelligently slow land development such that it is more appropriately aligned with the current sales environment. At this point our approach is focused on delaying development rather than outright mothballing communities. The latter may become a tactic depending on how the slowdown plays out but for now we want to continue turning assets even at a reduced rate. We've also implemented strategies to limit the amount of capital we are investing in vertical construction. This includes contacting backlog customers and reconfirming their status before beginning to construction of that sold unit. Having said that between our existing spec starts and an elevated cancellation rate, we have spec units in production that we are also moving on to a slower track. At quarter end we had a total of about 3,100 specs in the pipeline of which almost 40% were early enough in the build cycle that we are able to suspend further construction. Depending upon the exact stage of production, construction on the remaining spec units will be held, slowly advanced or completed on schedule and then sold. Given the actions that we've taken to adjust land and house spend we'll be able to postpone several hundred million dollars in cash outflows by effectively idling parts of our business, we can maintain strong liquidity while positioning our operations to meet buyer demand. However, it develops over the remainder of 2020 and into the next year. It's hard to envision a more difficult operating environment than what we are experiencing today and I don't even want to try to sugarcoat it. That being said given the way that we have been running the business over the past decade I do believe that PulteGroup is very well positioned both operationally and financially to navigate the challenging and volatile market conditions we'll face until the impacts of the pandemics recede. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for first quarter operating and financial results. Bob? Bob highlighted that we are dealing with this economic crisis from the position of strength. We've put ourselves in this position by operating a highly profitable and high returning home building business for a number of years. The strong operating results we delivered in this first quarter are consistent with the strategies and tactics against which we have consistently operated. By the time we get through the challenges of COVID-19 we will have adapted to a lot of changes. What won't have changed however is the strategic and disciplined approach we take to running our business which has delivered great financial results in the past. Our work to maintain an exceptional culture and a committed team doesn't change. Our ability to underwriting develop outstanding communities, design to meet customer needs while delivering high returns doesn't change. Our focused on delivering superior quality homes and outstanding customer service doesn't change. So while a lot will change, the fundamentals that have made PulteGroup successful remain solidly in place. In closing, before we open the call to questions, I want to say thank you to our employees and our suppliers who have been absolutely amazing throughout these past few weeks. In a period of heightened risks and fears where and when appropriate you have been on-site and operating in our communities, as required you have quickly adapted to working from home and servicing our customers from a socially acceptable distance. And through it all you have maintained an upbeat attitude and a can-do spirit. It has been impressive to watch. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Morning Alan. Thanks for the question. There's certainly a lot there. We are doing well and I hope that everybody at Zelman is healthy as well. Maybe let me just start with some real broad overview comments and then I'll turn it over to Deb. Our Pulte Financial Services team has been absolutely outstanding. We do have very good liquidity. The operations of the mortgage company have really continued with minimal interruption. There certainly are some challenges there but I really do believe that Deb and her team have effectively helped to navigate those. So with that I'll turn it to Deb and she can provide some additional commentary. Good morning Jack. Yes Jack. Good morning. It's Ryan and we do really, we really do believe that the size of our backlog is a real benefit for us as we move through this crisis. The good news is the majority of that backlog made a buying decision prior to the effects and the impacts of COVID-19 and as Bob highlighted in detail, we've largely seen most of those buyers anxious and ready to move to the closing table. We've certainly done a lot of things in working with our Pulte Financial Services Partners inclusive of doing drive-by closings, where we've been able to sign the majority of the documents virtually and there's only a handful of things that need a wet signature and we've been able to do that without human interaction and contact which has been great. In terms of tactics that our operators are taking to preserve that backlog, we're really working with our buyers in a collaborative way to understand their specific needs in the cases of job loss and things like that. In some cases, we've had to take a cancellation and that's reflected in the numbers that Bob shared with you. Certainly, we've got great partnership with our mortgage company on a number of fronts and not only does that help minimize risk they provide just outstanding products and service. Our mortgage team has been able to give us insight into concentrations of customers that might fall into a particular industry but we are very careful not to violate any of the banking regulations that would prohibit the mortgage company from sharing specific buyer data. So those are a few of the things that we've been doing to manage the backlog. Yes, Mike good morning. What I would tell you is that, April started very slow as the majority of the country went into shelter-in-place type orders. Some markets very aggressive, late end of March, early part of April and then eventually you saw the entire country go into that mode. As our sales processes evolved and caught up to that we went to by appointment only for the protection of not only our sales team but also the customers and then we quickly adapted to a lot of virtual selling practices with virtual tours, heavy use of Microsoft teams do engage with customers where we could share documents and the various choices the buyer would have and what we saw as we move through April, each week we were doing more virtual appointments. Our team got more comfortable with it. I think buyers got more comfortable with it and so we were encouraged by that. We had, as I shared with you we had over 900 sales in April to-date which in this environment we're largely the entire country is still at home to be able to sell that many homes virtually, I think is a fairly decent result. We are starting to see some pretty positive trends in our traffic data just starting this week as we think more of the -- I think because more of the country is talking about reopening. We've seen certain states already take action to reopen and I think some of the understanding and the fears around COVID-19 is starting to subside. We're seeing some positive traffic trends which I think bodes well. In terms of consumer groups and segments, the one that I would tell you was probably down the most early as the Dell Webb consumer which I'm sure as you can appreciate is understandable. Number one, that's an aged demographic that is most susceptible and at the highest risk to the virus and so that's a buyer group that I think was early on the most cautious and probably continues to be. There also a buyer group that's heavily influenced by volatility in the equity markets which we know there was plenty of that in the back half of March. As that's stabilized and as the virus starts to come under control we started to see that buyer group rebound. It's a buyer group that's got great liquidity. They've got strong wealth. They're not as dependent on the job market and so we're actually starting to see some nice trends from that group. What I tell you though Mike is every buyer group is susceptible to the impacts of this virus. I don't think there's any one group that is going to be untouched. They may go through different phases as the impacts to the economy move through the entire system. Yes. Mike, in terms of how many of the April sales we are able to do everything virtually I don't have that number at my fingertips. I would tell you it was the lion share of the process was done virtually. There are some buyers that maybe they wanted to do at least one on-site visit. It wasn't required however and we were set up operationally that the entire process could be handled virtually. So we feel really good about that. In terms of the cancellations there's some number of cancellations that we take in a given month just as a normal order, a normal course of business and that's reflected in what is our kind of normal cancellation rate for those that we've seen in April, I would tell you probably the majority were COVID related in some way shape or form. Most of those kind of relating to job loss or family health reasons. As we move kind of through this, yes I think there's certainly continued risk depending on how deep and how prolonged the downturn is and then what the recovery looks like. So the job loss or the unemployment claims today were a little better than they were last week but at over 4 million it's still a pretty big number and we'll ultimately just need to see how that plays out over the coming weeks and months. Yes, Steven it's a great question and I would tell you, we don't have a better crystal ball than anybody else does in terms of what the recovery ultimately looks like. Is it a U? Is it V? Is it an L? Is it a square root recovery? There's a ton of theories out there. We're looking and studying all of them. I think you made a couple of interesting points that I would tend to agree with buyer desire to own a home seems to be holding pretty strong and pretty steady and strong. The ultimate question I think is going to be when does the economy start to reopen and how deep and prolonger the job losses. We know that jobs are a critical component of a home buyer being able to make the decision to move and do something different. If the job losses can be minimized and the folks that have been furloughed or able to be called back I think that bodes well for housing. Different than I think other housing downturns typically there has been a buildup of supply which we don't have right now. There's not a buildup on the resale side. There's not a buildup on the new side and so I would tell you that's largely why we've seen price continue to hold. Bob's prepared remarks I think hit the nail right on the head which is, this is something that is being driven by partly fear, partly folks being at home and not being able to leave their home s and price doesn't necessarily solve that. And so I think what you've seen from the industry for the most part is there hasn't been a lot of discounting other than in a few places where we've seen some co-broke type incentives to move inventory that was finished. We haven't seen in the market broad-based price reductions on base pricing which I think is generally a positive. In terms of being opportunistic Steven I think our model of having a very large backlog that is over 12,000 at this point that puts us in a very good position assuming the cancellation rates remain where they're at and for clarity we're running at a level that we're 3% for the month of April. I think that translates into something a little less than the number that you quoted but we'll see kind of what that cancellation rate ultimately trends to for the full quarter. Well, let me back up we will not open anywhere until we're permitted by state and/or local regulation. That being said we will open on the timeframe that we believe is appropriate for us once permitted by local regulation. So in Georgia, to your point starting this weekend a lot of the Georgia economy is starting to reopen, we will be taking a phased approach and how we reopen our corporate office as well as how we open our sales centers in Georgia. In terms of upgrading Steven, I think what you'll likely see is a lot of folks that have been maybe living in more confined spaces whether the apartments condos. My guess is you're going to see an elevated desire for maybe suburbia and having a little bit more space. I think most of our homes do come with the ability to have flex space and do things like home office's and I would absolutely see that being high on the list of things that buyers would want And finally as it relates to homes to sell, I don't know that's necessarily changed from what the historical trends were in talking with a number of resale agents that I know here locally as well as across the country. There's actually kind of a tight supply of good inventory on the resale market and so the feedback that I'm getting is if the home is priced properly and in good condition. They're actually selling and selling fairly quickly. Yes. It's a fair question. For the most part we are self developing John and so we are putting raw parcels under contract. For the larger developers we have not gotten any indication that they've got capital constraints. I think they like us are looking at the phasing of development. So phases might be a little bit shorter, might be delaying the next phase until we can work through the existing ones. So we haven't heard of a lot of noise in the market from folks that we have developed in relationships with everybody's focused on cash as you can well imagine but I think it's pretty coordinated at this point. Yes John. We're excited about ICG as Bob mentioned. We've now been operating with ICG for just over three months. We're more excited today than we were at the time of acquisition as we've started to incorporate ICG products and materials into our Jacksonville operation. It's really gone well. Just like we talked last quarter we really see the implementation and integration of off-site as being a long-term strategic move for the company to address what we really believe are fundamental shortages in labor overtime for the industry. My guess is that as social distancing practices will likely continue well into the future. I don't think this is a 30 or 60 day time frame. We're going to be working on social distancing, I think for a long time to come even better opportunity to take advantage of the labor efficiencies that are created by using off-site. So suffice to say, we were excited then. We're more excited now and we're looking forward to continuing to see that expansion through our operation over the coming years. Yes, Truman good morning. It's Ryan. I think we addressed in some of the prepared remarks. We've actually seen price hold pretty steady. The only pricing actions that we've really seen there's a few spots where certain builders have had an elevated level of spec inventory and in an effort to move those, they put some financing incentives in place or some elevated co-broke incentives which I think ultimately at the end of the day is more of an advertising mechanism as opposed to a price mechanism. So underlying values in this environment I think have held steady. We haven't seen broad-based discounting on to be built orders. I haven't necessarily even seen broad-based discounting on the resale side either. So knock on wood, we'd hope that that can hold. For the time being the results have been positive. Correct. Yes. It's interesting. There isn't any particular form or fashion just like the way we've built the land book it is negotiation with individual sellers and as we mentioned on the call to this point everybody understands we had very limited impact that we had highlighted $4 million in write offs of pre-acts and we've got a normal run rate of 2.

So on balance you never know where this is going to go because demand will dictate how we operate."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. Before starting my review let me reiterate that we have withdrawn our previous guidance relating to our 2020 results and we will not be providing any new guidance at this time this decision was driven by the dramatic impact Corona virus has had on unemployment, GDP and consumer confidence the result of which is that it's impossible for us to forecast how markets and buyers will respond when conditions ultimately begin to improve. We are optimistic that buyer demand has the ability to rebound but there's too much uncertainty at this time for us to provide meaningful guidance. As Ryan indicated given the dramatic change in demand dynamics and overall market conditions, I'm not going to walk through our first quarter statements in the usual detail. I will however discuss Q1 results on a high level business to operate over the next couple of quarters. Looking at the income statement, home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 14% to $2.2 billion. Higher revenues in the period were driven by a 16% increase in closings for 5373 homes, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average sales price to $413,000. The decrease in average sales price for the quarter was driven primarily by changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed. Product mix continues to benefit from the expansion of our first-time business which increased to 33% of our closings in the quarter, up from 25% last year. In addition, 42% of our closings came from move up buyers and the remaining 25% came from active adult buyers. In the prior year 48% of closings were move up and 27% were active adult. At 33% of closings, we have achieved our stated goal of having first-time represent about one third of our business. Given our growing investment in first-time and the fact that it was experiencing the strongest demand prior to the slowdown. First time could increase slightly in the percentage of our overall business going forward. As Ryan noted, orders for the first quarter were up 16% to 7,495 homes. By buyer group first-time orders were up 31% to [3,345] homes and active adult was at 5% to 1,674 homes. Driven in part we ended the quarter with 12,629 homes in backlog which is up 20% over the first quarter of last year. Given the strong order rates over the past several quarters, we ended the Q1 with 12,088 homes under construction which represents an increase of 17% over last year. It was driven entirely by sold homes as spec production on an unit base [indiscernible] and represented only 26% of homes under construction. Consistent with Ryan's comments we had curtailed new spec starts for the time being and are identifying opportunities to efficiently and safely pause construction spec units already in production. Ideally, this would entail holding units at the foundation stage but we can hold after they are dried in if needed. While we are not providing guidance in regard to expected quarterly or annual results I think it's useful to share information on backlog performance and the current state of our construction operations. First to-date buyers have wanted to close relative to the size of our backlog we are seeing minimal cancellations with most as you would expect driven by job loss results from the coronavirus. Through the first week [indiscernible] we've had 360 backlog of units cancel which represents only 3% of homes in backlog. Based on these numbers and our experiences to-date it's clear that our home buyers are willing and even anxious to get into the safety of their new home. Second, our trades want to work. We remain in close communication with our trades to coordinate activities and ensure we are operating in compliance with all work rules and safety guidelines. As we have had to adjust the cadence of start and also production timeline ongoing communication with our trade base is critical to maintaining production efficiency. And third, we are having to proactively and intelligently manage the supply chain. The initial challenge is adjusting to any disruption in materials and our components from China. We were fortunate and that we had recently conducted an extensive analysis that supply chain in response to the U.S.-China tariff issues in 2019. More recently however, we are dealing with the closures of U.S. plants as a result of state or municipal restrictions to keep people at home. The U.S.-based plants typically have less inventory in the supply chain so adjustments have to be made very quickly. For commodities and mechanicals like plumbing, electrical and HVAC, we can usually swap to an upgrade or identify comparable product manufactured by another supplier. It's much more difficult when the delay involves products such as cabinets, countertops and appliances where colors and styles can be difficult to match. In these instances we are working with our customers to identify suitable alternatives or we may simply have to wait extra days until the required product becomes available. As of today's call delays across the enterprise are relatively minor but they can be disruptive within a specific community or market and may cause delays and completing impacted homes. Continuing with my review of our first quarter results, gross margin for the quarter was 23.7% which is up 30 basis points over the last year and up 90 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin exceeded not only last year but our guidance for the period. In addition to benefits resulting from the mix of homes closed our improved gross margin reflects the prior strength of housing demand and our ability to capture incremental pricing opportunities as incentives decreased to 3.6% in the quarter. This is down 40 basis points from the first quarter of last year and 20 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. Broadly, we would generally tell you that prices have been holding. Unlike the back half of [indiscernible] affordability the issues today relate to the inability to leave your home, job loss or simply fear, price does not solve these issues. Price is also benefiting from low levels of new and existing home inventory on the market. That being said spectrum in the industry's production pipeline are rising and cancellations are resulting in inventory build-up in a number of markets across the country [indiscernible] which often lead us to solve a price over pace but we need to continue selling homes and we will be competitive in the market. Our SG&A expenses in the first quarter was $264 million or 11.9% of home sale revenues. This is a 110 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year in which SG&A expenses $253 million or 13% of home sale revenues. The improvement in overhead leverage was driven by the volume growth realized in the quarter. As Ryan discussed, given the ongoing erosion in home buyer demand witnessed across the country we recognize that we will need to make adjustments to our organization. Planning is already in process that will result in furloughs and layoffs in addition to other general cost reductions needed in order to right-size our operations. Moving on, you will see a line for goodwill impairment in our first quarter income statement. Given the significant decline in equity market valuations, we determined that an event driven impairment test on a goodwill associated with our January 2020 acquisition of ICG was appropriate. This test resulted in an impairment totaling $20 million. This impairment was not the result of any factors specific to ICG's operations but rather reflects the broad-based declines in the market capitalizations of publicly traded construction companies during the period. Having now worked with ICG since the closing we're even more excited about the opportunities we see for such offsite production. Of course accounting guidelines don't factor in our excitement but simply evaluate the recoverability of goodwill based on objectively verifiable market data and as we all know the equity markets have been under stress in recent weeks. Looking at our financial services operations, the business generated pre-tax income of $20 million, an increase of 58% over prior year pre-tax income of $12 million. This year's higher pre-tax income reflects an improved margin environment, higher loan buyers consistent with growth in our home-building operations as well as higher tax rate. Mortgage capture rate increased to 87% in the quarter from 80% last year. I would note that given disruptions in the national mortgage market caused by COVID-19, we did have to write down the value of our mortgage servicing rights in the quarter, reported financial services pre-tax income for the first quarter includes this adjustment. Completing my comments on our income statement, our first quarter income tax expense was $60 million or an effective tax rate of 22.8% compared with $50 million for an effective tax rate of 23% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than last year and our recent guidance as we recorded benefits related to equity compensation. In summary for the first quarter our net income was $204 million or $0.74 per share which is an increase from prior year net income of $167 million or $0.59 per share. Turning now to discussion of our balance sheet, cash flows and uses of capital we ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash which is up from $1.3 billion at the end of 2019. Our increased cash position primarily reflects our decision to draw $700 million from our revolving credit facility in March. Given the dramatic decline in global economic conditions and the uncertainty of future demand trends we drew on our facility in an abundance of caution. The incremental net interest expense related to these borrowings which will be reflected in interest expense is approximately a million dollars per month so it's low-cost insurance as we move through the next few months.  In the first quarter we invested $619 million in land acquisition and development. On a sequential basis this is a decrease of $152 million from the fourth quarter as we are working quickly to adjust land spend to match the current operating environment. Land acquisition spend in the quarter amounted to only $219 million, our lowest quarterly investment since 2014 and will likely decline further as we work to defer future land purchases. In the first quarter we repurchased 2.8 million common shares for $96 million on average price of $33.86 per share. As business conditions eroded during this month of March, we elected to stop our repurchase activities. At this time we have suspended share repurchases consistent with our focus on conserving capital. In conclusion, we entered this period of economic uncertainty in a position of strength. Our home building operations have proven to be efficient and highly profitable and we maintain ample liquidity. We're operating in a period of unprecedented job loss and economic contraction but I'm confident in our ability to manage through the turmoil and successfully exit to the other side. Let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Ryan? Yes Jack, thanks for the question and hopefully we are wrestling with that particular question. I think our view on this is we wanted to get as liquid as we could. We drew on our revolver just from a precautionary standpoint. So I think the first use of any cash would be as we get more comfortable with this we would seek to pay that down. You mentioned that we've got a maturity in March of next year not that far away that would be a pretty high priority for our cash depending on market conditions would we refinance it, I don't know it'll depend but other than that I think the process we will go through is no different than what we've been doing for the last five plus years, which is evaluating the opportunity to generate return from that cash. So if we think there's an opportunity in the land market obviously that would be a place where we place primary importance on investing. If we have excess capacity beyond that we're always thinking about repurchase activity. We've obviously stopped that as time goes by, we will revisit whether that's appropriate and we obviously pay a dividend. We'll be in the course of normal discussion with our board visiting what we do with that over time. So I think the answer is, isn't really any different but I would tell you obviously the first thing we would think about is the revolver and paying that down. Yes, Steven just to maybe further clarify that the cans, I think what you're going to see is based on the sales level that we're seeing today, gross and the cans against that 12,000 unit backlog, you will likely see an elevated cancellation rate in Q2 because you're going to have a reduced sales environment we've highlighted that sales are down, you have cans while they're not huge against the total backlog are going to be big against that relative number. So just, I heard you say that we might have a lower can rate in Q2 or net can rate is that will not be the case. Got it. Yes. Steven let me -- there's a lot there. Let me see if I can organize kind of my response. Yes. So in terms of reopening we are taking a coordinated effort from our corporate office and working with our regional heads and our division presidents in terms of how we reopen but it will be a customized approach by state, by market, even by sale center or by active community in some cases. So in most of the places where. Yes, Truman the only thing I'd add to that is when we negotiate land transactions we underwrite the return as I think you well know, the two big variables in that are pace and price and we've talked to price in your first question which is largely held pretty consistent. Pace is the unknown and until we kind of come out of this recovery and we start to see how things recover that's what might ultimately kind of dictate what happens to underlying land values but we do believe based on the optionality that we've really worked to put into our land book over the last several years whereas well positioned as the company's ever been to create some real optionality and how our land book comes on to our balance sheet or how we ultimately purchase things over the coming months."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Rob. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter earnings for the period ended December 31, 2021. I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of today's call later. I want to highlight that we will be discussing our reported fourth quarter numbers, as well as our results adjusted to exclude the impact of certain reserve adjustments and tax benefits recorded in the period. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. Also, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. It's great to speak with you again and to have this opportunity to review PulteGroup's impressive fourth quarter and full year results. I am extremely proud of what our organization has been able to accomplish. For starters, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for the tremendous effort demonstrated throughout 2021, but particularly in the fourth quarter, from sales to procurement and construction, to our financial services team, you clearly showed what a proud and talented group of determined people can achieve. In a minute, Bob will review our fourth quarter results, but I want to highlight a few of our full year numbers to clearly demonstrate just how much success we've realized over the past 12 months. Even with all the challenges, the homebuilding industry faced in 2021, from supply chain disruptions and labor shortages to municipal delays and COVID waves, we grew our closings by 17% to almost 29,000 homes, benefiting from the very favorable demand and pricing conditions, we increased homebuilding revenues by an even greater 27% to $13.5 billion. We were then able to fully capitalize on this top line growth by expanding gross margins by 210 basis points to 26.4% and driving a 43% increase in our reported full year earnings of $7.43 per share. Our financial discussions tend to focus on the income statement, but I would also highlight that over the past 12 months, we lowered our debt to capital ratio to a historic low of 21.3%, while raising our return on equity to 28%. I would also highlight that over the course of 2021, we continued our disciplined allocation of capital in alignment with our stated priorities. This allocation included investing over $4 billion in land acquisition and land development, increasing our dividend pay rate per share in 2021 by 17%, retiring $726 million of bonds and repurchasing $900 million of stock, reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 6%. There is a lot to be excited about with regard to PulteGroup's 2021 operating and financial results. In assessing our performance, we fully appreciate that we benefited from a very favorable supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace. On the demand side, we saw a strong desire for homeownership across all markets and buyer groups. At one end, we have maturing millennials driving extraordinary demand for first-time and first-move of product, while at the other end, we have empty nesters who are downsizing or retiring into their next stage of life. This demand strength drove an increase of 8% in our 2021 net new orders to almost 32,000 homes, including 6,769 orders in the fourth quarter. The reality is that these numbers could have been significantly higher, but COVID and other challenges impacted our availability of lots, labor and materials, which caused us to intentionally slow sales. As part of our response strategy to these resource constraints, we raised prices in 2021 and actively restricted new home sales through lot releases or similar practices. We continue to implement these actions in the fourth quarter as we raised prices in effectively all our communities. At the same time, we continue to restrict sales in more than half of our communities. The strong demand experienced in the fourth quarter has continued into January with no signs that higher interest rates are impacting the desire for new homes. As we look forward to the year ahead, we are well-positioned to meet the strong demand. We entered 2022 with twice as many spec homes in the production pipeline compared to last year along with a land pipeline that will allow us to expand our community count throughout this year. We also have all the lots we need for our 2022 deliveries and expect to increase our full year gross margins by upwards of 250 basis points. In other words, we entered 2022 with tremendous momentum. While demand conditions are strong, the supply side of the equation has been extremely challenging with no clear signs as to when things will get better. The limited supply of new and existing homes allowed prices to increase by double digits last year, but labor shortages and significant disruptions in the supply chain are limiting production and extending build cycles. Our suppliers and partners are working hard to provide needed resources, but key products that are under allocation must be ordered months in advance or are simply not available. The ongoing surge in COVID infection rates is impacting our suppliers and is also making it very hard for trades to field crews consistently and expanding their teams is an even bigger challenge. Unfortunately, we expect construction processes to remain difficult through much, if not all, of 2022. In response to these challenges, we continue to implement actions to help ensure we can complete high quality homes and grow \u2013 [offer] (ph) deliveries until supply chain issues are resolved. These actions include increasing spec starts, ordering earlier, narrowing option packages and even warehousing inventory of critical building products. These efforts are time consuming and we lose some production efficiencies, but for the foreseeable future, they are required to get homes built. We've said in the past that scale, particularly local scale matters and this is certainly the case today. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As part of my review of our fourth quarter performance, I'll discuss our reported results and where appropriate review our results adjusted for specific items in the current or prior year quarter. Along with reviewing the company's fourth quarter results, I will also be providing guidance on key performance metrics for both the first quarter and full year 2022. Looking at the income statement. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter increased 38% over last year to $4.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 26% increase in closings to 8,611 homes, along with a 10% increase in average sales price to $490,000. The higher ASP in the quarter reflects double-digit pricing gains from all buyer groups, while closings came in slightly above guidance, thanks to the tremendous effort on the part of our homebuilding and financial services teams. Consistent with comments made throughout 2021, favorable supply and demand dynamics for housing supported the strong price appreciation we experienced across all markets and from all buyer groups. The mix of closings in the quarter were a direct alignment with our long-term goals and included 34% from first-time buyers, 42% from move-up buyers, and 24% from active adult buyers. Closings in the fourth quarter last year included 31% first time, 46% move up and 23% active adult. Net new orders in the quarter totaled 6,769 homes, which is a decrease of 4% from last year. The decrease in orders reflects a decrease in community count as well as the ongoing actions to manage sales to better align the pace of our sales and production that Ryan mentioned. Our average community count in the quarter was 785, which is down 7% from the prior year. Buyer demand was strong and order volumes were fairly consistent across all three months of the quarter as we didn't experience the typical seasonal drop-off in order volumes as we moved through the quarter. I would note that we continue to experience this strength in demand through January. By buyer group, orders by first-time buyers increased 12% to 2,207 homes, while orders by move-up and active adult buyers both declined 10% to 2,812 homes and 1,750 homes, respectively. The primary drivers of the lower order rates among the move up and active adult buyers was having fewer communities and our decision to restrict sales. We ended the fourth quarter with a large backlog of sold homes, which provides a strong base of production heading into the New Year. On a unit basis, our backlog at year-end was 18,003 homes, which is an increase of 19% over last year. Backlog value at year-end was $9.9 billion, which is an increase of 45% over 2020. Even with the well-documented challenges within the supply chain, I can say that thanks to a lot of hard work by our teams, trades and suppliers, we're getting homes into production. As a result, we ended the year with 18,423 homes under construction, which is up almost 50% over last year. I'm also pleased to report that we've been able to increase our spec production as 23% of homes under construction are spec. This is up from 17% in the third quarter and it's getting us closer to our target of having between 25% and 30% spec. While it's great to see homes getting into production, it's important to note that the overwhelming majority of these units are in the early stages of construction. More specifically, 31% of our production pipeline is at the initial start stage with another 44% of the homes only at the framing stage. At the other end of the production pipeline, we have only 411 finished homes. This figure includes both sold and spec units. Given the number of homes under production and equally important, their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 5,600 and 6,000 homes in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to the challenging production environment Ryan discussed, our Q1 delivery guide reflects the impact of limited finished spec inventory and the longer construction cycle times we're experiencing. For the full year 2022, we expect to deliver 31,000 homes. This estimate assumes no meaningful change in the state of the supply chain and in turn, our current cycle times. If the favorable demand conditions allow us to sell in an even higher year-over-year growth rate, we'll have to see if the supply of materials and labor will be equally supportive. Based on what occurred in 2021, we want to be confident we can deliver a high-quality and complete home at closing. If the supply of labor and materials does not allow for increased production, we'll continue to emphasize price over pace, restrict sales as needed as we focus on driving the best returns within each community. As we move through 2022, we are well positioned to meet buyer demand, given our expectations for sequential increases in our community count throughout the year. For the coming four quarters, we project our average community count to be 790 in Q1, 815 in Q2, 840 in Q3 and 870 in Q4. Given the land investments we've made, we expect this trend to continue and see further community count growth in 2023. As mentioned, strong demand and pricing conditions in 2021 resulted in higher prices across all buyer groups, which has resulted in our average sales price in backlog increasing by 22% compared to last year. Given the price of homes in backlog and the mix of homes we anticipate closing, we expect our average sales price to be between $500,000 and $510,000 in the first quarter. Our average sales price should move higher as we move through the year, and we currently expect our full year average sales price to be approximately $515,000. As always, the ultimate mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Driven by the strong price appreciation achieved throughout our markets, our homebuilding gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 180 basis points over last year and 30 basis points sequentially to 26.8%. With 18,000 homes in backlog, we have good visibility on near-term gross margins, but we also know that input costs are moving higher and that we expect to continue to incur what are now commonly called scramble costs, as we work to ensure product and labor availability. Based on what we can see today, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 29% in the first quarter and for the full year. This guide takes into consideration our current construction costs, as well as the recent run-up in lumber prices. Based on these factors, we anticipate being towards the bottom end of the range in the first quarter, but towards the higher end of the range by the end of the year. Speaking of inflation, we are closely monitoring increases that are impacting the cost of labor and materials. As a result, we currently expect house cost inflation exclusive of land costs of 6% to 8% for 2022. More than ever, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we'll update our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year. For the fourth quarter, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues includes a net pre-tax benefit of $23 million from adjustments to insurance- related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense was $280 million or 9.1% of wholesale revenues, excluding a $16 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance related reserves recorded in last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues. Looking at 2022 overheads, we currently expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.9%, which would be flat to down slightly from last year. For the full year, we expect SG&A expense to decrease as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% of home sale revenues as we realize incremental overhead leverage on the business. In the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $55 million. Prior year reported pre-tax income of $43 million included a $22 million pre-tax charge for adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves. During the fourth quarter, financial services pre-tax income was driven by increased loan production consistent with the growth in our homebuilding operations, offset by lower profitability per loan resulting from a more competitive market condition. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 85%, which is down slightly from last year's 86%. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $193 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.5%. Taxes in the fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $9 million, resulting from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. For 2022, we expect our tax rate to increase to 25%, driven by changes in certain underlying state tax rates and the fact that legislation to extend the energy tax credits beyond 2021 has not been passed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share and adjusted net income of $637 million or $2.51 per share. Prior year fourth quarter reported net income was $438 million or $1.62 per share with adjusted net income of $415 million or $1.53 per share. PulteGroup's earnings per share continue to benefit from our share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million common shares at a total cost of $283 million or an average price of $50.11 per share. For all of 2021, we repurchased 17.7 million shares, driving a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding at an average cost of $50.80 per share. For the year, we returned $897 million to shareholders through share repurchases, plus an additional $148 million of dividends. This brings the five-year total of share repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.2 billion. Having reduced our common shares outstanding by more than one-third over the past eight years, returning funds to shareholders has been a significant part of our capital allocation strategy. We fully expect such systematic repurchases to continue in the future, so we're extremely pleased with the Board -- announced today, approving a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization. At the end of 2021, we had $458 million remaining on the existing programs. Given our improving financial results and cash flows even after returning over $1 billion to shareholders, investing over $4 billion in our business, paying down $726 million of bonds during the year. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at year-end was 21.3%, which is a decrease of 820 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our net debt to capital ratio was 2.5%. As part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we have routinely talked about maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 30% to 40%. As noted in today's press release, we are updating these numbers to better reflect how our business operates today. Over the past several years, we have driven material and sustained gains in our operating performance and capital efficiency. These, in turn, have dramatically increased the cash flows we expect to generate. Taken in combination, we now believe we can grow our business and fund its operations while maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 20% to 30%. This represents confirmation that the changes we've driven in the business continue to support long-term growth. To further demonstrate this point, in the fourth quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of land acquisition and development. This brings our total land spend for 2021 to $4.2 billion. On paper, this is an increase of almost 50% over 2020 land spend. But I would remind you that we suspended land investment for almost six months when the pandemic first hit in 2020, so some of the 2021 spend was simply deferred for the prior year. We currently expect to increase our land investment in 2022 to between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. Given the vast majority of land we acquire is undeveloped, more than half of our spend in 2022 will be from the development of existing land assets. Supported by the higher land spend, we ended 2021 with 228,000 lots under control, of which 109,000 were owned and 119,000 were controlled through options. On a year-over-year basis, we ended 2021 with an incremental 30,000 lots under auction and remain focused on advancing our land life strategy going forward. I would note that included within our land position are approximately 1,400 lots that were approved under our strategic relationship with Invitation Homes and that we remain on track with our five-year plan of building 7,500 homes under this program with first closings expected in 2023. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. For a number of reasons, we remain constructive on the outlook for the housing industry. Earlier, I spoke about the large demographic trends, which are aligned to support buyer demand over the long-term. In the near-term, most economic indicators point to an ongoing expansion of the US economy, which should keep the job market strong and increase wages even further. We recognize that COVID and its various mutations are obviously a wildcard, but we hope that this latest surge may have already peaked and that conditions will begin to improve going forward. The impacts from COVID that don't appear to be waning are the desire for single-family living and the ability to work from home indefinitely. We are certainly mindful of rising interest rates and the potential risk through affordability and overall demand and are prepared to respond appropriately should conditions change. Still, given a strong economy, high employment and rising wages, this is a market environment in which we can sell homes. Before opening the call to questions, I do want to highlight an initiative that we've launched internally in 2020, but which you may begin hearing more about this year. Called our Hope to Home program, this is our effort to make available for sale more affordable housing and the possibility of homeownership to individuals who might not otherwise get the chance. We all know the benefits that homeownership can afford people over time, but we also can appreciate that not everyone has the same opportunity to access this path. We are beginning to pilot Hope to Home in a few communities and believe it's a program that could ultimately result in the sale of a couple of hundred homes a year. Hope to Home is a for-sale program designed to complement, but run independently of our highly successful build-to-honor program through which we donate mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans. Started in 2013, I'm extremely proud to say that Build to Honor will award its 75th mortgage-free home later this year. Now let me close as I begin by thanking our entire organization, as well as our suppliers and trade partners. You continue to prove yourselves to be an outstanding group of people focused on serving our customers and supporting each other.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Rob, if you'll explain the process, we'll get started with Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Nice results. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Mike.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Hi, Mike.\nMike Dahl: First question, just on the gross margin guide. It's great to see it up that much for the full year. It looks like it's up, but it's relatively stable through the year. Can you talk about some of the moving pieces? I mean, obviously, you've had some good sequential pricing. You talked about the full year for cost inflation. But can you talk about the moving pieces throughout the year that keep that guidance a little bit flatter through the year and maybe there's a difference in inflation per se versus second half however you want to kind of frame that?\nRyan Marshall: Sure, Mike. Obviously, inflation is real. And maybe principal among that interestingly is lumber, which had trended down we're getting a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year, but pricing has moved right back up. And so that's influenced the back half of the year. But I would tell you, you heard in the prepared remarks, we're projecting 6% to 8% increase in input costs for the house, plus kind of every new lot comes with a little bit more expensive cost than the ones that we just costed off, which is consistent with what you've seen for a couple of years now in a rising market, as we bring new assets to market, they're a little bit more expensive. So all those things factor in. The good news is that, as we look at the year, we do see margins improving through the year. So in the prepared remarks highlighted, we'll be at the lower end of the range in the first quarter and towards the higher end of the range. So despite those cost pressures, we think we're getting enough price to offset some of those increases. And margins at 28% to 29% -- 28.5%, 29% are pretty stout.\nMike Dahl: Sure. Okay. Thanks. Second question is around cash flow and capital allocation. I mean, it's nice to see the new details this morning. I guess, if we take into account your land investment, it will be up a little, but clearly your guide around income drivers are also up year-on-year. So, it seems like all is equal, cash from ops or free cash flow will be higher in 2022 than 2021. Since you're already in that 20% range or the lower end of that 20% range on gross debt to cap, should we think about effectively all of cash flow in the immediate term is going to be given back to shareholders via buybacks and dividends?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Mike, it's an interesting question. And the simple answer is I don't think so. We've long said that we've got sort of a priority cadence, invest in the business, pay our dividend, return excess to shareholders. And there are a lot of things that we could do with that money. So, I wouldn't want to say it would be restricted to any one thing. The land market, if it's attractive, you could see us investing. We've always told folks we look at M&A, so some money could end up there. So, the good news is, and you've heard this from us before, we're in a position where we have choices to make. You can see with the amount of money that we used to buy back stock in this quarter at $283 million, that's a step up from what we had done, brought the full year to almost $1 billion. The Board increased the authorization by $1 billion. We put that out this morning. So, if you add that to the $400 plus million we had at the end of the year, we've got a lot of capacity there, but we'll look at everything. And so, I wouldn't want to pigeonhole ourselves in the same, yet, it's all going back to shareholders. We'll use the same screen we always do in the business, it is going to be our primary driver as long as we can see an opportunity for higher return off of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nIvy Zelman: Thank you, and congratulations on a great year, guys.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Ivy.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks Ivy.\nIvy Zelman: Maybe, Ryan, you can help us a little bit just appreciating what you just said about with each asset you deliver, slightly higher costs. When you think about pre-COVID and your underwriting land, what are you underwriting in terms of absorption? And what are you underwriting what you're buying at, let's say, today, that might not deliver until 2023, 2024? Just to give us some perspective relative to the normal trend line. Let's start there.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Ivy, thanks for the question. And I would tell you that I think one of the things that has enabled us to deliver the results that we're delivering is a very consistent land underwriting screen that candidly hasn't changed through time. We're certainly underwriting at current market conditions, and we kind of have to do that in order to remain competitive. So the absorptions that we're underwriting communities at today are certainly a little bit higher than probably what we were underwriting land acquisitions at, say, three years ago. That being said, we're cognizant of the fact that absorptions over the last 12 to 15 months have been slightly higher than normal. And as I think some have said from time to time, trees don't grow to the sky. So we wouldn't necessarily expect that to continue in perpetuity. The thing that I would highlight, Ivy, is some of the things I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We think some of the structural changes that have occurred in buyer preferences for single-family living and perpetual work from home will continue to benefit this industry. We're also not in an oversupply environment and given some of the supply chain challenges that we've highlighted, we don't anticipate that changing anytime in the near future either. And then probably what I'd conclude on, the most important thing that I think we've structurally done as an organization is to integrate more optionality into our land pipeline. We're at north of 52% and over 119,000 lots that are controlled via option, which I think gives us tremendous flexibility, should there be a change in market conditions.\nIvy Zelman: No, that's really helpful. And maybe, Bob, in the future you can send us and follow-up sort of absorptions historically. I know we've embedded our data. But with mix shift, it's I don't know that it's a little bit higher, Ryan. Our market conditions right now are back to absorption per community just for the public companies is back to where it was during the great financial boom peak on a trend line basis, and that's even with restricting sales. But the cost inflation in land has been substantial. So maybe you can give us some perspective on how much of land that you're acquiring today, undeveloped draw land relative to what maybe you were thinking about from a baseline in 2019? And what are you paying if you are on finished lots, even if you're optioning, what is the outlook cost embedded in those acquisitions? And I'm done and thank you.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Ivy, that's a hard question to answer kind of apples-to-apples. I mean no two parcels are the same. Certainly, the market is pretty efficient. And as Ryan laid out for you, we are -- it's a competitive market, so we have to be competitive. So we make our bids and pricing based on what we see in terms of pricing that we can see in the market. What we think our cost to construct is and the ultimate return we can generate from the asset, and you're going to see different price appreciation in land in different parts of the country and for different buyer groups, honestly. So all those things would make it really challenging to blanket, say, pricing is up x percent. Suffice to say it is up. And it's one of the reasons I highlighted in that as part of our margin guide. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Good morning.\nAnthony Pettinari: I was wondering if you could talk about kind of credit metrics for your average buyer or your buyer types in terms of FICO or LTV. And then I think you indicated that rising rates you haven't really seen an impact to date? But I'm just wondering, as you look at previous hiking cycles, what you would anticipate in terms of behavior between your different buyer types or trading down market or maybe to more affordable offerings? Any comments you give?\nRyan Marshall: Sure, Anthony. Good morning. Thanks for the question. The credit metrics out of -- we obviously have visibility to the credit metrics as a whole from loans that are running through our mortgage operation. And they've largely remained unchanged for the last probably decade. The FICO scores that we see are north of 750. So incredibly strong credit. The loan-to-value ratio is very, very strong as well. So I think the credit metrics we're seeing from the buyers would indicate and maybe reiterate the financial strength that I think we've seen of personal balance sheet. So not a huge concern there, honestly. Bob, anything you'd add on any of the credit metrics that we've seen at this point?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Only that interestingly enough, even among our first-time buyers, if you look at them relative to the kind of the broader universe, we've got a higher mix of FICO scores even there. So interestingly, in a rising rate environment, history as a guide, the people we're selling to have that slightly higher price point have a little bit healthier balance sheet that folks that are just at the edge of qualifying.\nRyan Marshall: As far as rising rates go, Anthony, in our prepared remarks, we highlighted that we have not seen it impact demand, and I think a large part of that is because we've been restricting sales and because demand is outstripping supply. We are closely monitoring the impact of further increases in the 30-year mortgage and what that will ultimately do to affordability, but as we've said for a number of years, and we'll continue to talk about it, we do believe that, history as a guide, housing can be strong in a rising rate environment as long as the broader economy continues to show strength, which it is. We\u2019ve got historically low unemployment. We're seeing some real wage growth -- and I think those are -- and consumer confidence remains high. Those are things that I think will continue to prove -- will bode well for the industry, even against a backdrop of slightly higher rates. That being said, even with some increases in the 30-year mortgage, they're going to remain at historically really, really low rates, which we think is encouraging.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then in your comments, I think you stated you're not expecting supply chain size to ease over the course of the year. You talked about lumber. Can you talk about any other categories that are, I don't know, maybe getting worse versus getting better? And then there was a comment on potentially warehousing certain building products. And to the extent that you can, I don't know if you can talk about sort of the magnitude of that or what that looks like?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Anthony, we don't actually anticipate things to get better through 2022. So we've assumed that we'll continue to have a shortage of what we want in totality. And most of that's coming through either delays or allocations that we and frankly, the entire industry has been given from, from certain key supplies. I think there are some real bottlenecks in manpower availability due to COVID, so some of the factories that our supplies come out of are running at less than full capacity because of manpower issues. We're seeing less availability in terms of transportation in truck drivers. There was a shortage there to begin with, and then you factor in COVID, and that's just further exacerbated. And that -- those domino effects, I think we see flow through the entire supply chain. We are seeing some green shoots, and we have, over the last six months, kind of gone through some peaks and valleys where one particular supply seems to start getting better and lead times shorten only for things to go back to where they were. And so it's for that reason that we're not anticipating that we completely turned the corner and have a fixed supply chain in 2022. Just in terms of the items that we're seeing challenges with; roof trusses, appliances, sighting, paint to a certain degree. So things are pretty critical for us to build and deliver homes, cabinets is another one that I would tell you all the cabinets come out of factories where they've been challenged by historic high demand and manpower issues. So those are a few comments on the supply chain side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to go back to an earlier question around those -- I believe was trying to get around triangulating normalized gross margins, let's say, as you continue to buy land and to the extent that you're not going to have 10%, 15%, 20% home price appreciation over the next few years. If you look back into like 2017, 2018, you were doing 23% to 24% gross margins, which was at the higher end of our -- of the broader homebuilding sector. To the extent that home price appreciation normalizes, could you see a scenario over the next two to three years where given your current underwriting, you could get back of levels, which again, would still extensively be -- if there is a mean reversion, I would assume, still be at the higher level of the broader sector, or is there anything that's changed in how you're either approaching land, your own cost structure with greater scale or some of the improvements, et cetera, perhaps on the construction efforts that you're embarking upon that you could see kind of a slightly -- even slightly higher gross margin trend over time?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Hey, Mike, it's Ryan, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think I'd go back a decade ago when we really laid out a thesis around making investments to drive industry leading returns. And so I think the way you have seen us make investments in land, the way that we've managed debt, the way that we've allocated capital to share repurchases and dividends that has -- and frankly, the way that we've completely restructured our land ownership structure with so much being toward options, that's all been aimed at delivering top quartile, top tier returns. Margins are certainly a component of that, and it's long been part of our strategy to have leading margins. The thing that I would highlight, Mike, is that we're at 28.5% to 29% gross margins through the rest of 2022, which, as Bob highlighted, is pretty stout. And we're not giving any visibility beyond 2022, I think it\u2019s little early for that. But what you have seen from us is continuously a high and top-tier return on invested capital, and that's going to continue to be our focus. So what that yield in just this past year, we just finished with ROEs that are north of 28%. So we think the operating model that we have, Mike, can work in multiple market cycles. This one happens to be certainly particularly good.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. No, thank you for that, Ryan. I guess, secondly, just wanted to focus in on the community count growth. A nice trajectory that you've laid out for 2022. Based on the land book that you have, how should we think about community count growth and obviously, past 2022 and obviously not trying to get too granular and beyond what you're prepared to say in terms of formal guidance. But further this has been an area where, as I'm sure you know, people have expressed concerns around some of the growth on the community count side. Are we kind of turning a corner here where we could see perhaps a little bit more consistent growth going forward in this metric? Any thoughts around where we would go past the 870 at the end of 2022 would be pretty helpful for people?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question. It's Bob. We're not going to give you a guide for 2023. We did want to give a level of granularity more than we have for 2022 to show the sequencing that shows growth each quarter sequentially and ultimately, to a higher point at the end of the year. And in our prepared remarks, I actually said based on spending, we expect that to continue. Like every year, we'll give you a guide for 2023 as we approach 2023.\nRyan Marshall: Mike, the only thing I'd add into that is I think if you look at the trend of our land spend over the last three years, we've been a consistent investor in our land portfolio. And with 225,000 lots under control, those all turn into active communities. So we're pleased with what's coming into the pipeline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is open.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, everybody.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Carl.\nCarl Reichardt: One for you, Ryan. Hey, just on pricing strategy headed into the spring, I mean you got more demand than you can serve, costs are going up, but rates could come up and we know there's going to be more competition across the board from other builders and you've got more specs. So are you approaching pricing this spring, would you say, more conservatively than you have in past springs? And I know it's not necessarily a corporate and in Atlanta type of decision, perhaps it's more local. But maybe you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about pricing strategy given the crosscurrent?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Carl, it is more than local. It's probably hyper-local. All of our pricing decisions are made on a community-by-community basis. But that's a company philosophy. We've got very regimented pricing discipline in the way that we break down what the competitive set is, both from a resale and a new environment, both what's on the ground as well as what we see coming into the pipeline over the next six to 12 months. So I think the tools, the methodology, the proprietary pricing algorithms that we have, we think it served us very well, and we've gotten very good results from that. I think, Carl, we always try to be prudent in what we do and never get too far over our skis. I think, the industry has seen over the years, if you push things too far, the consumer will be pretty quick to tell you that you've gone too far and it will shut down. So in the face of potentially some more inventory coming online with some higher rates, we're going to continue to run our playbook, but take into consideration all the data that's available.\nCarl Reichardt: All right. Thank you, Ryan. And then, just a follow up on Ivy's question. If you look at the homes you plan to deliver in 2022, I'm assuming that effectively none of them are on lots that you bought post, say, the middle of 2020, so post pandemic land. When would you start to see the majority of your delivery volume be delivered on land you bought post pandemic or contracted for post-pandemic?\nRyan Marshall: Well, Carl, we're basically turning the majority of the land that we're buying. We're turning in about three years. So -- or when we buy it, we essentially are putting under contract about three years' worth of land. So a-third of that year one, a-third of that year two, a-third of that year three, so you've always got old land cycling out and new land cycling in. So there's never a time when you're going to have a complete fall off the cliff of the entire land book and a whole new land book comes on. There's always a mixing going on. Development timelines are elongated relative to historical as well. So land that -- from the time that we buy it, it's taken us 12 months, plus or minus, to get it fully developed and ready to start selling homes. So Carl, I think the simplest way that I can tell you is that, we always have new stuff coming in, we always have old stuff going out, and all that is factored into the guide that we've given certainly for 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. Really impressive results, and I know folks are excited about the guide, but I actually wanted to explore a few areas where it seems to me like your guidance could actually be incorporating a nice healthy dose of conservatism. And it's really around ASP volume and the implications of volume on margin. So if you look at your ASP, you guided, I think, for the full year, around 515. Your order ASP has been running at around 556, I think, for the past two quarters. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but just if that's the case, 515 seems kind of low for a closings number, ASP number. And then regarding your volume, I think you said 31,000 closings. And I know the cycle times is an issue out there, but it looks to me like you started over 34,000 in fiscal 2021 and even 8,200-or-so in fourth quarter. So although you're guiding as if there's no improvement in cycle time coming, it would seem that your actual -- what you're doing on the ground and what you did in terms of starts is leaving open the possibility that they will get better. Otherwise, I don't think you would have started that many in 4Q. And then if I'm right, that closings could actually do better than your guidance, won't you have some benefit on SG&A and scrambling cost? So that's like the general framework of my question. Let me ask this SG&A question specifically. If you do better than your guidance on closings, what is the incremental SG&A we should apply to those incremental revenues?\nRyan Marshall: Stephen, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think all of these things are related. So I'll do my best to kind of tie them together, and I'll ask for probably a little help from Bob at some point. In terms of ASP, Stephen, we've consciously been starting more spec. Most of the spec that we're starting is in our lower priced communities, specifically in our Centex first-time buyer communities where those price points are significantly lower. They will -- those will sell as specs later in the cycle, and so that's all been factored into the ASP guide that we've given. To your point about orders being at a higher price point over the last couple of quarters, that's largely been because we've been selling more of our Del Webb and our Pulte branded communities that come at a higher price point. So it's a fair question you've asked. I understand why you've asked it, but I think we factored in what we see are what we would expect to be our ultimate brand mix as we move throughout the year. In terms of the closing guide, Stephen, and what we started, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we've factored in what we've started, and we're very pleased with how much inventory have been able to put into the ground, both for sale and spec inventory. We've updated our delivery guide based on our current cycle time and what we anticipate to happen throughout the year with the supply chain. So I wouldn't probably go down the path of assuming that there's conservatism in that guide. I can tell you that if 2022 is anything like 2021, it was the hardest year of homebuilding that we've ever seen as an organization. And so we're going to stand firm on the 31,000 units that we've guided to. If things can improve, we'll all be thrilled.\nStephen Kim: For sure. Bob, what about that incremental SG&A ratio that we should be thinking about? And then just my only other question long term is your land supply in years. At some point, the pandemic will hopefully fade and I'm thinking five years out here, three, four, five years out, what level of land, what's the lower bound, lower range of years of land owned that Pulte can operate at? Is it like two years, because some of your competitors are running that low or approaching low? Could that be a level that you guys get to eventually once things have normalized in three to five years down the road?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, I think we've talked about the SG&A question before. And honestly, if you were to toggle the volume, which we wouldn't suggest, it is a -- look if we are -- if you're increasing volume, it is accretive to our overhead efficiency. I wouldn't want to put a percentage because it depends on how much volume you're talking about. But certainly, we would if we had more volume levers up the central overheads. Your selling costs don't change as a result of more volume. And then in terms of land supply, we've been consistent, honestly, since Ryan became the CEO that we're targeting three years owned, three years option. If you use a trailing 12-month volume, we're a little bit rich on that. If you look forward, it's more in line. It's hard to say where ultimately optionality could go. I think we would love to see it become a bigger part of our business as long as we can do it in a way that, for us, creates value, and that is, a, to be economically workable; and b, create true market risk. You won't see us creating optionality just to do optionality. So we will be seeking market -- some level of market protection from that, i.e., we can transaction if something changes. Again, I think very consistent from us, whether the developer base can get big enough to support a lower level of year's supply for us, time will tell. Certainly, if you look back over the last 40 or 50 years, there were points where the developers were active enough that the builders could take lots on it on a just-in-time basis, that developer base has not reestablished itself since the downturn in 2007, 2008 and 2009. If that happens, I think you'd see us participating.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one, maybe starting at a high level. We've been hearing that demand and foot traffic may have actually inflected positively in January. Just curious if that's consistent with what you guys have seen?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, it is, John. We're seeing really strong interest from buyers, and we think it's driven by some of the things we highlighted the desire from -- for a single-family living and the work from home trends continue. I would highlight not all the traffics on foot. I think our digital selling tools have probably advanced seven, eight years over the last 18 months, which I think is overall good for the business.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe drilling down just on the West region, in particular, deliveries declined slightly year-over-year versus pretty big gains in most other regions. Was this just a timing-related issue or is there something else to be thinking about there?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. It's really just community turnover, nothing to note, honestly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Just I had a couple of follow-ups from prior questions. But on some of the materials and labor supply chain challenges and what it means to cycle times? I'm just hoping to get some clarity. By the end of 2021, call it, November, December, have you actually started to see cycle times stabilize? And the reason I'm asking is outside of the recent flare with Omicron, what we've been hearing that builders largely become more efficient in working with the whack-a-mole environment and some had stabilized cycle times?\nRyan Marshall: Well, Truman, I think like any game, if you play it long enough, you certainly get better at it. And whack-a-mole is no different, but its still whack-a-mole for sure. What we've seen in our business, we've actually been able to take -- we've actually seen increased cycle times in the front half of the overall production cycle through kind of frame and windows stage, which has been really related to trust availability, framing labor, some of those kind of things and windows, candidly. We've been able to make up some time in the back half of the schedule. So there have been some pushes and pulls. But overall, it's been a net increase to cycle time. We've assumed that, that doesn't get any better in 2022, and that's all been factored into the guide that we've given.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, you all have mentioned some improvement in your new home inventory in 2022, recognizing all the constraints. But -- in this market, today, orders are really a function of inventory and production capabilities in my mind. I'm hoping that you might be able to give us an update on your expectations for starts in the first quarter? And whether or not your first quarter orders could inflect positive year-over-year on a pretty challenging comp based on your internal inventory capabilities? : Yeah, Truman, we don't guide or haven't guided on either one of those. And so probably, I'll stop short of giving you any additional insight. We do feel very good about what we have in the production pipeline. And I think we've demonstrated, really over the last nine months, a very predictable start cadence where we have been able to get volume into the ground, just taking longer for it to move through the overall production cycle. But again, that's been factored into our deliveries -- delivery guide for the year. The last thing that I'd really highlight on that note, Truman, is that, we\u2019ve got -- I think I said in my prepared -- well, I know I said in my prepared remarks, we've got double the amount of spec inventory. So it's something north of about 4,000 units, and that will certainly benefit us as we move through 2022.\nOperator: And we have reached our allotted time for questions. Mr. Zeumer, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Rob. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the course of the day for additional questions. Have a good rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. It's great to speak with you again and to have this opportunity to review PulteGroup's impressive fourth quarter and full year results. I am extremely proud of what our organization has been able to accomplish. For starters, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for the tremendous effort demonstrated throughout 2021, but particularly in the fourth quarter, from sales to procurement and construction, to our financial services team, you clearly showed what a proud and talented group of determined people can achieve. In a minute, Bob will review our fourth quarter results, but I want to highlight a few of our full year numbers to clearly demonstrate just how much success we've realized over the past 12 months. Even with all the challenges, the homebuilding industry faced in 2021, from supply chain disruptions and labor shortages to municipal delays and COVID waves, we grew our closings by 17% to almost 29,000 homes, benefiting from the very favorable demand and pricing conditions, we increased homebuilding revenues by an even greater 27% to $13.5 billion. We were then able to fully capitalize on this top line growth by expanding gross margins by 210 basis points to 26.4% and driving a 43% increase in our reported full year earnings of $7.43 per share. Our financial discussions tend to focus on the income statement, but I would also highlight that over the past 12 months, we lowered our debt to capital ratio to a historic low of 21.3%, while raising our return on equity to 28%. I would also highlight that over the course of 2021, we continued our disciplined allocation of capital in alignment with our stated priorities. This allocation included investing over $4 billion in land acquisition and land development, increasing our dividend pay rate per share in 2021 by 17%, retiring $726 million of bonds and repurchasing $900 million of stock, reducing our shares outstanding by approximately 6%. There is a lot to be excited about with regard to PulteGroup's 2021 operating and financial results. In assessing our performance, we fully appreciate that we benefited from a very favorable supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace. On the demand side, we saw a strong desire for homeownership across all markets and buyer groups. At one end, we have maturing millennials driving extraordinary demand for first-time and first-move of product, while at the other end, we have empty nesters who are downsizing or retiring into their next stage of life. This demand strength drove an increase of 8% in our 2021 net new orders to almost 32,000 homes, including 6,769 orders in the fourth quarter. The reality is that these numbers could have been significantly higher, but COVID and other challenges impacted our availability of lots, labor and materials, which caused us to intentionally slow sales. As part of our response strategy to these resource constraints, we raised prices in 2021 and actively restricted new home sales through lot releases or similar practices. We continue to implement these actions in the fourth quarter as we raised prices in effectively all our communities. At the same time, we continue to restrict sales in more than half of our communities. The strong demand experienced in the fourth quarter has continued into January with no signs that higher interest rates are impacting the desire for new homes. As we look forward to the year ahead, we are well-positioned to meet the strong demand. We entered 2022 with twice as many spec homes in the production pipeline compared to last year along with a land pipeline that will allow us to expand our community count throughout this year. We also have all the lots we need for our 2022 deliveries and expect to increase our full year gross margins by upwards of 250 basis points. In other words, we entered 2022 with tremendous momentum. While demand conditions are strong, the supply side of the equation has been extremely challenging with no clear signs as to when things will get better. The limited supply of new and existing homes allowed prices to increase by double digits last year, but labor shortages and significant disruptions in the supply chain are limiting production and extending build cycles. Our suppliers and partners are working hard to provide needed resources, but key products that are under allocation must be ordered months in advance or are simply not available. The ongoing surge in COVID infection rates is impacting our suppliers and is also making it very hard for trades to field crews consistently and expanding their teams is an even bigger challenge. Unfortunately, we expect construction processes to remain difficult through much, if not all, of 2022. In response to these challenges, we continue to implement actions to help ensure we can complete high quality homes and grow \u2013 [offer] (ph) deliveries until supply chain issues are resolved. These actions include increasing spec starts, ordering earlier, narrowing option packages and even warehousing inventory of critical building products. These efforts are time consuming and we lose some production efficiencies, but for the foreseeable future, they are required to get homes built. We've said in the past that scale, particularly local scale matters and this is certainly the case today. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Thanks, Bob. For a number of reasons, we remain constructive on the outlook for the housing industry. Earlier, I spoke about the large demographic trends, which are aligned to support buyer demand over the long-term. In the near-term, most economic indicators point to an ongoing expansion of the US economy, which should keep the job market strong and increase wages even further. We recognize that COVID and its various mutations are obviously a wildcard, but we hope that this latest surge may have already peaked and that conditions will begin to improve going forward. The impacts from COVID that don't appear to be waning are the desire for single-family living and the ability to work from home indefinitely. We are certainly mindful of rising interest rates and the potential risk through affordability and overall demand and are prepared to respond appropriately should conditions change. Still, given a strong economy, high employment and rising wages, this is a market environment in which we can sell homes. Before opening the call to questions, I do want to highlight an initiative that we've launched internally in 2020, but which you may begin hearing more about this year. Called our Hope to Home program, this is our effort to make available for sale more affordable housing and the possibility of homeownership to individuals who might not otherwise get the chance. We all know the benefits that homeownership can afford people over time, but we also can appreciate that not everyone has the same opportunity to access this path. We are beginning to pilot Hope to Home in a few communities and believe it's a program that could ultimately result in the sale of a couple of hundred homes a year. Hope to Home is a for-sale program designed to complement, but run independently of our highly successful build-to-honor program through which we donate mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans. Started in 2013, I'm extremely proud to say that Build to Honor will award its 75th mortgage-free home later this year. Now let me close as I begin by thanking our entire organization, as well as our suppliers and trade partners. You continue to prove yourselves to be an outstanding group of people focused on serving our customers and supporting each other. Hi, Mike. Sure, Mike. Obviously, inflation is real. And maybe principal among that interestingly is lumber, which had trended down we're getting a little bit of a tailwind in the first half of the year, but pricing has moved right back up. And so that's influenced the back half of the year. But I would tell you, you heard in the prepared remarks, we're projecting 6% to 8% increase in input costs for the house, plus kind of every new lot comes with a little bit more expensive cost than the ones that we just costed off, which is consistent with what you've seen for a couple of years now in a rising market, as we bring new assets to market, they're a little bit more expensive. So all those things factor in. The good news is that, as we look at the year, we do see margins improving through the year. So in the prepared remarks highlighted, we'll be at the lower end of the range in the first quarter and towards the higher end of the range. So despite those cost pressures, we think we're getting enough price to offset some of those increases. And margins at 28% to 29% -- 28.5%, 29% are pretty stout. Yeah, Mike, it's an interesting question. And the simple answer is I don't think so. We've long said that we've got sort of a priority cadence, invest in the business, pay our dividend, return excess to shareholders. And there are a lot of things that we could do with that money. So, I wouldn't want to say it would be restricted to any one thing. The land market, if it's attractive, you could see us investing. We've always told folks we look at M&A, so some money could end up there. So, the good news is, and you've heard this from us before, we're in a position where we have choices to make. You can see with the amount of money that we used to buy back stock in this quarter at $283 million, that's a step up from what we had done, brought the full year to almost $1 billion. The Board increased the authorization by $1 billion. We put that out this morning. So, if you add that to the $400 plus million we had at the end of the year, we've got a lot of capacity there, but we'll look at everything. And so, I wouldn't want to pigeonhole ourselves in the same, yet, it's all going back to shareholders. We'll use the same screen we always do in the business, it is going to be our primary driver as long as we can see an opportunity for higher return off of it. Thanks Ivy. Yeah, Ivy, thanks for the question. And I would tell you that I think one of the things that has enabled us to deliver the results that we're delivering is a very consistent land underwriting screen that candidly hasn't changed through time. We're certainly underwriting at current market conditions, and we kind of have to do that in order to remain competitive. So the absorptions that we're underwriting communities at today are certainly a little bit higher than probably what we were underwriting land acquisitions at, say, three years ago. That being said, we're cognizant of the fact that absorptions over the last 12 to 15 months have been slightly higher than normal. And as I think some have said from time to time, trees don't grow to the sky. So we wouldn't necessarily expect that to continue in perpetuity. The thing that I would highlight, Ivy, is some of the things I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We think some of the structural changes that have occurred in buyer preferences for single-family living and perpetual work from home will continue to benefit this industry. We're also not in an oversupply environment and given some of the supply chain challenges that we've highlighted, we don't anticipate that changing anytime in the near future either. And then probably what I'd conclude on, the most important thing that I think we've structurally done as an organization is to integrate more optionality into our land pipeline. We're at north of 52% and over 119,000 lots that are controlled via option, which I think gives us tremendous flexibility, should there be a change in market conditions. Sure, Anthony. Good morning. Thanks for the question. The credit metrics out of -- we obviously have visibility to the credit metrics as a whole from loans that are running through our mortgage operation. And they've largely remained unchanged for the last probably decade. The FICO scores that we see are north of 750. So incredibly strong credit. The loan-to-value ratio is very, very strong as well. So I think the credit metrics we're seeing from the buyers would indicate and maybe reiterate the financial strength that I think we've seen of personal balance sheet. So not a huge concern there, honestly. Bob, anything you'd add on any of the credit metrics that we've seen at this point? As far as rising rates go, Anthony, in our prepared remarks, we highlighted that we have not seen it impact demand, and I think a large part of that is because we've been restricting sales and because demand is outstripping supply. We are closely monitoring the impact of further increases in the 30-year mortgage and what that will ultimately do to affordability, but as we've said for a number of years, and we'll continue to talk about it, we do believe that, history as a guide, housing can be strong in a rising rate environment as long as the broader economy continues to show strength, which it is. We've got historically low unemployment. We're seeing some real wage growth -- and I think those are -- and consumer confidence remains high. Those are things that I think will continue to prove -- will bode well for the industry, even against a backdrop of slightly higher rates. That being said, even with some increases in the 30-year mortgage, they're going to remain at historically really, really low rates, which we think is encouraging. Yeah. Anthony, we don't actually anticipate things to get better through 2022. So we've assumed that we'll continue to have a shortage of what we want in totality. And most of that's coming through either delays or allocations that we and frankly, the entire industry has been given from, from certain key supplies. I think there are some real bottlenecks in manpower availability due to COVID, so some of the factories that our supplies come out of are running at less than full capacity because of manpower issues. We're seeing less availability in terms of transportation in truck drivers. There was a shortage there to begin with, and then you factor in COVID, and that's just further exacerbated. And that -- those domino effects, I think we see flow through the entire supply chain. We are seeing some green shoots, and we have, over the last six months, kind of gone through some peaks and valleys where one particular supply seems to start getting better and lead times shorten only for things to go back to where they were. And so it's for that reason that we're not anticipating that we completely turned the corner and have a fixed supply chain in 2022. Just in terms of the items that we're seeing challenges with; roof trusses, appliances, sighting, paint to a certain degree. So things are pretty critical for us to build and deliver homes, cabinets is another one that I would tell you all the cabinets come out of factories where they've been challenged by historic high demand and manpower issues. So those are a few comments on the supply chain side. Yeah. Hey, Mike, it's Ryan, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think I'd go back a decade ago when we really laid out a thesis around making investments to drive industry leading returns. And so I think the way you have seen us make investments in land, the way that we've managed debt, the way that we've allocated capital to share repurchases and dividends that has -- and frankly, the way that we've completely restructured our land ownership structure with so much being toward options, that's all been aimed at delivering top quartile, top tier returns. Margins are certainly a component of that, and it's long been part of our strategy to have leading margins. The thing that I would highlight, Mike, is that we're at 28.5% to 29% gross margins through the rest of 2022, which, as Bob highlighted, is pretty stout. And we're not giving any visibility beyond 2022, I think it's little early for that. But what you have seen from us is continuously a high and top-tier return on invested capital, and that's going to continue to be our focus. So what that yield in just this past year, we just finished with ROEs that are north of 28%. So we think the operating model that we have, Mike, can work in multiple market cycles. This one happens to be certainly particularly good. Mike, the only thing I'd add into that is I think if you look at the trend of our land spend over the last three years, we've been a consistent investor in our land portfolio. And with 225,000 lots under control, those all turn into active communities. So we're pleased with what's coming into the pipeline. Hi, Carl. Yes. Carl, it is more than local. It's probably hyper-local. All of our pricing decisions are made on a community-by-community basis. But that's a company philosophy. We've got very regimented pricing discipline in the way that we break down what the competitive set is, both from a resale and a new environment, both what's on the ground as well as what we see coming into the pipeline over the next six to 12 months. So I think the tools, the methodology, the proprietary pricing algorithms that we have, we think it served us very well, and we've gotten very good results from that. I think, Carl, we always try to be prudent in what we do and never get too far over our skis. I think, the industry has seen over the years, if you push things too far, the consumer will be pretty quick to tell you that you've gone too far and it will shut down. So in the face of potentially some more inventory coming online with some higher rates, we're going to continue to run our playbook, but take into consideration all the data that's available. Well, Carl, we're basically turning the majority of the land that we're buying. We're turning in about three years. So -- or when we buy it, we essentially are putting under contract about three years' worth of land. So a-third of that year one, a-third of that year two, a-third of that year three, so you've always got old land cycling out and new land cycling in. So there's never a time when you're going to have a complete fall off the cliff of the entire land book and a whole new land book comes on. There's always a mixing going on. Development timelines are elongated relative to historical as well. So land that -- from the time that we buy it, it's taken us 12 months, plus or minus, to get it fully developed and ready to start selling homes. So Carl, I think the simplest way that I can tell you is that, we always have new stuff coming in, we always have old stuff going out, and all that is factored into the guide that we've given certainly for 2022. Stephen, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think all of these things are related. So I'll do my best to kind of tie them together, and I'll ask for probably a little help from Bob at some point. In terms of ASP, Stephen, we've consciously been starting more spec. Most of the spec that we're starting is in our lower priced communities, specifically in our Centex first-time buyer communities where those price points are significantly lower. They will -- those will sell as specs later in the cycle, and so that's all been factored into the ASP guide that we've given. To your point about orders being at a higher price point over the last couple of quarters, that's largely been because we've been selling more of our Del Webb and our Pulte branded communities that come at a higher price point. So it's a fair question you've asked. I understand why you've asked it, but I think we factored in what we see are what we would expect to be our ultimate brand mix as we move throughout the year. In terms of the closing guide, Stephen, and what we started, as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we've factored in what we've started, and we're very pleased with how much inventory have been able to put into the ground, both for sale and spec inventory. We've updated our delivery guide based on our current cycle time and what we anticipate to happen throughout the year with the supply chain. So I wouldn't probably go down the path of assuming that there's conservatism in that guide. I can tell you that if 2022 is anything like 2021, it was the hardest year of homebuilding that we've ever seen as an organization. And so we're going to stand firm on the 31,000 units that we've guided to. If things can improve, we'll all be thrilled. Yes, it is, John. We're seeing really strong interest from buyers, and we think it's driven by some of the things we highlighted the desire from -- for a single-family living and the work from home trends continue. I would highlight not all the traffics on foot. I think our digital selling tools have probably advanced seven, eight years over the last 18 months, which I think is overall good for the business. Yes. It's really just community turnover, nothing to note, honestly. Well, Truman, I think like any game, if you play it long enough, you certainly get better at it. And whack-a-mole is no different, but its still whack-a-mole for sure. What we've seen in our business, we've actually been able to take -- we've actually seen increased cycle times in the front half of the overall production cycle through kind of frame and windows stage, which has been really related to trust availability, framing labor, some of those kind of things and windows, candidly. We've been able to make up some time in the back half of the schedule. So there have been some pushes and pulls. But overall, it's been a net increase to cycle time. We've assumed that, that doesn't get any better in 2022, and that's all been factored into the guide that we've given."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As part of my review of our fourth quarter performance, I'll discuss our reported results and where appropriate review our results adjusted for specific items in the current or prior year quarter. Along with reviewing the company's fourth quarter results, I will also be providing guidance on key performance metrics for both the first quarter and full year 2022. Looking at the income statement. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter increased 38% over last year to $4.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 26% increase in closings to 8,611 homes, along with a 10% increase in average sales price to $490,000. The higher ASP in the quarter reflects double-digit pricing gains from all buyer groups, while closings came in slightly above guidance, thanks to the tremendous effort on the part of our homebuilding and financial services teams. Consistent with comments made throughout 2021, favorable supply and demand dynamics for housing supported the strong price appreciation we experienced across all markets and from all buyer groups. The mix of closings in the quarter were a direct alignment with our long-term goals and included 34% from first-time buyers, 42% from move-up buyers, and 24% from active adult buyers. Closings in the fourth quarter last year included 31% first time, 46% move up and 23% active adult. Net new orders in the quarter totaled 6,769 homes, which is a decrease of 4% from last year. The decrease in orders reflects a decrease in community count as well as the ongoing actions to manage sales to better align the pace of our sales and production that Ryan mentioned. Our average community count in the quarter was 785, which is down 7% from the prior year. Buyer demand was strong and order volumes were fairly consistent across all three months of the quarter as we didn't experience the typical seasonal drop-off in order volumes as we moved through the quarter. I would note that we continue to experience this strength in demand through January. By buyer group, orders by first-time buyers increased 12% to 2,207 homes, while orders by move-up and active adult buyers both declined 10% to 2,812 homes and 1,750 homes, respectively. The primary drivers of the lower order rates among the move up and active adult buyers was having fewer communities and our decision to restrict sales. We ended the fourth quarter with a large backlog of sold homes, which provides a strong base of production heading into the New Year. On a unit basis, our backlog at year-end was 18,003 homes, which is an increase of 19% over last year. Backlog value at year-end was $9.9 billion, which is an increase of 45% over 2020. Even with the well-documented challenges within the supply chain, I can say that thanks to a lot of hard work by our teams, trades and suppliers, we're getting homes into production. As a result, we ended the year with 18,423 homes under construction, which is up almost 50% over last year. I'm also pleased to report that we've been able to increase our spec production as 23% of homes under construction are spec. This is up from 17% in the third quarter and it's getting us closer to our target of having between 25% and 30% spec. While it's great to see homes getting into production, it's important to note that the overwhelming majority of these units are in the early stages of construction. More specifically, 31% of our production pipeline is at the initial start stage with another 44% of the homes only at the framing stage. At the other end of the production pipeline, we have only 411 finished homes. This figure includes both sold and spec units. Given the number of homes under production and equally important, their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 5,600 and 6,000 homes in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to the challenging production environment Ryan discussed, our Q1 delivery guide reflects the impact of limited finished spec inventory and the longer construction cycle times we're experiencing. For the full year 2022, we expect to deliver 31,000 homes. This estimate assumes no meaningful change in the state of the supply chain and in turn, our current cycle times. If the favorable demand conditions allow us to sell in an even higher year-over-year growth rate, we'll have to see if the supply of materials and labor will be equally supportive. Based on what occurred in 2021, we want to be confident we can deliver a high-quality and complete home at closing. If the supply of labor and materials does not allow for increased production, we'll continue to emphasize price over pace, restrict sales as needed as we focus on driving the best returns within each community. As we move through 2022, we are well positioned to meet buyer demand, given our expectations for sequential increases in our community count throughout the year. For the coming four quarters, we project our average community count to be 790 in Q1, 815 in Q2, 840 in Q3 and 870 in Q4. Given the land investments we've made, we expect this trend to continue and see further community count growth in 2023. As mentioned, strong demand and pricing conditions in 2021 resulted in higher prices across all buyer groups, which has resulted in our average sales price in backlog increasing by 22% compared to last year. Given the price of homes in backlog and the mix of homes we anticipate closing, we expect our average sales price to be between $500,000 and $510,000 in the first quarter. Our average sales price should move higher as we move through the year, and we currently expect our full year average sales price to be approximately $515,000. As always, the ultimate mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Driven by the strong price appreciation achieved throughout our markets, our homebuilding gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 180 basis points over last year and 30 basis points sequentially to 26.8%. With 18,000 homes in backlog, we have good visibility on near-term gross margins, but we also know that input costs are moving higher and that we expect to continue to incur what are now commonly called scramble costs, as we work to ensure product and labor availability. Based on what we can see today, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 29% in the first quarter and for the full year. This guide takes into consideration our current construction costs, as well as the recent run-up in lumber prices. Based on these factors, we anticipate being towards the bottom end of the range in the first quarter, but towards the higher end of the range by the end of the year. Speaking of inflation, we are closely monitoring increases that are impacting the cost of labor and materials. As a result, we currently expect house cost inflation exclusive of land costs of 6% to 8% for 2022. More than ever, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we'll update our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year. For the fourth quarter, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues includes a net pre-tax benefit of $23 million from adjustments to insurance- related reserves recorded in the fourth quarter. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense was $280 million or 9.1% of wholesale revenues, excluding a $16 million net pre-tax benefit from adjustments to insurance related reserves recorded in last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted SG&A expense was $296 million or 9.7% of home sale revenues. Looking at 2022 overheads, we currently expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be in the range of 10.7% to 10.9%, which would be flat to down slightly from last year. For the full year, we expect SG&A expense to decrease as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% of home sale revenues as we realize incremental overhead leverage on the business. In the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $55 million. Prior year reported pre-tax income of $43 million included a $22 million pre-tax charge for adjustments to our mortgage origination reserves. During the fourth quarter, financial services pre-tax income was driven by increased loan production consistent with the growth in our homebuilding operations, offset by lower profitability per loan resulting from a more competitive market condition. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 85%, which is down slightly from last year's 86%. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $193 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.5%. Taxes in the fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $9 million, resulting from deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. For 2022, we expect our tax rate to increase to 25%, driven by changes in certain underlying state tax rates and the fact that legislation to extend the energy tax credits beyond 2021 has not been passed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share and adjusted net income of $637 million or $2.51 per share. Prior year fourth quarter reported net income was $438 million or $1.62 per share with adjusted net income of $415 million or $1.53 per share. PulteGroup's earnings per share continue to benefit from our share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million common shares at a total cost of $283 million or an average price of $50.11 per share. For all of 2021, we repurchased 17.7 million shares, driving a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding at an average cost of $50.80 per share. For the year, we returned $897 million to shareholders through share repurchases, plus an additional $148 million of dividends. This brings the five-year total of share repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.2 billion. Having reduced our common shares outstanding by more than one-third over the past eight years, returning funds to shareholders has been a significant part of our capital allocation strategy. We fully expect such systematic repurchases to continue in the future, so we're extremely pleased with the Board -- announced today, approving a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization. At the end of 2021, we had $458 million remaining on the existing programs. Given our improving financial results and cash flows even after returning over $1 billion to shareholders, investing over $4 billion in our business, paying down $726 million of bonds during the year. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash. Our debt-to-total capital ratio at year-end was 21.3%, which is a decrease of 820 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our net debt to capital ratio was 2.5%. As part of our overall capital allocation strategy, we have routinely talked about maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 30% to 40%. As noted in today's press release, we are updating these numbers to better reflect how our business operates today. Over the past several years, we have driven material and sustained gains in our operating performance and capital efficiency. These, in turn, have dramatically increased the cash flows we expect to generate. Taken in combination, we now believe we can grow our business and fund its operations while maintaining our gross debt-to-capital ratio in the range of 20% to 30%. This represents confirmation that the changes we've driven in the business continue to support long-term growth. To further demonstrate this point, in the fourth quarter, we invested $1.4 billion of land acquisition and development. This brings our total land spend for 2021 to $4.2 billion. On paper, this is an increase of almost 50% over 2020 land spend. But I would remind you that we suspended land investment for almost six months when the pandemic first hit in 2020, so some of the 2021 spend was simply deferred for the prior year. We currently expect to increase our land investment in 2022 to between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. Given the vast majority of land we acquire is undeveloped, more than half of our spend in 2022 will be from the development of existing land assets. Supported by the higher land spend, we ended 2021 with 228,000 lots under control, of which 109,000 were owned and 119,000 were controlled through options. On a year-over-year basis, we ended 2021 with an incremental 30,000 lots under auction and remain focused on advancing our land life strategy going forward. I would note that included within our land position are approximately 1,400 lots that were approved under our strategic relationship with Invitation Homes and that we remain on track with our five-year plan of building 7,500 homes under this program with first closings expected in 2023. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Hi, Mike. Thanks Ivy. Yes. Ivy, that's a hard question to answer kind of apples-to-apples. I mean no two parcels are the same. Certainly, the market is pretty efficient. And as Ryan laid out for you, we are -- it's a competitive market, so we have to be competitive. So we make our bids and pricing based on what we see in terms of pricing that we can see in the market. What we think our cost to construct is and the ultimate return we can generate from the asset, and you're going to see different price appreciation in land in different parts of the country and for different buyer groups, honestly. So all those things would make it really challenging to blanket, say, pricing is up x percent. Suffice to say it is up. And it's one of the reasons I highlighted in that as part of our margin guide. Hopefully, that answers your question. Good morning. Only that interestingly enough, even among our first-time buyers, if you look at them relative to the kind of the broader universe, we've got a higher mix of FICO scores even there. So interestingly, in a rising rate environment, history as a guide, the people we're selling to have that slightly higher price point have a little bit healthier balance sheet that folks that are just at the edge of qualifying. Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question. It's Bob. We're not going to give you a guide for 2023. We did want to give a level of granularity more than we have for 2022 to show the sequencing that shows growth each quarter sequentially and ultimately, to a higher point at the end of the year. And in our prepared remarks, I actually said based on spending, we expect that to continue. Like every year, we'll give you a guide for 2023 as we approach 2023. Yes, Stephen, I think we've talked about the SG&A question before. And honestly, if you were to toggle the volume, which we wouldn't suggest, it is a -- look if we are -- if you're increasing volume, it is accretive to our overhead efficiency. I wouldn't want to put a percentage because it depends on how much volume you're talking about. But certainly, we would if we had more volume levers up the central overheads. Your selling costs don't change as a result of more volume. And then in terms of land supply, we've been consistent, honestly, since Ryan became the CEO that we're targeting three years owned, three years option. If you use a trailing 12-month volume, we're a little bit rich on that. If you look forward, it's more in line. It's hard to say where ultimately optionality could go. I think we would love to see it become a bigger part of our business as long as we can do it in a way that, for us, creates value, and that is, a, to be economically workable; and b, create true market risk. You won't see us creating optionality just to do optionality. So we will be seeking market -- some level of market protection from that, i.e., we can transaction if something changes. Again, I think very consistent from us, whether the developer base can get big enough to support a lower level of year's supply for us, time will tell. Certainly, if you look back over the last 40 or 50 years, there were points where the developers were active enough that the builders could take lots on it on a just-in-time basis, that developer base has not reestablished itself since the downturn in 2007, 2008 and 2009. If that happens, I think you'd see us participating."

In this morning's press release, you read that our home sale revenues in the third quarter increased by 18% over last year to $3.3 billion, while our gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 26.5%. In combination, top line growth and margin expansion helped drive higher earnings per share of $1.82. This is an increase of 36% over the prior year's third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share. Inclusive of these strong third quarter numbers through the first 9 months of 2021, our home sale revenues were up 22% to $9.2 billion while our reported earnings per share are up 36% to $4.85. The resulting strong cash flow being generated by our operations continues to put our company in an enviable position in which we can invest in our business, return funds to shareholders and still maintain outstanding balance sheet strength and overall liquidity.  More specifically, consistent with our constructive view on the housing market, we have invested $2.9 billion in land acquisition and development so far this year. Our $2.9 billion of land spend is comparable to what we invested for the full year in both 2020 and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, and we remain fully on track to invest approximately $4 billion in total for the full year of 2021.  I would highlight that while we are investing more into the business, we remain disciplined and focused on building a more efficient and lower-risk land pipeline. At the end of the third quarter, our lots under option had grown to 54% of our total controlled lot position compared to when I set the initial 50% option target, we have over 65,000 more lots under option and now view 50% as the floor rather than the ceiling in terms of how we control our land assets.  Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, along with investing $948 million more in land acquisition and development through the first 9 months of 2021 compared with last year, we have also returned $726 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have paid off nearly $800 million in debt this year, leaving us with a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 5.7%. Finally, consistent with our strategic focus, our operating and financial performance has helped drive a return on equity of 26% for the trailing 12 months.  Just like the broader economy, our operations continue to be impacted by the pandemic. On one hand, we are managing through the disruptions COVID-19 and the Delta variant have inflicted on our workforce, our trade partners and the global supply chain. On the other hand, our results have certainly benefited from the remarkable demand and pricing environment the homebuilding industry has experienced over the past 18 months. Either way, to deliver our third quarter numbers during the global pandemic and with a supply chain that is clearly struggling reflects the commitment and tireless efforts of the entire PulteGroup team.  Since we updated our production guidance in early September, broader industry comments have validated the challenges within the construction supply chain are significant and don't have any quick fixes. Based on a myriad of calls and questions we have received, I think it's hard for everyone to appreciate the full magnitude of the issues we're facing when you're not dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. For some products, it's simply the materials aren't available. Sometimes you can switch to an alternative. But when you can, you wait. For others, it's changing lead times where order fulfillment has gone from 6 weeks to 16 weeks, back to 11 weeks and then back to 16 weeks. And for others, it's seeing allocations being imposed as manufacturers and distributors do their best to keep their major customers, which I would note we are one, at least partially satisfied. Our local divisions may not get much advanced notice of the shortage resulting allocations so we have to adjust on the fly.  In other cases, it's logistics. When you're forced to ship materials to solve near-term issues, this might be shipping siding from the Southeast to the Southwest or our trades driving across the state for paint. In one form or another, these issues impacted our third quarter results and, as Bob will detail, will put additional pressure on our deliveries and margins in the fourth quarter. As difficult and frustrating as this is, I can say that our suppliers have been outstanding partners and routinely bend over backwards to get us the materials we need to solve our issues.  I can say that we've been clear with our teams that we have to be -- that we have to overcommunicate with customers to keep them informed of any schedule changes. We also have to be flexible and creative in sourcing materials even if this means spending additional dollars to acquire needed resources. And finally, we must maintain our standards on the quality and completeness of each home that we deliver. Given the very problems impacting the supply chain, we would expect a solution that -- we would expect that solutions will be found over different time lines, depending on the suppliers' underlying issue. In the interim, we will adjust our production estimates for the fourth quarter and work to position the business for more consistent cadence in the year ahead. We will also continue to work in close partnership with our suppliers to manage through the supply chain issues as quickly and as intelligently as possible.  Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our third quarter results.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating through the challenging production environment, which can be seen in the exceptional operating and financial results we delivered in the quarter.  Starting with our income statement. Our home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 18% over last year to $3.3 billion. The increase in revenues was driven by a 9% increase in closings to 7,007 homes in combination with an 8% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $474,000. The higher average sales price realized in the third quarter reflects meaningful price increases we've realized across all buyer groups, with first-time up 8%, move-up up 10% and active adult up 8%. The mix of homes we delivered in the third quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 44% from move-up buyers and 24% from active adult buyers. In last year's third quarter, 30% of homes delivered were first-time, 45% were move-up and 25% were active adult.  Our net new orders for the third quarter were 6,796 homes, which represents a 17% decrease from last year that was driven primarily by a 14% decline in year-over-year community count. In addition to fewer open communities, orders for the period were impacted by ongoing actions to manage sales paces to better align with current production volumes. The actions to manage sales pace and outright restrict sales were more frequently targeted toward our first-time buyer communities as we strategically work to build up spec inventory within our Centex branded communities.  Looking at our third quarter orders in a little more detail. Our orders from first-time buyers decreased 20% compared with last year. This decrease was driven primarily by our actions to restrict sales as our first-time community count was only down 6% compared with last year. In contrast, our orders from move-up and active adult buyers decreased 22% and 4%, respectively, which was driven by comparable 22% and 5% decreases in community count, respectively.  In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 768 communities. Consistent with the guide in our recent market update, this is down 14% from last year's average of 892 communities. Our Q3 community count should be the low watermark for the year as we expect our fourth quarter community count to increase to approximately 775 active communities.  Further, our existing land pipeline should allow us to realize a meaningful ramp-up in community count as we move through 2022. As is our practice, we will provide more specifics on 2022 community count as part of our fourth quarter earnings call.  Our unit backlog at the end of the third quarter was up 33% over last year to 19,845 homes. The dollar value of our backlog increased an even greater 56% to $10.3 billion as we benefited from robust price increases realized over the course of this year. At the end of the third quarter, we had 18,802 homes under construction, of which 83% were sold and 17% re-spec. We have almost 900 more spec homes in production than we did in the second quarter as we have been working to increase spec availability, particularly in our Centex communities. In many instances, this has meant tightly controlling current period order rates, but we feel this is the appropriate action as we seek to better align our sales with the current pace of production.  Given that 90% of our specs are early in the construction cycle and we have only 109 finished specs, these units are about helping to position the company for 2022, rather than providing closings in 2021. We faced similar dynamics within our production of sold units as 2/3 of these homes are in the earlier stages of construction, and we can see gaps in the supply of key building products needed to complete these homes. Given these conditions, we believe it appropriate to update our fourth quarter guide for expected fourth quarter deliveries and currently expect to deliver approximately 8,500 homes in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 24% over the fourth quarter of last year.  It's difficult to say there are positives to be gleaned from the challenging production environment, but one of the outcomes is that the limited supply of homes, coupled with ongoing strong demand, has supported higher prices across the market. Reflective of these conditions, our average price in backlog increased 18% or $78,000 over last year to $519,000. Although more than half of our quarter end backlog is expected to deliver in 2022, we will continue to see the benefit of rising prices in our fourth quarter as our average closing price is expected to be $485,000 to $490,000. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of approximately 10% over last year.  Our reported homebuilding gross margin in the third quarter increased 200 basis points over last year to 26.5%. Given that our third quarter closings absorbed the elevated lumber prices from earlier this year, expanding our gross margin by 200 basis points attest to the strong pricing environment the industry experienced over the past year. It's worth noting that the strong market conditions also contributed to another step down in incentives in the period as discounts fell to 1.3%. This is down from 3% last year and down 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year.  As our margin increase demonstrates, strong buyer demand has allowed the company to pass through the higher labor and material costs we've experienced. That said and as Ryan discussed, we are knowingly incurring additional expenses to get houses built within today's challenged operating environment. In addition to the incremental build costs we are absorbing over the short term to get homes completed, our reported gross margins are being influenced by the mix of homes closed. As we also highlighted in our recent market update, certain of the homes that we expected to close in Q3 slipped into Q4 and others have been pushed out of the fourth quarter into 2022. These conditions are impacting our reported gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 but set us up to realize gross margin expansion as we head into 2022.  That said, with the changing mix of homes we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter, coupled with the added material, labor and logistics costs we're paying to get homes closed, we currently expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be 26.6% or 26.7%. This would represent an increase of 160 to 170 basis points over last year's fourth quarter and an increase of 10 to 20 basis points over the third quarter of this year. We see the opportunity to build on this momentum as the strong pricing conditions we've experienced, coupled with the lower lumber costs we expect in next year's closings, should result in further gross margin expansion in 2022.  Our SG&A expense for the third quarter was $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A expense for the period was $271 million for a comparable 9.6% home sale revenues. Given there's still increase in closings, we expect [Technical Difficulty] in the upcoming quarter expected to fall to a range of 8.9% to 9.2% of home sale revenues.  Looking at our financial services operations. Our third quarter pretax income was $49 million versus $64 million last year. As has been the case for much of this year, higher origination volumes have been offset by lower profitability per loan given more competitive market conditions. The company's reported tax expense in the third quarter was $145 million, for an effective tax rate of 23.3%. In the comparable prior year period, our effective rate was 14% as we realized a tax benefit of $53 million associated with energy tax credits recognized in the period. For the third quarter, our reported net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share. This compares with prior year adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the energy tax credits, of $363 million or $1.34 per share.  Moving over to the balance sheet. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow, which allowed us to end the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash after significant investment in the business and continued shareholder distributions in the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares or about 2% of our outstanding common shares for $261 million at an average price of $51.07 per share. The $261 million in stock repurchase is a sequential increase of $61 million from the second quarter of this year. As stated previously, we are fully prepared to allocate more capital to shareholders as conditions warrant.  We also invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the third quarter. This brings our total land-related spend in 2021 to $2.9 billion and keeps us on track to invest approximately $4 billion of land acquisition and development for the year, which would be an increase of almost 40% over last year. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 22.4%, which is down from 29.5% at the end of last year. Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 5.7%. We ended the third quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options. Our divisions and particularly our land teams have done an outstanding job building a more efficient land bank while helping to reduce market risk. We're extremely proud of their efforts and the success that they've realized.  Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Book ending the front of this call where I talked about supply, let me finish the call by providing a few comments about third quarter demand, which is a very positive picture. We continue to experience strong demand in the quarter with very consistent traffic and sign-up numbers across the period. I would also add that strong demand has continued through the first few weeks of October. While sign-ups in the quarter were lower compared with last year, the primary driver of the decline was the decrease in community count. Beyond the impact community count had on order rates in the quarter, our divisions continue to manage or outright restrict sales pace to better match sales with our current production.  As Bob indicated, this most recent quarter should be the low point of our community count -- should be the low point of our community count this year as we expect our community count to move higher on a sequential basis as we move through 2022. Reflecting the strong demand conditions and relatively limited supply of new and existing homes, we were able to raise prices in the quarter across most of our communities. The most typical increase in the quarter was in the range of 1% to 3%, although some of our divisions were able to push pricing in select communities a little more aggressively. That being said, we continue to keep a close eye on affordability metrics within our local markets, especially given the recent rise in mortgage rates. Between an improving economy, a strong jobs market, wage inflation and government stimulus checks, consumers are in a very strong financial position and have proven they are prepared to pay today's higher prices for everything, from food to autos to homes.  We continue to see a very strong financial profile among our homebuyers with the average FICO score remaining above 7 50 and loan-to-value of 83% based on users of our mortgage company.  Looking at demand across the country. I would tell you that generally where we have product available, we can sell it and at a higher price than earlier in the year. Although frustrated at times because of limited supply, higher prices and longer build cycles, consumers remain engaged in the home buying process and are anxious to get into a new home.  Just to wrap up, while there are certainly challenges in the business, PulteGroup remains in an excellent position, both operationally and financially. We have a strong and improving land pipeline that we continue to make more efficient through the use of lot options. We have an opportunity to further expand margins based on limited supply, strong buyer demand, resulting favorable pricing dynamics and lower lumber costs in 2022. We have an outstanding homebuilding operation that is generating tremendous cash flow, and we have an exceptional balance sheet strength and liquidity that can support our operations and gives us tremendous flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities.  Let me close by again thanking our employees for their tireless efforts to serve our homebuyers and deliver outstanding business performance. Now let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Julie will now open the queue for questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: First, I wanted to touch on gross margin. Is there any way you could just quantify the elevated costs you've incurred that will impact the fourth quarter? And then in the prepared remarks, you mentioned '22 gross margin likely moving higher, which I think there's been a lot of investor uncertainty on that. So with prices moving up, lumber coming down, other costs accelerated -- accelerating, can you just help us think through the gross margin in backlog or kind of the incoming orders?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I'll start with the fourth quarter, Truman. We obviously have taken down our margin expectation for Q4 depending on which where you pegged the margin, call it, 60 or 70 basis points from what we had originally guided. And I would suggest the way to think about that is we've got mix changes very consistent with what we had in the third quarter as stuff has moved out of the fourth quarter into '22. That's probably 30 basis points of it. And then incremental costs -- and you heard us talk about it in the prepared remarks, to get things done today is about $2,000 a house for us, which is about 40 basis points. And so that's sort of the magnitude of what we're seeing in the fourth quarter.  We didn't provide a guide for '22 gross margins, but we obviously did highlight the significant pricing that we're seeing in our backlog. It's up $78,000 a unit or 18%. Plus, we'll have lower lumber cost. Now lumber is variable. It's moved down. It moved up a little bit. We'll see where that lands. But we'll see, on a sequential basis, as we get into '22, some decreases. So certainly, the structure is there for lower margins. We'll give an estimate of what that is as we release our fourth quarter...\nTruman Patterson: Higher margins.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Did I say lower? My apologies. Higher margins in '22..\nTruman Patterson: Okay. That can...\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Jim, had a hard look on his face. I apologize for that. And we'll give you some visibility to that as we release our fourth quarter earnings, and we'll have obviously better visibility into the year at that point.\nTruman Patterson: Okay, okay. And then on the supply chain constraints, I realize it's kind of a moving target and it varies by the metro. But I'm just hoping you could run through where the most common pressure points are in the supply chain. And on the material side, any highlights on the vendors? Are they giving you a time line as to when they expect their internal capacity begins improving and actually increasing product in '22?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Truman, it's Ryan. It really depends on the region, Truman. So in like the Florida regions, there are challenges with block. Most of our homes that are built out of concrete block as opposed to lumber. So we've been on allocation there for a number of months. Windows, I would tell you, generally, across the entire United States, are a pressure point. Paint is a pressure point. and appliances would be some things that I think are common across the entire enterprise. And then when you get into certain regions, things like siding become a pain point, depending on how much of that we use in the construction of our homes in those regions.  In terms of kind of when things are solved, Truman, as I tried to highlight in my prepared remarks, we think that the time line of fixing things will be varied. And it really depends on what the underlying issue is for that particular distributor or manufacturer. There are some things that are obviously relying on microchips like appliances. And I think that those challenges are well detailed. In some cases, it's chemicals and things like resin. I think the paint suppliers, paint manufacturers have kind of highlighted some of the things they've done. In particular, Sherwin Williams recently purchased their own resin plants in order to help solidify some of the challenges that they've had in obtaining resin.  And then in some cases, it's logistics. And so there's just simply not enough transportation capacity to move things from the ports to the distribution centers or from the factories to our job sites. And so I think we're going to end up with is a mixed bag of results and recovery time lines as we move through 2022. The relationships that we have with our suppliers are outstanding. We're communicating actively with them and collaboratively solving problems. I think we're being treated very well with our suppliers, and they're bending over backwards to take care of us and the significant volume that we do of new homes. So I'm going to remain optimistic, but there's no doubt there are some headwinds out there that we're fighting through each and every day. As Bob highlighted, we'll talk more about 2022 as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, which is when we customarily provide our guidance. But there are -- there's some favorable things with community count growth, opportunity for margin expansion, et cetera, that I think leave reason to continue to be optimistic.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman.\nAlan Ratner: So first question, I'd love to dig in a little bit to the pricing environment. I believe you indicated kind of the typical price increases were about 1% to 3% in the quarter. Your average order price was up way more than that, up 9%. So I'm guessing the delta there is mix. But I'm curious if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of pricing power now versus 3 months ago, 6 months ago. A few other builders kind of suggest that maybe pricing power is moderating a bit. It doesn't sound like you're seeing that in your communities, but any color you can give there would be great.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, I would just -- I'd highlight that the demand environment continues to be very strong. And in most communities, we continue to have pricing power. We're exercising that through price increases, obviously. And in some cases, we're outright restricting sales, which I think is in the same kind of family of actions that we take to manage the demand that we have.  What I would tell you, the -- we highlighted, on average, most communities were 1% to 3%. There were certainly some communities that were well in excess of that. Those kind of outlier communities, combined with the fact that you do have some mix in there as well as, I think, contributes to the incremental increase that you highlighted in your question.  In terms of kind of where things are at today pricing power-wise relative to a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, I'd suggest it's pretty comparable to where we were at in Q2, a little weaker than where we were at in Q1 in terms of kind of month-over-month or week-over-week pricing changes. We are keeping eye on affordability. We highlighted that in our prepared remarks. I think it's something that while the consumer continues to be strong financially, they don't have unlimited financial means and resources. And so we need to be mindful of that, not only as a company, but as an industry.\nAlan Ratner: Great. I appreciate that, Ryan. Second, maybe more for Bob, but the $2,000 per house incremental cost you talked about, I'm just curious when you kind of qualitatively talk about the '22 margin outlook in terms of improvement, what's the assumption on that piece? Are you assuming that that's a temporary headwind that goes away as the supply chain normalizes? Do you think that it even goes higher if builders are kind of cramming to try to get more specs on the ground? What's the assumption embedded within the outlook for margin improvement next year?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, to be clear, we haven't given a margin expectation for next year. And part of the reason for that, Alan, is because we want to give ourselves the opportunity to really evaluate that question more fully. Certainly, the supply chain is not going to cure itself in the next 3 months, probably not the next 6. Anybody's guess as to how long beyond that. And so there will be continued constraints.  You also have kind of working in the other direction that most builders are kind of pushing towards their year-end in Q3 and Q4, so there's more kind of demand for service and materials. And that will mitigate to a degree in the first half of next year. So I think a lot of it will depend on how the supply chain kind of moves forward from here. And again, it's one of the reasons that we are waiting until the fourth quarter, not just convention, but also we think we'll get better information as we get into December, January, I can answer that question more fully.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.\nMichael Rehaut: First, I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation. Obviously, not just in terms of share repurchase, but maybe just to shift the question a little bit on lot optioning and lot owning. A lot of progress on lot optioning. But actually, if you look at the year's owned, it's sitting around 3.8, 3.9 in terms of -- 3.8, 3.7 in terms of years on supply, any thoughts around trying to get that metric down over the next 2 or 3 years? And as a result, I'd presume that it would free up even more cash to perhaps return to shareholders or invest in the company in other ways.\nRyan Marshall: Mike, it's Ryan. Yes, in terms of capital allocation, I'm really proud of what we were able to do in the quarter. The health and the quality of the homebuilding operations continues to generate outstanding cash flows. And so we were able to do a lot in the quarter. We're very pleased with the total amount of land that we've been able to invest in, in the year. We sit at right at $3 billion year-to-date and are on track for $4 billion, which will be a big year for the company. We had an outstanding quarter of returning funds to shareholders, and that's something that is very consistent with -- and right in line with our capital allocation philosophy of investing in the business and returning funds to shareholders. So I think 2 kind of very solid checkmarks there.  As it relates to, Mike, your question on land pipeline, the thing that I'd highlight is that we've got 54% of our controlled pipeline under option. We've set a target of 50%. We've passed that number, and it's something that we really are pleased with, what our teams have been able to do to continue to maintain optionality with the overall land supply.  Turning to your question on 3.7 of years supply, Mike, that number would be calculated using the trailing 12 months closings. I think that's certainly an acceptable convention in terms of how you would look at what the own pipeline is. That number is less if you look forward, and I realize we haven't given visibility to what that forward number is. But I think we've very clearly highlighted our desire to grow. And you've seen the early end of that with the amount of capital that we've been investing into the business.  So the other thing that I'd also just mentioned, and we've been consistent in stating that we haven't changed our land underwriting guidelines, and we continue to approve land deals that are right in line with our target of 3 years owned land.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. That's helpful, Ryan. I appreciate it. I guess, secondly, in -- and I apologize to you for this question in advance because I know it's a little bit of beating a dead horse, but we are getting some inbound client questions around it. The understanding that you can't -- you're not giving -- you're not quantifying gross margins for next year, you did say that you expect improvement. And I believe you're talking about improvement off of 4Q levels. So I was just trying to get a sense of is that all kind of on the lumber benefit maybe exceeding other areas of cost inflation. Or are there other drivers to that initial, at least directional, guidance, so to speak?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike. It's a fair question, and I realize that there's a lot of interest in this area from investors, and we're anticipating getting to the end of the fourth quarter when we can kind of give you more of a guide. The biggest driver is price, Mike, and I think you've seen that over the course of the year. You see what's happened in our backlog. And so that ought to give you a reasonable information to use and how much is there. We've highlighted the fact that our highest lumber loads are coming in Q3 and Q4, and we start to get benefits as we move into Q1 and Q2 of next year. So there's a lot of benefit there on the lumber side. As we're experiencing today, not only in Q3 but also Q4, we've got some incremental costs that we're paying today.  And as Bob suggested to one of the prior questions, we've got to see what the next 3 to 4 months look like in terms of how much of that we'll continue to have to pay. And they're essentially bounties. We're spending money above and beyond what we've contracted for in order to get the homes across the finish line at the quality standard that we expect. So I know it's less than a fulsome answer, but we're going to leave it as we currently see room for margin expansion next year, and I'm going to probably leave it at that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: You've been building a second off-site manufacturing facility in South Carolina. Wondering if you could talk about the progress there. And then just from a big-picture perspective, when you think about the kind of extreme supply chain pressure that you're seeing, does that sort of validate the off-site manufacturing approach and increase the urgency there? Or does it present new challenges for that model where you might have to dial things back a bit?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Anthony, thanks for the question. We are in the process of fitting out that space in South Carolina. We'd expect to be delivering product out of there in mid-2022. So that's on track at this point in time. In terms of kind of broader supply chain implications, I would tell you that the primary reason that we continue to roll out and expand our off-site manufacturing capability is related to labor availability. And we really believe that the automated nature of those off-site facilities will help to -- help us weather what will be a prolonged labor headwind within the space over the next 8 to 10 years as the current labor force continues to age out. So the current supply chain challenges, I think, are more around raw materials and more around logistics and truck drivers candidly.  So while certainly having your own facilities, you're in a bit more control of your destiny, those factories need raw materials as well. And clearly, those are in short supply. So we remain very optimistic and bullish about what the off-site facilities can do for our business and remain on the path of building 6 to 8 of these facilities over the next number of years.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then is it possible to say what percentage of your communities are still restricting sales? And other than the lower community count impacting some of the early traffic in October, is there any other trend that you'd call out between buyer type or geography that you might see is driving some sort of cooling or normalization of demand?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. We are still restricting sales in more than half of our communities today. And even in the ones where we're not, we're seeing strong traffic such that when we bring lots to market we're able to sell them. I don't think -- I'm looking at Ryan and Jim. Any other trends? I've nothing of note, no.\nRyan Marshall: Well, the only other trend I'd highlight is that we've actually seen continued strength as we've moved out of Q3 and into October. I think, normally, you would see some seasonality in sales paces and trends, and we're quite pleased with the activity that we've seen so far sitting here in the third week of October.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: So on the active adult business, obviously, kind of a less severe community decline, and it sounds like less sales restrictions in those communities, perhaps given the depth of available product and lots you've got there. Is it fair to assume that the mix of active adult delivery shift should, therefore, be higher in '22? And I'm curious if you could remind us how the margin and return profile on that product might look compared to the rest of the business.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: In terms of forward mix, it varies by quarter. Candidly, in the current quarter, it was about 29% of our sign-ups. Prior year, it was about 25%. So you may see a 1% or 2% or 3% kind of mix shift. Interestingly, given the way the market has behaved, there isn't a significant difference today in the margin profile of that business versus the move-up or entry level. So I don't think it causes any significant change and it hasn't really for the last couple of years. The market is pretty strong across the board. You saw 8% price increase first-time, 10% move-up, 8% active adults. So we're seeing kind of that rising tide lift all boats.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. No, that's very helpful there, Bob. Second one, just on the topic of the sales restrictions and supply chain. Obviously, the reduction to delivery guidance for Q4. I'm curious how we should think about the kind of balance of these production bottlenecks, which is kind of unpredictable how long this will last, versus the rebuilding of spec inventory that you've now been doing for quite some time. Is it realistic that, as we get into the spring, you might see a normal or even greater-than-normal uptick in both spec sales and deliveries associated with that just as you worked so hard on kind of rebuilding inventory homes?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Matt, it's Ryan. We have worked hard to get more spec into the pipeline. I think we've been highlighting for the last 2 or 3 quarters that ideal for us is to be 25% to 30% of our total inventory -- of our total inventory stack. We're -- we've got 1,000 more specs in the pipeline today than we did a year ago. So we're very happy about that. It's still only 17% of our total production. So we're a full 10% to kind of 13% below where we'd optimally like to be. So it's better.  We highlighted the fact that where we've restricted sales more is in our first-time communities. That also happens to be where we're rebuilding that spec pipeline. So look, if we can continue to have some success there, we can move those units along, we can get them closer to being ready for delivery. That's when you put those on the market for that buyer group. And certainly, our hope would be that we've got more available to sell as we move through Q4 and into Q1 next year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: Wanted to follow up first with a question around pricing power because it does seem like your comments and your results suggest a little more positive tone around pricing than I think some peers has alluded to earlier, have talked about more recently. And that's consistent in the work that we've tracked as well. So I guess the question is, when you look at kind of the sales restrictions, when you look at your balance of price versus pace, do you think that you're acting in a way that's different than peers right now and still pushing a little more price and later on a little more in terms of restrictions than some of your peers?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, I'm not -- I'm probably not in a position to make a great comparison there with specific data other than anecdotally. The one thing I would highlight is, I think, it's the benefit of our build-to-order model. In our build-to-order model, I think we continue to give customers the ability to choose their lot, their floor plan and to personalize the home in the way that they see the most value. And so I do think that our strategic pricing model, which we probably haven't talked about as much over the last couple of quarters because things have been so frenzy, I think that does continue to give us some pricing power that's a competitive advantage relative to our peers would be probably the biggest thing that I would highlight.  Related to that model, a big component of it is the option in the lot premiums, and that's up 7% year-over-year. So we've seen some nice growth from those 2 things, which are, I think, you all appreciate big contributors to our overall margin and profitability.\nMichael Dahl: Got it. Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, it's somewhat related slight variation. But when we look at the pace, it's sitting at a little below 3 a month in terms of orders. And I think the closing is right around 3 a month. Even some peers at kind of the middle of higher end of the price spectrum right now, I think, are putting up pace and construction starts a little bit north of that. So it does seem like you're going outside the lines in terms of like paying up to get what you can across the finish line. But I guess I'm wondering, are there some things that you're seeing in the market where you're just saying that just doesn't make sense? We're going to -- we've paid up the $2,000, but this extra piece just -- we can't justify it. So we'll either keep the restrictions or we're going to push out the deliveries depending on when -- whether you're looking at orders or closing.  So I guess without talking specifically about your -- any of your competitors, are there certain areas in the market that you're just choosing not to be as aggressive to get things closed today versus what you theoretically could?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Mike, there's a lot in that question. So let me unpack a few pieces, and I'm going to start with absorptions per community. We -- what I'd start with is I'd reiterate the continued strong demand that we've seen from consumers, not only in the quarter, but what's continued into October. If -- our orders and absorptions in the quarter, while maybe lower than what we would have liked, I'd want to highlight a couple of things. Number one, except for entry level, the absorptions that we had in the quarter were consistent with what we had in the prior year. So Bob highlighted that in his prepared remarks. The change there was completely driven by the community count decline. The exception to that is entry level, where we had more -- we had lower absorptions and lower sign-ups relative to the drop that we saw on the community count.  The area that I'd probably highlight is Texas. Texas is a state where we have a lot of entry-level Centex communities, and that happens to be a place where we've significantly restricted lot sales as we rebuild that spec pipeline. So all in all, we feel really good about the way that homes are selling and the underlying demand that continues to be there.  In terms of cost, Mike, I would tell you, I think we're doing things where we believe we can make a difference. So if we can get the material, if we can put it on a truck, if we can send somebody to the other side of the state to pick it up and get it, we're going to do it. And I don't -- I think the added costs are to simply compensate people for the extra time and effort that's going into getting it done. So I don't feel that we're doing anything unreasonable or being held hostage to do anything.  We're also really thinking about our customer. That's something that we put first and foremost in everything we do. We're really proud of the quality of the homes that we build. And so we're not going to deliver incomplete homes or rush things across the finish line that we don't believe meet our quality standards. And we're kind of unwavering on that.  So in terms of kind of how much we're paying relative to what our competitors are paying, I think my sense is we're very competitive there. I don't think we're doing anything that would be out of line relative to the competition. So we feel pretty good about what we've been able to do given the operating conditions that not only this industry is in, the whole world is in.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore.\nStephen Kim: I wanted to drill in on the 4Q gross margin guide. You talked about, I think, 70 basis points -- guiding about 70 basis points lower than what you had done previously. And you had indicated, I think, that 40 basis points of that was sort of these extra costs, maybe 30 basis points was mix. So within the extra cost, I wanted to clarify that this is actually what I guess you could call scrambling costs, like just scrambling around to try to get these homes closed and whatnot, generalized -- general input cost inflation. Because of that, you would expect to sort of persist. But sort of the scrambling around kind of cost you would expect to dissipate. So I just wanted to clarify that 40 basis points of extra costs is, in fact, not just generalized input cost inflation.  And if you could provide maybe some additional color around what kind of -- these unusual costs you're doing, like are you warehousing products just to make sure that you have them on hand when you need them? If you could give some color around that, that would be helpful.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, you summarized it correctly. It's -- I wouldn't have thought of scrambling costs, but it's not a bad descriptor. We, in our more recent commentary, told folks that we saw kind of 9% to 11% inflationary costs. And we're still there, and this is just the things we're doing above and beyond that to get stuff done. And you heard Ryan talk about some of those in his prepared remarks. Literally, paint suppliers don't have paint, so we're asking people to drive to go buy paint in retail stores. That's not normal. It's not the way we do business. We are shipping trusses from market A to market B. Again -- because there was a truss factory buyer in market B that limited the production capability there.  And there are myriad examples of that. And they're different for different types of construction. They are different, different markets for us. You kind of mash it all together, and that's the $2,000 a unit. So on some units, it might not be much at all. On others, it might be $8,000, depending on the circumstance. That kind of blend to that $2,000. I might steal scrambling costs, so thank you for that.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Stephen, and I would highlight, you mentioned it, we're warehousing things like windows. If we can get them, we are ordering them earlier than we need them. You're putting them in a storage unit or a warehouse, and we're hauling those windows when we need it. So that's part of those incremental costs as well.\nStephen Kim: Great. And then just to make sure that I'm crystal clear on it, this $2,000, is that the total amount of these sort of unusual costs? Or is that simply the increment from what you had previously thought you might have to absorb these kind of special costs 3 months ago?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: These are incremental costs as we've kind of -- we're 3 months smarter, Stephen, because of what we're seeing in the field real-time.\nStephen Kim: Right. So that's just the change from 3 months ago. That's not necessarily the total?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Correct, correct.\nStephen Kim: I imagine 3 months ago you anticipated something -- okay. Got it. Just to make sure. And then the 30 basis points that relates -- I think you indicated mix. And I just wanted to make sure I understood what that mix was because you've indicated that margins are pretty similar across the 3 product types. Maybe there's some regional differences. But I just wanted to understand what that mix was. And then also one thing you didn't really specifically mention in the 30 and the 40 basis points was lumber. Is lumber going to hit 4Q worse than you had expected 3 months ago? And is it going to be a heavier sort of drag on your margins than it was in 3Q?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Stephen, the mix commentary is not on product, it's on geography. And we had highlighted that in the market update in our conversations then. Essentially, what has happened is the margins on some of the units that got pushed from Q3 into Q4 were higher-margin units. And similarly, the ones that got pushed from Q4 into next year are higher-margin units. Part of that is just where they are in the production cycle, part of it is geography in terms of where they are. We always highlight that mix matters. We will get that margin. It's just a little bit later than we thought.  And in terms of lumber, no, we have pretty good visibility into our lumber pricing. We know what the lumber packs are going to be on our -- we knew what they were on Q3. We know what they are in Q4. We have pretty good visibility into what they're going to be next year. And so that wasn't -- the lumber component hasn't changed in what we thought and what we're guiding.\nRyan Marshall: But there is more in Q4 than there was in Q3, which I think we've also highlighted for a number of quarters, Stephen, that the highest load was coming in Q4. And that's incorporated and has been incorporated into the guide that we've given.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.\nEric Bosshard: Two things. First of all, the change in 4Q on gross margin, that's helpful to clarify. I think the delivery number is different in 4Q and relative to what you said 45 days ago. Can you just explain what changed in regards to that relative to 45 days ago?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Eric, thanks for the question. It is different than what we highlighted 45 days ago. And I think it's just the continued disruption that is going on in the supply chain world. So every day, as we move things down the production line, we're making an assessment as to whether or not it will deliver in the quarter. There were homes that were in production where we were anticipating getting certain supplies that we needed in order to meet a Q4 delivery. And once you cross kind of certain kind -- kind of critical path dates, you start to run out of days where you can compress schedules. And so candidly, things slide. Our run rate at this point in time is 100 to 150 homes a day. So you lose 2, 3, 4 days of time due to delays, and the numbers -- the numbers have been adjusted as we've indicated today.\nEric Bosshard: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, the conviction in community count growth, 3Q being the bottom, the improvement from here, just a little bit of color for why you have the conviction in the progress and the magnitude of the progress.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So we've got great visibility into the land that we own and the -- specifically which communities that, that land is allocated to. We've got good visibility into how those communities are moving through the entitlement and the development process. Certainly, those are subject to or run the risk of delays just like the vertical side. But given what we see in our pipeline and adjusting for what we think will be headwinds next year, we are very confident that we'll see community count growth and expansion into next year. So we'll give you the specific numbers at the end of Q4, Eric, but we're confident enough that we've hit the low point that we can give you at least a preview that we'll see expansion in Q4 and nice expansion into next year as well.\nOperator: Thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Julie. I appreciate everybody's time this morning. Certainly be available over the course of the day to answer any follow-up questions, and we look forward to speaking with you on the next call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Robert O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. Our teams have done an outstanding job navigating through the challenging production environment, which can be seen in the exceptional operating and financial results we delivered in the quarter.  Starting with our income statement. Our home sale revenues for the third quarter increased 18% over last year to $3.3 billion. The increase in revenues was driven by a 9% increase in closings to 7,007 homes in combination with an 8% or $37,000 increase in average sales price to $474,000. The higher average sales price realized in the third quarter reflects meaningful price increases we've realized across all buyer groups, with first-time up 8%, move-up up 10% and active adult up 8%. The mix of homes we delivered in the third quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 44% from move-up buyers and 24% from active adult buyers. In last year's third quarter, 30% of homes delivered were first-time, 45% were move-up and 25% were active adult.  Our net new orders for the third quarter were 6,796 homes, which represents a 17% decrease from last year that was driven primarily by a 14% decline in year-over-year community count. In addition to fewer open communities, orders for the period were impacted by ongoing actions to manage sales paces to better align with current production volumes. The actions to manage sales pace and outright restrict sales were more frequently targeted toward our first-time buyer communities as we strategically work to build up spec inventory within our Centex branded communities.  Looking at our third quarter orders in a little more detail. Our orders from first-time buyers decreased 20% compared with last year. This decrease was driven primarily by our actions to restrict sales as our first-time community count was only down 6% compared with last year. In contrast, our orders from move-up and active adult buyers decreased 22% and 4%, respectively, which was driven by comparable 22% and 5% decreases in community count, respectively.  In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 768 communities. Consistent with the guide in our recent market update, this is down 14% from last year's average of 892 communities. Our Q3 community count should be the low watermark for the year as we expect our fourth quarter community count to increase to approximately 775 active communities.  Further, our existing land pipeline should allow us to realize a meaningful ramp-up in community count as we move through 2022. As is our practice, we will provide more specifics on 2022 community count as part of our fourth quarter earnings call.  Our unit backlog at the end of the third quarter was up 33% over last year to 19,845 homes. The dollar value of our backlog increased an even greater 56% to $10.3 billion as we benefited from robust price increases realized over the course of this year. At the end of the third quarter, we had 18,802 homes under construction, of which 83% were sold and 17% re-spec. We have almost 900 more spec homes in production than we did in the second quarter as we have been working to increase spec availability, particularly in our Centex communities. In many instances, this has meant tightly controlling current period order rates, but we feel this is the appropriate action as we seek to better align our sales with the current pace of production.  Given that 90% of our specs are early in the construction cycle and we have only 109 finished specs, these units are about helping to position the company for 2022, rather than providing closings in 2021. We faced similar dynamics within our production of sold units as 2/3 of these homes are in the earlier stages of construction, and we can see gaps in the supply of key building products needed to complete these homes. Given these conditions, we believe it appropriate to update our fourth quarter guide for expected fourth quarter deliveries and currently expect to deliver approximately 8,500 homes in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 24% over the fourth quarter of last year.  It's difficult to say there are positives to be gleaned from the challenging production environment, but one of the outcomes is that the limited supply of homes, coupled with ongoing strong demand, has supported higher prices across the market. Reflective of these conditions, our average price in backlog increased 18% or $78,000 over last year to $519,000. Although more than half of our quarter end backlog is expected to deliver in 2022, we will continue to see the benefit of rising prices in our fourth quarter as our average closing price is expected to be $485,000 to $490,000. At the midpoint, this would represent an increase of approximately 10% over last year.  Our reported homebuilding gross margin in the third quarter increased 200 basis points over last year to 26.5%. Given that our third quarter closings absorbed the elevated lumber prices from earlier this year, expanding our gross margin by 200 basis points attest to the strong pricing environment the industry experienced over the past year. It's worth noting that the strong market conditions also contributed to another step down in incentives in the period as discounts fell to 1.3%. This is down from 3% last year and down 60 basis points from the second quarter of this year.  As our margin increase demonstrates, strong buyer demand has allowed the company to pass through the higher labor and material costs we've experienced. That said and as Ryan discussed, we are knowingly incurring additional expenses to get houses built within today's challenged operating environment. In addition to the incremental build costs we are absorbing over the short term to get homes completed, our reported gross margins are being influenced by the mix of homes closed. As we also highlighted in our recent market update, certain of the homes that we expected to close in Q3 slipped into Q4 and others have been pushed out of the fourth quarter into 2022. These conditions are impacting our reported gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 but set us up to realize gross margin expansion as we head into 2022.  That said, with the changing mix of homes we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter, coupled with the added material, labor and logistics costs we're paying to get homes closed, we currently expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be 26.6% or 26.7%. This would represent an increase of 160 to 170 basis points over last year's fourth quarter and an increase of 10 to 20 basis points over the third quarter of this year. We see the opportunity to build on this momentum as the strong pricing conditions we've experienced, coupled with the lower lumber costs we expect in next year's closings, should result in further gross margin expansion in 2022.  Our SG&A expense for the third quarter was $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. Prior year SG&A expense for the period was $271 million for a comparable 9.6% home sale revenues. Given there's still increase in closings, we expect [Technical Difficulty] in the upcoming quarter expected to fall to a range of 8.9% to 9.2% of home sale revenues.  Looking at our financial services operations. Our third quarter pretax income was $49 million versus $64 million last year. As has been the case for much of this year, higher origination volumes have been offset by lower profitability per loan given more competitive market conditions. The company's reported tax expense in the third quarter was $145 million, for an effective tax rate of 23.3%. In the comparable prior year period, our effective rate was 14% as we realized a tax benefit of $53 million associated with energy tax credits recognized in the period. For the third quarter, our reported net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share. This compares with prior year adjusted net income, excluding the impact of the energy tax credits, of $363 million or $1.34 per share.  Moving over to the balance sheet. Our business continues to generate strong cash flow, which allowed us to end the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash after significant investment in the business and continued shareholder distributions in the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares or about 2% of our outstanding common shares for $261 million at an average price of $51.07 per share. The $261 million in stock repurchase is a sequential increase of $61 million from the second quarter of this year. As stated previously, we are fully prepared to allocate more capital to shareholders as conditions warrant.  We also invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the third quarter. This brings our total land-related spend in 2021 to $2.9 billion and keeps us on track to invest approximately $4 billion of land acquisition and development for the year, which would be an increase of almost 40% over last year. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 22.4%, which is down from 29.5% at the end of last year. Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 5.7%. We ended the third quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options. Our divisions and particularly our land teams have done an outstanding job building a more efficient land bank while helping to reduce market risk. We're extremely proud of their efforts and the success that they've realized.  Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yes. I'll start with the fourth quarter, Truman. We obviously have taken down our margin expectation for Q4 depending on which where you pegged the margin, call it, 60 or 70 basis points from what we had originally guided. And I would suggest the way to think about that is we've got mix changes very consistent with what we had in the third quarter as stuff has moved out of the fourth quarter into '22. That's probably 30 basis points of it. And then incremental costs -- and you heard us talk about it in the prepared remarks, to get things done today is about $2,000 a house for us, which is about 40 basis points. And so that's sort of the magnitude of what we're seeing in the fourth quarter.  We didn't provide a guide for '22 gross margins, but we obviously did highlight the significant pricing that we're seeing in our backlog. It's up $78,000 a unit or 18%. Plus, we'll have lower lumber cost. Now lumber is variable. It's moved down. It moved up a little bit. We'll see where that lands. But we'll see, on a sequential basis, as we get into '22, some decreases. So certainly, the structure is there for lower margins. We'll give an estimate of what that is as we release our fourth quarter... Did I say lower? My apologies. Higher margins in '22.. Jim, had a hard look on his face. I apologize for that. And we'll give you some visibility to that as we release our fourth quarter earnings, and we'll have obviously better visibility into the year at that point. Well, to be clear, we haven't given a margin expectation for next year. And part of the reason for that, Alan, is because we want to give ourselves the opportunity to really evaluate that question more fully. Certainly, the supply chain is not going to cure itself in the next 3 months, probably not the next 6. Anybody's guess as to how long beyond that. And so there will be continued constraints.  You also have kind of working in the other direction that most builders are kind of pushing towards their year-end in Q3 and Q4, so there's more kind of demand for service and materials. And that will mitigate to a degree in the first half of next year. So I think a lot of it will depend on how the supply chain kind of moves forward from here. And again, it's one of the reasons that we are waiting until the fourth quarter, not just convention, but also we think we'll get better information as we get into December, January, I can answer that question more fully. Yes. We are still restricting sales in more than half of our communities today. And even in the ones where we're not, we're seeing strong traffic such that when we bring lots to market we're able to sell them. I don't think -- I'm looking at Ryan and Jim. Any other trends? I've nothing of note, no. In terms of forward mix, it varies by quarter. Candidly, in the current quarter, it was about 29% of our sign-ups. Prior year, it was about 25%. So you may see a 1% or 2% or 3% kind of mix shift. Interestingly, given the way the market has behaved, there isn't a significant difference today in the margin profile of that business versus the move-up or entry level. So I don't think it causes any significant change and it hasn't really for the last couple of years. The market is pretty strong across the board. You saw 8% price increase first-time, 10% move-up, 8% active adults. So we're seeing kind of that rising tide lift all boats. Yes, Stephen, you summarized it correctly. It's -- I wouldn't have thought of scrambling costs, but it's not a bad descriptor. We, in our more recent commentary, told folks that we saw kind of 9% to 11% inflationary costs. And we're still there, and this is just the things we're doing above and beyond that to get stuff done. And you heard Ryan talk about some of those in his prepared remarks. Literally, paint suppliers don't have paint, so we're asking people to drive to go buy paint in retail stores. That's not normal. It's not the way we do business. We are shipping trusses from market A to market B. Again -- because there was a truss factory buyer in market B that limited the production capability there.  And there are myriad examples of that. And they're different for different types of construction. They are different, different markets for us. You kind of mash it all together, and that's the $2,000 a unit. So on some units, it might not be much at all. On others, it might be $8,000, depending on the circumstance. That kind of blend to that $2,000. I might steal scrambling costs, so thank you for that. These are incremental costs as we've kind of -- we're 3 months smarter, Stephen, because of what we're seeing in the field real-time. Correct, correct. Yes, Stephen, the mix commentary is not on product, it's on geography. And we had highlighted that in the market update in our conversations then. Essentially, what has happened is the margins on some of the units that got pushed from Q3 into Q4 were higher-margin units. And similarly, the ones that got pushed from Q4 into next year are higher-margin units. Part of that is just where they are in the production cycle, part of it is geography in terms of where they are. We always highlight that mix matters. We will get that margin. It's just a little bit later than we thought.  And in terms of lumber, no, we have pretty good visibility into our lumber pricing. We know what the lumber packs are going to be on our -- we knew what they were on Q3. We know what they are in Q4. We have pretty good visibility into what they're going to be next year. And so that wasn't -- the lumber component hasn't changed in what we thought and what we're guiding."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I look forward to speaking with you today about PulteGroup's third quarter operating and financial results. In this morning's press release, you read that our home sale revenues in the third quarter increased by 18% over last year to $3.3 billion, while our gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 26.5%. In combination, top line growth and margin expansion helped drive higher earnings per share of $1.82. This is an increase of 36% over the prior year's third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.34 per share. Inclusive of these strong third quarter numbers through the first 9 months of 2021, our home sale revenues were up 22% to $9.2 billion while our reported earnings per share are up 36% to $4.85. The resulting strong cash flow being generated by our operations continues to put our company in an enviable position in which we can invest in our business, return funds to shareholders and still maintain outstanding balance sheet strength and overall liquidity.  More specifically, consistent with our constructive view on the housing market, we have invested $2.9 billion in land acquisition and development so far this year. Our $2.9 billion of land spend is comparable to what we invested for the full year in both 2020 and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, and we remain fully on track to invest approximately $4 billion in total for the full year of 2021.  I would highlight that while we are investing more into the business, we remain disciplined and focused on building a more efficient and lower-risk land pipeline. At the end of the third quarter, our lots under option had grown to 54% of our total controlled lot position compared to when I set the initial 50% option target, we have over 65,000 more lots under option and now view 50% as the floor rather than the ceiling in terms of how we control our land assets.  Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, along with investing $948 million more in land acquisition and development through the first 9 months of 2021 compared with last year, we have also returned $726 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have paid off nearly $800 million in debt this year, leaving us with a net debt-to-capital ratio of only 5.7%. Finally, consistent with our strategic focus, our operating and financial performance has helped drive a return on equity of 26% for the trailing 12 months.  Just like the broader economy, our operations continue to be impacted by the pandemic. On one hand, we are managing through the disruptions COVID-19 and the Delta variant have inflicted on our workforce, our trade partners and the global supply chain. On the other hand, our results have certainly benefited from the remarkable demand and pricing environment the homebuilding industry has experienced over the past 18 months. Either way, to deliver our third quarter numbers during the global pandemic and with a supply chain that is clearly struggling reflects the commitment and tireless efforts of the entire PulteGroup team.  Since we updated our production guidance in early September, broader industry comments have validated the challenges within the construction supply chain are significant and don't have any quick fixes. Based on a myriad of calls and questions we have received, I think it's hard for everyone to appreciate the full magnitude of the issues we're facing when you're not dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. For some products, it's simply the materials aren't available. Sometimes you can switch to an alternative. But when you can, you wait. For others, it's changing lead times where order fulfillment has gone from 6 weeks to 16 weeks, back to 11 weeks and then back to 16 weeks. And for others, it's seeing allocations being imposed as manufacturers and distributors do their best to keep their major customers, which I would note we are one, at least partially satisfied. Our local divisions may not get much advanced notice of the shortage resulting allocations so we have to adjust on the fly.  In other cases, it's logistics. When you're forced to ship materials to solve near-term issues, this might be shipping siding from the Southeast to the Southwest or our trades driving across the state for paint. In one form or another, these issues impacted our third quarter results and, as Bob will detail, will put additional pressure on our deliveries and margins in the fourth quarter. As difficult and frustrating as this is, I can say that our suppliers have been outstanding partners and routinely bend over backwards to get us the materials we need to solve our issues.  I can say that we've been clear with our teams that we have to be -- that we have to overcommunicate with customers to keep them informed of any schedule changes. We also have to be flexible and creative in sourcing materials even if this means spending additional dollars to acquire needed resources. And finally, we must maintain our standards on the quality and completeness of each home that we deliver. Given the very problems impacting the supply chain, we would expect a solution that -- we would expect that solutions will be found over different time lines, depending on the suppliers' underlying issue. In the interim, we will adjust our production estimates for the fourth quarter and work to position the business for more consistent cadence in the year ahead. We will also continue to work in close partnership with our suppliers to manage through the supply chain issues as quickly and as intelligently as possible.  Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our third quarter results. Book ending the front of this call where I talked about supply, let me finish the call by providing a few comments about third quarter demand, which is a very positive picture. We continue to experience strong demand in the quarter with very consistent traffic and sign-up numbers across the period. I would also add that strong demand has continued through the first few weeks of October. While sign-ups in the quarter were lower compared with last year, the primary driver of the decline was the decrease in community count. Beyond the impact community count had on order rates in the quarter, our divisions continue to manage or outright restrict sales pace to better match sales with our current production.  As Bob indicated, this most recent quarter should be the low point of our community count -- should be the low point of our community count this year as we expect our community count to move higher on a sequential basis as we move through 2022. Reflecting the strong demand conditions and relatively limited supply of new and existing homes, we were able to raise prices in the quarter across most of our communities. The most typical increase in the quarter was in the range of 1% to 3%, although some of our divisions were able to push pricing in select communities a little more aggressively. That being said, we continue to keep a close eye on affordability metrics within our local markets, especially given the recent rise in mortgage rates. Between an improving economy, a strong jobs market, wage inflation and government stimulus checks, consumers are in a very strong financial position and have proven they are prepared to pay today's higher prices for everything, from food to autos to homes.  We continue to see a very strong financial profile among our homebuyers with the average FICO score remaining above 7 50 and loan-to-value of 83% based on users of our mortgage company.  Looking at demand across the country. I would tell you that generally where we have product available, we can sell it and at a higher price than earlier in the year. Although frustrated at times because of limited supply, higher prices and longer build cycles, consumers remain engaged in the home buying process and are anxious to get into a new home.  Just to wrap up, while there are certainly challenges in the business, PulteGroup remains in an excellent position, both operationally and financially. We have a strong and improving land pipeline that we continue to make more efficient through the use of lot options. We have an opportunity to further expand margins based on limited supply, strong buyer demand, resulting favorable pricing dynamics and lower lumber costs in 2022. We have an outstanding homebuilding operation that is generating tremendous cash flow, and we have an exceptional balance sheet strength and liquidity that can support our operations and gives us tremendous flexibility to capitalize on market opportunities.  Let me close by again thanking our employees for their tireless efforts to serve our homebuyers and deliver outstanding business performance. Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Yes, Truman, it's Ryan. It really depends on the region, Truman. So in like the Florida regions, there are challenges with block. Most of our homes that are built out of concrete block as opposed to lumber. So we've been on allocation there for a number of months. Windows, I would tell you, generally, across the entire United States, are a pressure point. Paint is a pressure point. and appliances would be some things that I think are common across the entire enterprise. And then when you get into certain regions, things like siding become a pain point, depending on how much of that we use in the construction of our homes in those regions.  In terms of kind of when things are solved, Truman, as I tried to highlight in my prepared remarks, we think that the time line of fixing things will be varied. And it really depends on what the underlying issue is for that particular distributor or manufacturer. There are some things that are obviously relying on microchips like appliances. And I think that those challenges are well detailed. In some cases, it's chemicals and things like resin. I think the paint suppliers, paint manufacturers have kind of highlighted some of the things they've done. In particular, Sherwin Williams recently purchased their own resin plants in order to help solidify some of the challenges that they've had in obtaining resin.  And then in some cases, it's logistics. And so there's just simply not enough transportation capacity to move things from the ports to the distribution centers or from the factories to our job sites. And so I think we're going to end up with is a mixed bag of results and recovery time lines as we move through 2022. The relationships that we have with our suppliers are outstanding. We're communicating actively with them and collaboratively solving problems. I think we're being treated very well with our suppliers, and they're bending over backwards to take care of us and the significant volume that we do of new homes. So I'm going to remain optimistic, but there's no doubt there are some headwinds out there that we're fighting through each and every day. As Bob highlighted, we'll talk more about 2022 as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, which is when we customarily provide our guidance. But there are -- there's some favorable things with community count growth, opportunity for margin expansion, et cetera, that I think leave reason to continue to be optimistic. Yes, Alan, I would just -- I'd highlight that the demand environment continues to be very strong. And in most communities, we continue to have pricing power. We're exercising that through price increases, obviously. And in some cases, we're outright restricting sales, which I think is in the same kind of family of actions that we take to manage the demand that we have.  What I would tell you, the -- we highlighted, on average, most communities were 1% to 3%. There were certainly some communities that were well in excess of that. Those kind of outlier communities, combined with the fact that you do have some mix in there as well as, I think, contributes to the incremental increase that you highlighted in your question.  In terms of kind of where things are at today pricing power-wise relative to a quarter ago, 2 quarters ago, I'd suggest it's pretty comparable to where we were at in Q2, a little weaker than where we were at in Q1 in terms of kind of month-over-month or week-over-week pricing changes. We are keeping eye on affordability. We highlighted that in our prepared remarks. I think it's something that while the consumer continues to be strong financially, they don't have unlimited financial means and resources. And so we need to be mindful of that, not only as a company, but as an industry. Mike, it's Ryan. Yes, in terms of capital allocation, I'm really proud of what we were able to do in the quarter. The health and the quality of the homebuilding operations continues to generate outstanding cash flows. And so we were able to do a lot in the quarter. We're very pleased with the total amount of land that we've been able to invest in, in the year. We sit at right at $3 billion year-to-date and are on track for $4 billion, which will be a big year for the company. We had an outstanding quarter of returning funds to shareholders, and that's something that is very consistent with -- and right in line with our capital allocation philosophy of investing in the business and returning funds to shareholders. So I think 2 kind of very solid checkmarks there.  As it relates to, Mike, your question on land pipeline, the thing that I'd highlight is that we've got 54% of our controlled pipeline under option. We've set a target of 50%. We've passed that number, and it's something that we really are pleased with, what our teams have been able to do to continue to maintain optionality with the overall land supply.  Turning to your question on 3.7 of years supply, Mike, that number would be calculated using the trailing 12 months closings. I think that's certainly an acceptable convention in terms of how you would look at what the own pipeline is. That number is less if you look forward, and I realize we haven't given visibility to what that forward number is. But I think we've very clearly highlighted our desire to grow. And you've seen the early end of that with the amount of capital that we've been investing into the business.  So the other thing that I'd also just mentioned, and we've been consistent in stating that we haven't changed our land underwriting guidelines, and we continue to approve land deals that are right in line with our target of 3 years owned land. Yes, Mike. It's a fair question, and I realize that there's a lot of interest in this area from investors, and we're anticipating getting to the end of the fourth quarter when we can kind of give you more of a guide. The biggest driver is price, Mike, and I think you've seen that over the course of the year. You see what's happened in our backlog. And so that ought to give you a reasonable information to use and how much is there. We've highlighted the fact that our highest lumber loads are coming in Q3 and Q4, and we start to get benefits as we move into Q1 and Q2 of next year. So there's a lot of benefit there on the lumber side. As we're experiencing today, not only in Q3 but also Q4, we've got some incremental costs that we're paying today.  And as Bob suggested to one of the prior questions, we've got to see what the next 3 to 4 months look like in terms of how much of that we'll continue to have to pay. And they're essentially bounties. We're spending money above and beyond what we've contracted for in order to get the homes across the finish line at the quality standard that we expect. So I know it's less than a fulsome answer, but we're going to leave it as we currently see room for margin expansion next year, and I'm going to probably leave it at that. Yes, Anthony, thanks for the question. We are in the process of fitting out that space in South Carolina. We'd expect to be delivering product out of there in mid-2022. So that's on track at this point in time. In terms of kind of broader supply chain implications, I would tell you that the primary reason that we continue to roll out and expand our off-site manufacturing capability is related to labor availability. And we really believe that the automated nature of those off-site facilities will help to -- help us weather what will be a prolonged labor headwind within the space over the next 8 to 10 years as the current labor force continues to age out. So the current supply chain challenges, I think, are more around raw materials and more around logistics and truck drivers candidly.  So while certainly having your own facilities, you're in a bit more control of your destiny, those factories need raw materials as well. And clearly, those are in short supply. So we remain very optimistic and bullish about what the off-site facilities can do for our business and remain on the path of building 6 to 8 of these facilities over the next number of years. Well, the only other trend I'd highlight is that we've actually seen continued strength as we've moved out of Q3 and into October. I think, normally, you would see some seasonality in sales paces and trends, and we're quite pleased with the activity that we've seen so far sitting here in the third week of October. Yes. Matt, it's Ryan. We have worked hard to get more spec into the pipeline. I think we've been highlighting for the last 2 or 3 quarters that ideal for us is to be 25% to 30% of our total inventory -- of our total inventory stack. We're -- we've got 1,000 more specs in the pipeline today than we did a year ago. So we're very happy about that. It's still only 17% of our total production. So we're a full 10% to kind of 13% below where we'd optimally like to be. So it's better.  We highlighted the fact that where we've restricted sales more is in our first-time communities. That also happens to be where we're rebuilding that spec pipeline. So look, if we can continue to have some success there, we can move those units along, we can get them closer to being ready for delivery. That's when you put those on the market for that buyer group. And certainly, our hope would be that we've got more available to sell as we move through Q4 and into Q1 next year. Yes, Mike, I'm not -- I'm probably not in a position to make a great comparison there with specific data other than anecdotally. The one thing I would highlight is, I think, it's the benefit of our build-to-order model. In our build-to-order model, I think we continue to give customers the ability to choose their lot, their floor plan and to personalize the home in the way that they see the most value. And so I do think that our strategic pricing model, which we probably haven't talked about as much over the last couple of quarters because things have been so frenzy, I think that does continue to give us some pricing power that's a competitive advantage relative to our peers would be probably the biggest thing that I would highlight.  Related to that model, a big component of it is the option in the lot premiums, and that's up 7% year-over-year. So we've seen some nice growth from those 2 things, which are, I think, you all appreciate big contributors to our overall margin and profitability. Yes. Mike, there's a lot in that question. So let me unpack a few pieces, and I'm going to start with absorptions per community. We -- what I'd start with is I'd reiterate the continued strong demand that we've seen from consumers, not only in the quarter, but what's continued into October. If -- our orders and absorptions in the quarter, while maybe lower than what we would have liked, I'd want to highlight a couple of things. Number one, except for entry level, the absorptions that we had in the quarter were consistent with what we had in the prior year. So Bob highlighted that in his prepared remarks. The change there was completely driven by the community count decline. The exception to that is entry level, where we had more -- we had lower absorptions and lower sign-ups relative to the drop that we saw on the community count.  The area that I'd probably highlight is Texas. Texas is a state where we have a lot of entry-level Centex communities, and that happens to be a place where we've significantly restricted lot sales as we rebuild that spec pipeline. So all in all, we feel really good about the way that homes are selling and the underlying demand that continues to be there.  In terms of cost, Mike, I would tell you, I think we're doing things where we believe we can make a difference. So if we can get the material, if we can put it on a truck, if we can send somebody to the other side of the state to pick it up and get it, we're going to do it. And I don't -- I think the added costs are to simply compensate people for the extra time and effort that's going into getting it done. So I don't feel that we're doing anything unreasonable or being held hostage to do anything.  We're also really thinking about our customer. That's something that we put first and foremost in everything we do. We're really proud of the quality of the homes that we build. And so we're not going to deliver incomplete homes or rush things across the finish line that we don't believe meet our quality standards. And we're kind of unwavering on that.  So in terms of kind of how much we're paying relative to what our competitors are paying, I think my sense is we're very competitive there. I don't think we're doing anything that would be out of line relative to the competition. So we feel pretty good about what we've been able to do given the operating conditions that not only this industry is in, the whole world is in. Yes. Stephen, and I would highlight, you mentioned it, we're warehousing things like windows. If we can get them, we are ordering them earlier than we need them. You're putting them in a storage unit or a warehouse, and we're hauling those windows when we need it. So that's part of those incremental costs as well. But there is more in Q4 than there was in Q3, which I think we've also highlighted for a number of quarters, Stephen, that the highest load was coming in Q4. And that's incorporated and has been incorporated into the guide that we've given. Yes. Eric, thanks for the question. It is different than what we highlighted 45 days ago. And I think it's just the continued disruption that is going on in the supply chain world. So every day, as we move things down the production line, we're making an assessment as to whether or not it will deliver in the quarter. There were homes that were in production where we were anticipating getting certain supplies that we needed in order to meet a Q4 delivery. And once you cross kind of certain kind -- kind of critical path dates, you start to run out of days where you can compress schedules. And so candidly, things slide. Our run rate at this point in time is 100 to 150 homes a day. So you lose 2, 3, 4 days of time due to delays, and the numbers -- the numbers have been adjusted as we've indicated today. Yes. So we've got great visibility into the land that we own and the -- specifically which communities that, that land is allocated to. We've got good visibility into how those communities are moving through the entitlement and the development process. Certainly, those are subject to or run the risk of delays just like the vertical side. But given what we see in our pipeline and adjusting for what we think will be headwinds next year, we are very confident that we'll see community count growth and expansion into next year. So we'll give you the specific numbers at the end of Q4, Eric, but we're confident enough that we've hit the low point that we can give you at least a preview that we'll see expansion in Q4 and nice expansion into next year as well."

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. At that time, in order to ask a question, you may press star and then one. To withdraw your question, you may press star and two. Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Jim Zeumer. Sir, please go ahead.\nJim Zeumer: Great, thank you Jamie, and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today\u2019s call to review PulteGroup\u2019s operating and financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.  Joining me today to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s strong second quarter are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO, Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning\u2019s earnings release and the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of the call later today. Let me note that in addition to reviewing our reported Q2 results, we will also be reviewing adjusted results which exclude a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit and a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carry forwards. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning\u2019s release and within today\u2019s webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance.  As always, I want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Jim. Good morning. On today\u2019s call, we will be covering PulteGroup\u2019s financial results as well as updating you on several important initiatives we continue to advance. As Bob will detail in a few minutes, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results.  Looking at the business, along with a 28% increase in net new orders, we generated significant top line revenue growth, outstanding gross and operating margins, and a 50% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Clearly there is a lot to be excited about in our results.  Clearly financial results are important, but I believe that running a successful homebuilding business means thinking about the long term and focusing on the key drivers that we believe create shareholder value. These include attracting and retaining a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a world-class buying experience for our customers, following a disciplined capital allocation strategy, running an efficient homebuilding operation, and realizing higher returns and intelligently manning risks through time. I\u2019m proud to say that consistently executing against these key drivers has been critical to the quality of the operating results we have realized and the outstanding financial position we had established. Consistent with our constructive view of the housing market, we previously announced our intention to increase land investment in 2021. In fact, through the first six months of this year, we\u2019ve invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition and development. This is up from $1.1 billion last year and $1.5 billion in 2019, with the latter number including the acquisition of the American West assets. Given our increasing land spend, I want to emphasize that we continue to make these investments using the same disciplined approach and underwriting practices against which we have operated for most of the past decade.  In overlay to our investment process, we also continue to execute against our strategy of controlling more land via option. I\u2019m happy to report that 53% of our land was optioned at quarter end, which is approaching all-time highs, and we will of course seek to raise this percentage as market conditions permit. Although on a smaller scale compared with land, I would highlight that we continue to invest in our offsite manufacturing strategy. I\u2019m pleased to report that we recently leased a facility in Florence, South Carolina that will expand our offsite manufacturing capabilities. We expect to begin delivering product from this facility to parts of our southeastern operation in the first half of 2022. The Florence facility is our second offsite manufacturing plant and follows our earlier acquisition of ICG at the beginning of 2020. These two plants are part of our long-term strategy to address labor and related production challenges that we expect will continue impacting the future of homebuilding.  As part of our disciplined capital allocation policies, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. Through the first six months of this year, we have returned just shy of $430 million through share repurchases and dividends. You will recall our Q1 announcement of a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization. You can see that we are already putting this authorization to use. Having capital available to allocate comes from strong cash flows being generated from well run operations. Bob will provide the details, but I would like to highlight that our reported operating margins in the second quarter exceeded 18% with adjusted operating margins approaching 17%. With an industry that historically achieved operating margins of approximately 10%, our performance over the last several years is clearly breaking with this old paradigm. More broadly, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that our entire industry is working to raise this performance bar.  Finally, we believe creating long term value for our shareholders comes from generating high returns over the housing cycle. For the trailing 12 months, PulteGroup has delivered an outstanding return of 25.7% on our equity. Driving higher returns is something we\u2019ve been talking about for the past decade, so we are proud to be delivering on that objective. The returns we generate are an outcome that reflects the myriad of day-to-day decisions we make as we allocate capital and run our business. As I noted, we are making these decisions today based up on a favorable long term view of the U.S. housing market, although we appreciate recent questions about near-term conditions. As a general statement, I will tell you that housing demand was strong in the second quarter and that these trends have continued into the first few weeks of July. From Google website searches to community visits, we continue to see a very high level of consumer interest in buying new homes. Given the unusual demand dynamics created by the pandemic, we are careful when comparing 2021 to 2020, so we also look back to prior years for additional perspective. To that end, we monitor an array of traffic, conversion and sign-up trends and our local operations provide insights on what is happening on the ground in their respective markets. Based on all the metrics we monitor and consistent with our business performance, we would say that the second quarter demand in the overwhelming majority of our markets was as strong or stronger than the first 90 days of this year. I would also tell you that buyer interest in the period was stronger than the second quarter of 2019, in other words, prior to the pandemic. Buyer demand has been strong but customer feedback also hints at a sense of frustration with the lack of homes available for purchase and the rate of price appreciation they\u2019ve seen in the market.  With this as a backdrop, I would also tell you that we purposely restricted sales through lot releases or similar actions in roughly 75% of our communities across the country. These actions were taken to better align our sales efforts with our current production capacity and to begin rebuilding spec homes closer to our historic level of 25%. Said simply, we likely could have sold a lot more homes in the quarter above the 28% increase in net new orders and 40% increase in absorption pace that we reported. When we thread all these data points together, we continue to see a strong demand environment with a very high level of interest in buying a new home. As has been the case for multiple years, the ongoing strength in demand reflects powerful macro forces, including favorable demographics, an under-supply of new and resale homes, an improving economy and a supportive interest rate environment. While meaningful constraints on home availability and price increases are likely influencing short term conditions, we remain very optimistic about the long term demand trends. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan, and good morning. I\u2019m pleased to have the opportunity to review PulteGroup\u2019s second quarter results, which show our ongoing gains in key operating and financial metrics.  Starting with the income statement, wholesale revenues for the second quarter increased 31% over the comparable prior year period to $3.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 22% increase in closings to 7,232 homes, along with a 7% increase in average sales price to $447,000. While our second quarter deliveries showed nice gains over last year, they did come in below our prior guidance due directly to an incremental increase of roughly two weeks in our build cycle times in the majority of our markets. The increase in build cycle times primarily reflects ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. Consistent with comments made on recent calls, the 7% or $31,000 increase in average sales price in the second quarter reflects price increases realized in all markets and across all buyer groups. Our mix of deliveries in the quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 41% from move-up buyers, and 27% from active adult buyers, which compares to 31% first-time buyers, 44% move-up buyers, and 25% active adult buyers in the second quarter of last year. The company\u2019s net new orders for the second quarter totaled 8,322 homes, which is an increase of 28% over the second quarter of last year. In the quarter, we saw continuations of the trends we reported in the first quarter of this year, which included strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups with clear outperformance among our active adult home buyers. In the quarter, first-time orders increased 12% to 2,637 homes, move-up orders increased 15% to 3,273 homes, and active adult orders increased 81% to 2,412 homes. It\u2019s worth noting that the significant year-over-year increase in active adult orders reflects a dramatic pandemic-induced slowdown in 2020, but I would also highlight that the absolute order rate for these buyers is actually near 15-year highs. Beyond any impact the pandemic has had on our year-over-year comparisons, I refer back to Ryan\u2019s comments that our divisions were actively restricting sales in upwards of three quarters of our available communities during the second quarter. By design, these limitations had the most significant impact in our first-time and move-up communities.  During the quarter, we operated from an average of 808 communities, which is a decrease of 9% from an average of 887 communities last year and is consistent with our previous guidance. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 8%, which is down significantly from last year and consistent with the first quarter of this year. Benefiting from our strong Q2 orders, our year-over-year backlog increased by 52% to 20,056 homes. Given the strong pricing environment, the value of our backlog increased an even greater 70% to $9.8 billion.  Consistent with comments made during our first quarter earnings call, we started construction on 9,800 homes in the period. This is more than double what we started in Q2 of last year and represents a sequential increase of 17% over the number of homes started in the first quarter. As a result of the increase in our starts, we ended the second quarter with 17,344 homes under construction, which represents an increase of 58% compared to last year. Of the homes under construction, 2,233 or 13% were spec units. This percentage is up slightly from the first quarter but remains below our longer term target of 25%. Based on the fact that many of our units under construction are still early in the build cycle coupled with existing supply chain challenges, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,300 to 7,600 homes. These same forces will also impact our total deliveries for the full year. At this time, we expect full year closings of 30,500 homes, which would be an increase of 24% over full year 2020 results. As has been well reported, favorable supply-demand dynamics have supported price increases in new and existing homes across the country. Positive conditions can be seen in our average price in our backlog, which is higher by 12% over Q2 of last year to $491,000. Given higher backlog prices and the anticipated mix of home deliveries going forward, we expect our average closing price in the third quarter to be between $470,000 and $475,000. For the second quarter, we reported a home building gross margin of 26.6% compared with 23.9% last year. The 270 basis point increase, which exceeded our guidance, reflects the exceptional pricing environment we have been experiencing for a number of quarters as well as the mix of homes closed in the period. Beyond the 7% increase in the average price of homes closed, discounts in the period fell to 1.9%. This is down from 3.5% last year and represents a sequential decrease of 60 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Our second quarter margins also reflect a legal settlement of $5 million, which benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. As reflected in the increases in our sales prices and gross margin, we have been able to pass on the meaningful cost inflation we have incurred over the course of the year. At this point, we now expect house costs to be up between 9% and 11% for the full year with the peak of certain costs, driven by lumber, flowing through in the third and fourth quarters. Even with the ongoing rise in build costs, we still see opportunity for gross margins to move higher over the remaining two quarters of the year. As a result, we expect our third quarter gross margins to be 26.8% with our fourth quarter gross margin expected to be 27.3%. Our reported SG&A expense for the second quarter was $272 million or 8.4% of home sale revenues, which includes a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $319 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. For the second quarter of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $197 million or 8% of home sale revenues, and excluding the impact of a $61 million pre-tax insurance benefit and $10 million of pre-tax charges from actions taken in response to the pandemic, adjusted SG&A was $247 million or 10% of home sale revenues. Based on projected closings over the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9% to 9.5% of home sale revenues and now expect our full year adjusted SG&A to be 9.6% of home sale revenues, which represents a 20 basis point improvement compared to our previous guidance for the year. For the second quarter, our financial services operation reported pre-tax income of $51 million compared with $60 million last year. The decrease in profitability relative to recent quarters reflects the increasingly competitive market conditions that developed during the first half of the year.  In the second quarter, our reported tax expense was $136 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21.3%. In the quarter, we realized a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowance associated with projected utilization of certain state net operating loss carry forwards.  Our reported net income for the second quarter was $503 million or $1.90 per share, and our adjusted net income for the period was $456 million or $1.72 per share. The company\u2019s reported net income in last year\u2019s second quarter was $349 million or $1.29 per share, and our adjusted net income was $311 million or $1.15 per share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and a debt to capital ratio of 22.7%, which is down from 23.3% at the end of Q1 and 32.1% a year ago. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of June was 4.5%. As a reminder, our board of directors authorized a billion dollar increase to our share repurchase plan in April of this year. In the second quarter, we used $200 million of our authorization to repurchase 3.6 million shares, which represents a 1.4% reduction in our outstanding shares at an average price of $55.84 per share. In the second quarter, we also invested $986 million in land acquisition and development, bringing our year-to-date spend to $1.8 billion. As we remain constructive on the opportunities for long term housing demand, we continue to invest in our business through the same disciplined processes we\u2019ve used to build our existing land pipeline. Given our positive stance on the market, we are targeting full year investment this year of approximately $4 billion in land acquisition and development, which represents an 8% increase over our prior guidance. Inclusive of the investments made in the second quarter, we ended the period with approximately 207,000 lots owned and controlled. Of these lots, 53% are controlled through options, which is approaching all-time highs for the company. While the owned-option split can shift a little from quarter to quarter, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to increase land option to enhance returns and/or reduce market-related risks. I would highlight that our percentage of lots controlled via option has increased from 31% at the end of 2016 and we will continue to seek optionality in an increasing percentage of our controlled lots.  Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the business during the quarter and believe that we are extremely well positioned heading into the second half of the year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Before we open the call to questions, I want to briefly touch on an exciting relationship that we just announced with Invitation Homes.  As most of you know, we have been evaluating different ways for PulteGroup to get involved in the rapidly expanding long-term single family rental business. We were looking for an approach that leveraged our expertise in land acquisition and home construction with an acceptable level of risk and that generated sufficient margins and returns. I believe that we have accomplished this through our collaboration with Invitation Homes, the leader in single family rental. As outlined in the release, beginning in 2022, PulteGroup expects to design and build approximately 7,500 new homes over a five-year period for sale to Invitation Homes for inclusion in their single family rental leasing portfolio. We have already agreed to projects in the state of Florida, Georgia, California and Texas, representing an initial 1,000 homes. Under the program structure, we are effectively a preferred provider of new construction homes to Invitation.  Along with providing a strong margin and return opportunity, this relationship offers a number of other benefits. The increased construction volume allows us to further expand local market scale within the areas we currently serve. The increased inventory turn resulting from these sales can enhance overall project returns. The increased volume could allow the company to potentially pursue larger land pieces in select locations, and the relationship could also support PulteGroup\u2019s entry into select new markets we have been assessing.  We have been diligent in our efforts to find the right entry point into single family rentals and we are excited about this opportunity and the chance to work with an industry leader like Invitation Homes. Before turning this back to Jim, let me thank all of our employees for their work in delivering these exceptional financial results and, more importantly, an outstanding home buying experience for our customers. I also want to applaud our entire organization on PulteGroup being ranked among the 2021 Best Workplaces for Millennials by Fortune and Great Place to Work. Following our being named to the prestigious Fortune 100 Best Companies for Work For earlier this year, this newest ranking further builds our position as an employer of choice for all generations. As the CEO of PulteGroup, I appreciate what you do every day for our customers and for each other.  Now let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Zeumer: Great, thanks Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call to questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time on this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you, and I\u2019ll now ask Jamie to explain the process and open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Dahl from RBC. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Dahl: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, really helpful commentary just now. I wanted to start with your comment about how demand feels at least as strong in the majority of your markets over the course of 2Q as 1Q, and just as you go across maybe from a buyer segmentation standpoint, to what extent, if any, have you started to see the demand pool get a little bit thinned out by affordability as you\u2019ve continue to push price fairly aggressively?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, thanks for the question. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we really haven\u2019t. To your point, we have raised prices quite aggressively. We\u2019ve effectively limited sales through restricting lot releases and other processes we used in over 75% of our communities, so we just have not seen demand wane throughout the quarter.  As I characterized it in my prepared remarks, we think demand was at least equal to what we saw in Q1 and in some communities and some locales, even better. \nMike Dahl: Okay, thanks. Just to follow up on that as my second question, to your point, you\u2019ve got multiple prongs in terms of the ways that you\u2019ve kind of restricted and managed sales, one being phased lot releases, but I think you\u2019ve also employed, I believe you term it the easy offer process, so basically accepting bids on the lots once they\u2019re released. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on to what extent you\u2019ve employed that practice, is that across all those 75% of the communities that you\u2019re restricting, and any additional details you can give us on how that has trended as one of your--one of the tools and whether that\u2019s being used more or less now versus a couple months ago.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, it is one of the tools that we use. We find that for certain buyer groups in certain communities, it works well, Mike. I\u2019d tell you that we don\u2019t use it in every division in every community, so it\u2019s one of the tools, and to give you an exact number of how many times we used that versus other mechanisms, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve got that information at my fingertips, but a pretty high number of our divisions do use it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and for all of the detail and commentary so far. Ryan, I\u2019d love to first touch on the supply-demand environment right now. I think you mentioned 75% of communities limiting sales, which I think is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve heard from a lot of other builders. I\u2019m curious where you see that going over the next several months - on one hand, it looks like your start pace improved quite a bit, which is great; on the other hand, it seems like cycle times continue to get extended. You trimmed the closing guide for the full year a little bit, so it feels like a lot of those challenges, if anything, are not getting better, maybe getting worse a little bit.  Is there an opportunity to kind of pull back on some of those limitations, or do you actually maybe anticipate them accelerating or getting more aggressive here over the next few months to allow the supply chain to catch its breath a little bit?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Alan, good morning. Thanks for the questions. As I think Bob highlighted in some of his commentary, we\u2019d characterize the supply chain as about the same. There are different challenges that are popping up - one gets solved and then you\u2019ve got another one to deal with. It certainly has elongated our cycle time, and that\u2019s what\u2019s contributed to us adjusting our full year closing guide for the total year. With what we see today, we\u2019re not anticipating it getting any worse than what we\u2019re currently experiencing, and our hope would be as the world continues to reopen, more and more folks are vaccinated, more employers are going back to work in full capacity, that some of those supply chain related challenges would get solved or would maybe get slightly improved. That\u2019s what I would share with you on the supply side. As far as demand goes, Alan, time will tell. I would continue to reiterate what we experienced in the quarter and well into the third week of July - demand is strong, and we continue to be impressed with the appetite of the consumer and the buyer for homes in general, but specifically new homes. Keep in mind, I think all of this is being done against the backdrop of summer time, maybe the first kind of normal or semi-normal summer that we\u2019ve had in the better part of two years, so suffice to say I think there\u2019s been other distractions out there that potentially capture the attention of the consumer, and we haven\u2019t seen it have an impact on demand at this point.\nAlan Ratner: That\u2019s great to hear and very helpful. Second, I\u2019d love to spend a second or two hearing a bit more about the partnership with Invitation Homes, and what I\u2019m curious about from your perspective is 7,500 homes over five years, should we think about that as being additive to your for-sale business, or is some of that going to maybe come out of the for-sale business, recognizing it\u2019s competing for the same land, the same labor, the same materials, and it doesn\u2019t seem like those constraints are getting better anytime soon. Is the capacity there to fully make this a one plus one equals two, or should we think about this as maybe a little bit more of a hedge and maybe the business grows a bit, but not fully at that 1,500 home per year level?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Alan, it\u2019s a fair question, and I\u2019m going to give you a little bit of a, it\u2019s a bit of both, answer. We do believe that a fair number of these homes will truly be incremental to our existing for-sale business, and that would certainly be the intent. We think that this partnership will give us access to larger land parcels and allow us to build everything that we normally would have built for sale, and then incrementally do some rental units as well. Certainly I think there will be some projects where it becomes a little fungible and some of the units will come out of what historically would have been our for-sale portfolio. We\u2019ll see how the partnership plays out and what opportunities are there, but we do believe that this will become part of our growth story and we\u2019re excited about that. I\u2019d highlight, Alan as I think you know, the price points of the homes that are typically going to the rental pools are slightly smaller, more on the entry level price point, the cycle times are a little faster, the construction\u2019s a little easier, so we certainly think that aspect will help on the construction side of things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener from Keybanc. Please go ahead with your questions.\nKen Zener: Good morning everybody. \nRyan Marshall: Hi Ken.\nKen Zener: Obviously we\u2019ve had new home sales yesterday - I think it slowed sequentially and there\u2019s been some downward revisions on the government data, but you\u2019re still doing about 3.4 orders this last quarter, a bit down but above your 2.5-plus range in the past. The question is, can you talk to how the higher pace is changing the industry, the norms for you guys perhaps, and specific to that, how we should think about how you\u2019re thinking, how you\u2019re buying your land when you run your models relative to communities rising, relative to the order pace as we see it today, because you\u2019re talking about larger communities which obviously could have higher pace, but I\u2019m just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking is evolving, even how the industry is shifting, because there obviously was that pivot away from higher communities given last cycle\u2019s experience.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Ken, it\u2019s a fair question. I think, and this is going to perhaps be a boring answer, we haven\u2019t changed our thought process in terms of how we\u2019re seeking to access the land market, and more importantly what our return expectations are. Now, obviously when we look at potential transactions, the current market influences our thinking, but as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re mindful that the market is moving at a pretty fast pace today, and so we always think what happens if it goes back to what had been the norm before that, what does it do to our return expectations. On balance, our community sizes have gotten a little bit bigger but not much, honestly - they\u2019re still three years on average, our return screen is the same.  One of the nice things, and Ryan highlighted it about the relationship with Invitation Homes, is because they are going to have a need for and a desire for delivery of certain cadence of homes, coupled with the homes that we\u2019re going to build for sale, it allows for an accelerated build and delivery rate that is return enhancing, so it actually lets us look at different communities. Maybe a little bit further on the question that Ryan got asked a minute ago, it allows us to think about different land parcels, so it might be something that we would have passed on but for the relationship with Invitation Homes. All those things factor in, and so when our teams are out looking, stuff that they used to say no to, we now have a different kind of build and sell model that we can layer it into that might broaden the universe of assets that we\u2019re looking at.  Again to be clear about this, our return expectations haven\u2019t changed, and whether it\u2019s looking at things that we\u2019re going to build solely for sale or include a rental portion, we have the same return expectations around that.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, and Ken, I\u2019d also add and just kind of emphasize, I think Bob touched on it, we haven\u2019t changed our philosophy in terms of the number of years of land that we want to own. We\u2019ve also, as we highlighted in this most recent quarter, we\u2019ve gotten our land under option up to the highest that its arguably been in the last decade at 53% of our lots are controlled via option, so I think we\u2019re sticking to the fundamentals and the principles that we laid out, that we believe, to the point that Bob made, really manage risk and drive the best returns that we can get.\nKen Zener: Right, right. I appreciate that.  Bob, just during your answer, I thought of a question which I didn\u2019t think of, related to the Invitation Homes. I think your business is running very steadily, obviously, but when you look at these parcels of land, is there--I\u2019m just thinking about joint ventures or any obligations, if the world changes, are you guys--is there some type of guarantee in terms of them purchasing if you\u2019re buying the land, or is the land for these lots held differently? Thank you very much.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Ken, we do not have a joint venture. As Bob and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we have an arrangement with Invitation Homes that is on a--that\u2019s struck on a project-by-project basis, so we underwrite every project individually, as do they. We have purchase and sale agreements that are, while bigger in size, pretty normal with what we typically do in purchase and sale type agreements. We think in terms of the risk on our side, risk on their side, we think we\u2019ve effectively managed that and we\u2019re doing it in a pretty responsible way. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. Just back on the sale restrictions in, it sounded like, three-quarters of your communities, I\u2019m just curious if you could outline a little bit around what you\u2019re looking for to loosen those restrictions, if there\u2019s any targets you may have, something like specs per community or just knocking cycle time back down. Obviously it\u2019s going to be different everywhere, but just looking for any kind of guideposts on how to think about that. Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Matt, thanks for the question. You highlighted a number of them. The other one that I would add to that is the number of months that a customer will be in backlog while their home is constructed, so we ideally like to target something in the six to seven month range. We occasionally will go outside of that, but we find you go much longer than seven months, it starts to have a negative impact on the customer experience, so we will look at that as well. We also look at overall cycle time, which we\u2019ve highlighted is slightly getting expanded, and then our lot availability and our lot development times, kind of what the runway is in front of us, we evaluate that. Then you\u2019d add into that obviously production capabilities, trade availability, so do we have the opportunity to bring on more trades. In some of our entry level communities, Matt, I would highlight that we\u2019re building more specs in those communities, and so in those communities we actually don\u2019t want to sell the home until it reaches a later stage of production, and so in those communities, we\u2019re trying to catch up. We are certainly still selling and we\u2019re open--it\u2019s mostly in our Texas communities, we\u2019re open and we\u2019re selling but we\u2019re intentionally really holding back as we put more homes into the spec pipeline.\nMatthew Bouley: Great, really helpful color there. Thanks for that, Ryan. My follow-up, I wanted to ask about pricing power actually on the first-time buyer portfolio relative to, I guess, move-up and active adult communities. Obviously your first-time is not entirely the lowest end entry level, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing that first-time buyer perhaps getting stretched at all relative to those buyers that are selling an existing home and realizing the equity in that. Thank you.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. Interestingly, the average sales price for our first-time buyers is $338,000 in the most recent quarter - that\u2019s up 6% over the prior year. That\u2019s against the combined portfolio up 7%, and just for perspective, our move-up was up about 9%, our active adult was up about 8%, so it\u2019s all. In the prepared remarks, we highlighted this - it\u2019s kind of all markets, all buyers that pricing is pretty consistent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks a lot, guys. You put out a pretty aggressive start outlook last quarter for this quarter, and you pretty much hit - 9,800 starts, I think you said is what you did in 2Q. I was curious as to whether this is a level of start activity that you intend to sustain or perhaps even increase over the next several quarters, if you could give us some visibility on that because obviously that\u2019s a level of starts which is running considerably higher than your closings, and it seems like you\u2019ve indicated that the lengthening of the cycle time has started to level out, basically, that you\u2019re not seeing cycle times meaningfully increase still as we\u2019re in the third quarter here. I just wanted to clarify what your outlook is for starts.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Stephen, thanks for the question. We did have a really good start quarter, and our field production and construction teams, I think did an amazing job getting the 9,800 homes in the ground in the quarter. We\u2019d highlighted last quarter, and I\u2019d highlight it again today, that\u2019s not a rate that we would intend to run at through the balance of the year. The Q2 number was really meant to get some of our outsized backlog into the production pipeline, as well as to rebuild our spec inventory. We think we\u2019ve made meaningful progress against that. Our Q3 and our Q4 start rate will certainly be up over prior year, although we probably expect it to be below the 9,800 that we did in Q2. As we think about production capacity, we think we\u2019ve got a lot of inherent ability and inherent capacity built into our system, and certainly as we look to grow the company, we look to grow in the future years, we\u2019ll evaluate what that spec or that ultimate start rate should ultimately be over several cycles.\nStephen Kim: Got it, thanks very much for that. Then your gross margin was pretty strong, and you\u2019ve given some guidance that you\u2019re going to have peak lumber costs, basically, running through in 3Q and 4Q. I\u2019m curious as to whether--you\u2019ve helped us understand what the year-over-year headwind from lumber you\u2019re expecting to be embedded within your 3Q and 4Q guidance, and in terms of basis points, is it a year-over-year headwind of, whatever, a couple hundred basis points, that kind of thing? Then secondarily, if 3Q and 4Q is peak lumber, is it fair to think that given what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the lumber prices recently, that 2022, the beginning of \u201922 margins should benefit, kind of like the reverse of the headwind from higher lumber in 3Q and 4Q maybe getting the benefit in first half of 2022?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Stephen, fair question. We\u2019re not going to give a guide on margins for next year. Fair to say that if lumber prices stay where they are, it will be a tailwind. In terms of absolute impact on our margin, I think we had highlighted this in the most recent call, historically we would have thought the lumber pack ex-labor would have been 3% to 5% of the ASP. We had highlighted that had run up to probably 6% to 8%, so in real dollar terms on a $440,000 ASP, $25,000 to $30,000 in lumber cost in a house, so you can kind of think through if pricing falls, and depending on where you think lumber goes, random lags OSD falling at different rates, the benefit will be--you know, if we can get back to that 3% to 5% of ASP, pretty sizeable. Where pricing is, what lumber does, how that happens, again we\u2019ve seen different rates of change for different components, but if things go as it appears they\u2019re looking, it\u2019ll be a little bit of a benefit in fiscal \u201922.\nStephen Kim: For sure, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, just wanted to touch on the offsite manufacturing facility you\u2019re expanding to a second location. I know historically you haven\u2019t necessarily given any quantitative measures on margin performance or anything like that. I was just hoping you could give us an update, either any quantitative on the margin side or just qualitatively what you\u2019re seeing - better cycle times, lower warranty costs, and any update or metrics you can put around that would be helpful. \nRyan Marshall: Hey Truman, it\u2019s Ryan - good morning. We\u2019re really excited about the second location for our ICG operation. To your point, we have not provided margin guidance at this point. Even with this second facility, we think the amount of our business that it\u2019s impacting is still pretty small. As we continue to scale, we get to a third plant, a fourth plant, and it\u2019s starting to impact a bigger part of our business, I think that that insight will become more relevant and certainly more appropriate. Qualitatively, I think the thing that I would expound and elaborate on, we\u2019re really happy with what it\u2019s doing for our operation. In terms of the quality of the product that\u2019s coming out of the facilities, it is top notch. We\u2019ve got a really talented team of designers and operators that are running that plant. The constructability of those components that are happening in the field are really exceeding our expectations, and it\u2019s serving saving a significant cycle time on the frame shell components of the homes, depending on how many of the components are actually going in. Talented group of folks that are running the ICG operation for us. We\u2019re going to continue to grow it from here, and our hope would be in the coming six to nine months, we can have some type of an investor day or some type of an event where we can show you all firsthand what this factory does for us.\nTruman Patterson: Okay, thanks for that. You know, Ryan, when I think about--you know, you all are accelerating your land investment quite a bit this year, and that\u2019s going to impact how your company looks a couple years out. When I think back over the past handful of years, you seem like you\u2019ve been a little bit more flexible as to which end markets you\u2019re willing to go in, just purely based off of returns, whatever drives the highest return.  With that in mind, are there any areas, recognizing how large of an investment you\u2019re making this year, entry level, move-up, active adult, is it in line with where you\u2019ve been historically, or are there any product categories that you\u2019re rotating towards, geographies, anything along those lines to help us out?\nRyan Marshall: In terms of consumer groups, Truman, very consistent with where we\u2019ve been targeting historically. As a refresher, 35% of the business first-time entry level, 40% of the business with our Pulte branded move-up family communities, and 25% in active adult, so really no change to that focus. In terms of markets, not a whole lot of change there either, other than we have highlighted that we\u2019ve recently re-entered Denver. We are in the triad area of North Carolina, and we\u2019ve started to kind of expand into some of the markets like Columbia and Greenville as well, leveraging some of our existing operations. You\u2019re starting to see a little bit of incremental land spend in a few of those places, but other than that, it\u2019s largely consistent with our current footprint.\nTruman Patterson: All right, thanks for taking my questions, and good luck on the upcoming quarter.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Truman.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks, good morning everyone. First question I had was on the active adult business - obviously a really strong result from an order growth standpoint, and actually looking at it on a two-year stack, if I\u2019m doing the math right, it looks like orders were up 40% versus 2019 second quarter, versus first-time up 30%. The question is, obviously you\u2019ve had the first-time buyer really strong more broadly speaking over the last two, three years, I think that by and large continues to today, but the active adult obviously has historically allowed for great customer diversification. At the same time, you\u2019ve had somewhat of a longer land position for that business, and over time you\u2019ve shifted from kind of the bigger battleships to the more nimble positions, maybe 500,000 lot type communities. Just curious how you see the business over the next two or three years. Is this stronger growth rate that I referred to allowing you guys to maybe cycle through land a little bit more quickly and allow that business to even result in an overall consolidated Pulte continuing to shift more towards that lot optioning and improve your overall financial profile?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, we\u2019re excited about what the Del Webb brand is doing for the company, and specifically the recent performance. We had a great quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the absorptions were up 76%. Now admittedly, that\u2019s against a pretty soft quarter last year when that consumer wasn\u2019t traveling, but on an absolute new order basis, we reached levels that we haven\u2019t seen in a long, long time. We like the way the brand\u2019s performing, we think we\u2019ve got some great assets. Our newer vintage Del Webb communities are even better located than what historical ones were, and some of those historical battleships, given that we\u2019ve had them for a long time, they\u2019re in pretty damn good locations as well, just as time has allowed them to mature and they\u2019ve become closer in. The other advantage that we have with some of those legacy communities is we do have land there. We\u2019re able to develop that land and run those communities at a little faster rate in the current environment, which is certainly helping with return and overall inventory turn.  In terms of what the brand does for us over the next two to three years, as we\u2019ve highlighted in some of our comments, we\u2019re very constructive on the overall U.S. housing market. We believe with that market staying healthy, that will bode well for this active adult consumer as well as they\u2019re typically selling their resale home and looking to move and do other things. We\u2019re certainly bullish on the entire business, but I think maybe extra positive on the active adult component. \nMichael Rehaut: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, appreciate it. Second question, perhaps just to think about sales pace in the back half of the year, you mentioned that you would expect 3Q, 4Q starts pace to be below the rate you did in the second quarter. Historically in the back half of the year, sales pace has moderated roughly 10% sequentially in the third quarter, another 15% off of that in the fourth quarter. At the same, obviously, you\u2019ve talked about the fact that demand well exceeds your ability to--well exceeds supply as you\u2019re limiting lot releases, etc. How should we think about sales pace in the back half with all that considered? Is a reversion towards that historical sequential decline, roughly speaking, how we should be thinking about things, or should we be considering a different dynamic given the strong, continued strong demand backdrop that you\u2019ve described?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on order rates for Q3 or Q4, but I would tell you that given the current environment and how strong demand is, and the fact that we are intentionally and purposefully restricting sales, I think it\u2019s difficult to use historical models to predict the next couple of quarters. We like the way we\u2019re operating, we are very optimistic and bullish on consumer demand. We\u2019re going to continue to sell as many as we think we can produce and our land pipeline will--our developed land pipeline will allow for, but at this point that\u2019s probably all I can give you in terms of future order growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you, good morning everyone. My first question is around the SG&A - you know, you\u2019ve obviously done a good job of leveraging that, and the guidance is lower than where we were coming into the year. Can you talk about the key drivers of that and how we should be thinking about it going forward as you continue to expand the business?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, hey Susan, it\u2019s Bob. I think very consistently, we\u2019ve answered this question over time. As the business grows, we certainly expect that we will get leverage from that, and I think if you go back probably five years and look, with the exception of sort of the pothole that got created because of the basic elimination of spend during the pandemic, you\u2019ve seen a very consistent inverse trend - as our revenues have increased, our SG&A as a percentage of those revenues has decreased in relative step order to the size. I think we\u2019ve done a very nice job through time of managing against our expense--our expenses against our revenue stream. I think it\u2019s a pretty good blueprint for what you can and should expect from us going forward. We\u2019ve said it before - we likely will never be the cheapest company in terms of SG&A spend. There are things that we invest in, whether it\u2019s IT or marketing related things, that we think benefit the business and contribute to both the engagement of our workforce, the experience of our consumers, the gross margins that we generate, so we think we run a pretty tight ship. We think we\u2019re leveraging as we grow, and I think that\u2019s how you should think about it as we go forward.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. My next question is around capital allocation. I know you mentioned that you\u2019re forecasting or estimating about $4 billion of land spend this year, which is up about 8%. Obviously you\u2019ve got plenty of cash on the balance sheet, you\u2019ve been buying back the stock. What else should we be kind of expecting in terms of capital allocation, anything else that\u2019s changed in there?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, good news, Susan, is nothing\u2019s changed. We still have a desire to invest in the business when we\u2019re constructive, as we are today. I think you see that both in terms of the year-over-year growth and even the increase that we\u2019ve highlighted for investment this year, up 8% versus what we thought at the beginning of the year, which is a pretty sizeable increase over the prior year. We\u2019ve obviously demonstrated a willingness to work the dividend through time, the share repurchase authorization and the activity during this most recent quarter, and you should expect us to be doing, on some level, all of those things going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, I\u2019ll start with a high level question. The industry seems to be struggling to meet even this 1.5 million starts for this year, given the supply chain constraints. Do you think we will be ready for a higher number next year, say 1.8 million starts or so? Any high level thoughts on what needs to happen to get us to a higher number, and is it even realistic to expect a 1.8 next year?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, candidly I think the supply chain challenges are bigger than just housing. I think nearly every industry across the globe is dealing with shortages of various materials. Sometimes those are major parts and pieces and sometimes they\u2019re microchips that cost less than a dollar. I think in terms of does the industry have capacity, I think we do. I think we have the land pipeline, I think we have the labor base, I think there\u2019s just some sand in the gears related to certain materials. The things that are having the biggest impact on us right now are windows, to a lesser degree certain lumber components and components needed to manufacture lumber-related pieces, and then candidly, I think in terms of the ability to increase start rate bigger than the current supply challenges, it\u2019s going to be land, titled developed land, so we\u2019ve all really worked to put more on the balance sheet to move things through the entitlement process, but over the long haul I think that\u2019s the constraint that we should be focused on, as opposed to what I think are mostly short term supply chain issues.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it, but you think from a land perspective, 1.8 which is pretty much under control of the housing industry, not necessarily the [indiscernible] industry, within what is in your control with this land, 1.8 is still not necessarily off the table, it\u2019s still on the table?\nRyan Marshall: Well, I only control what goes on inside of our shop. I know that we\u2019ve got a healthy land pipeline, as indicated by the 207,000 lots we control. In terms of what the entire industry has and where that\u2019s at in the overall entitlement development process, I\u2019d probably leave that up to economists that are smarter than I am.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will be ending today\u2019s question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Zeumer for any closing comments.\nJim Zeumer: Jamie, thank you. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time this morning. Certainly available for the remainder of the day to answer any other questions, and we will look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks Jim. Good morning. On today's call, we will be covering PulteGroup's financial results as well as updating you on several important initiatives we continue to advance. As Bob will detail in a few minutes, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results.  Looking at the business, along with a 28% increase in net new orders, we generated significant top line revenue growth, outstanding gross and operating margins, and a 50% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Clearly there is a lot to be excited about in our results.  Clearly financial results are important, but I believe that running a successful homebuilding business means thinking about the long term and focusing on the key drivers that we believe create shareholder value. These include attracting and retaining a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a world-class buying experience for our customers, following a disciplined capital allocation strategy, running an efficient homebuilding operation, and realizing higher returns and intelligently manning risks through time. I'm proud to say that consistently executing against these key drivers has been critical to the quality of the operating results we have realized and the outstanding financial position we had established. Consistent with our constructive view of the housing market, we previously announced our intention to increase land investment in 2021. In fact, through the first six months of this year, we've invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition and development. This is up from $1.1 billion last year and $1.5 billion in 2019, with the latter number including the acquisition of the American West assets. Given our increasing land spend, I want to emphasize that we continue to make these investments using the same disciplined approach and underwriting practices against which we have operated for most of the past decade.  In overlay to our investment process, we also continue to execute against our strategy of controlling more land via option. I'm happy to report that 53% of our land was optioned at quarter end, which is approaching all-time highs, and we will of course seek to raise this percentage as market conditions permit. Although on a smaller scale compared with land, I would highlight that we continue to invest in our offsite manufacturing strategy. I'm pleased to report that we recently leased a facility in Florence, South Carolina that will expand our offsite manufacturing capabilities. We expect to begin delivering product from this facility to parts of our southeastern operation in the first half of 2022. The Florence facility is our second offsite manufacturing plant and follows our earlier acquisition of ICG at the beginning of 2020. These two plants are part of our long-term strategy to address labor and related production challenges that we expect will continue impacting the future of homebuilding.  As part of our disciplined capital allocation policies, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. Through the first six months of this year, we have returned just shy of $430 million through share repurchases and dividends. You will recall our Q1 announcement of a $1 billion increase to our repurchase authorization. You can see that we are already putting this authorization to use. Having capital available to allocate comes from strong cash flows being generated from well run operations. Bob will provide the details, but I would like to highlight that our reported operating margins in the second quarter exceeded 18% with adjusted operating margins approaching 17%. With an industry that historically achieved operating margins of approximately 10%, our performance over the last several years is clearly breaking with this old paradigm. More broadly, I think it's important to acknowledge that our entire industry is working to raise this performance bar.  Finally, we believe creating long term value for our shareholders comes from generating high returns over the housing cycle. For the trailing 12 months, PulteGroup has delivered an outstanding return of 25.7% on our equity. Driving higher returns is something we've been talking about for the past decade, so we are proud to be delivering on that objective. The returns we generate are an outcome that reflects the myriad of day-to-day decisions we make as we allocate capital and run our business. As I noted, we are making these decisions today based up on a favorable long term view of the U.S. housing market, although we appreciate recent questions about near-term conditions. As a general statement, I will tell you that housing demand was strong in the second quarter and that these trends have continued into the first few weeks of July. From Google website searches to community visits, we continue to see a very high level of consumer interest in buying new homes. Given the unusual demand dynamics created by the pandemic, we are careful when comparing 2021 to 2020, so we also look back to prior years for additional perspective. To that end, we monitor an array of traffic, conversion and sign-up trends and our local operations provide insights on what is happening on the ground in their respective markets. Based on all the metrics we monitor and consistent with our business performance, we would say that the second quarter demand in the overwhelming majority of our markets was as strong or stronger than the first 90 days of this year. I would also tell you that buyer interest in the period was stronger than the second quarter of 2019, in other words, prior to the pandemic. Buyer demand has been strong but customer feedback also hints at a sense of frustration with the lack of homes available for purchase and the rate of price appreciation they've seen in the market.  With this as a backdrop, I would also tell you that we purposely restricted sales through lot releases or similar actions in roughly 75% of our communities across the country. These actions were taken to better align our sales efforts with our current production capacity and to begin rebuilding spec homes closer to our historic level of 25%. Said simply, we likely could have sold a lot more homes in the quarter above the 28% increase in net new orders and 40% increase in absorption pace that we reported. When we thread all these data points together, we continue to see a strong demand environment with a very high level of interest in buying a new home. As has been the case for multiple years, the ongoing strength in demand reflects powerful macro forces, including favorable demographics, an under-supply of new and resale homes, an improving economy and a supportive interest rate environment. While meaningful constraints on home availability and price increases are likely influencing short term conditions, we remain very optimistic about the long term demand trends. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Before we open the call to questions, I want to briefly touch on an exciting relationship that we just announced with Invitation Homes.  As most of you know, we have been evaluating different ways for PulteGroup to get involved in the rapidly expanding long-term single family rental business. We were looking for an approach that leveraged our expertise in land acquisition and home construction with an acceptable level of risk and that generated sufficient margins and returns. I believe that we have accomplished this through our collaboration with Invitation Homes, the leader in single family rental. As outlined in the release, beginning in 2022, PulteGroup expects to design and build approximately 7,500 new homes over a five-year period for sale to Invitation Homes for inclusion in their single family rental leasing portfolio. We have already agreed to projects in the state of Florida, Georgia, California and Texas, representing an initial 1,000 homes. Under the program structure, we are effectively a preferred provider of new construction homes to Invitation.  Along with providing a strong margin and return opportunity, this relationship offers a number of other benefits. The increased construction volume allows us to further expand local market scale within the areas we currently serve. The increased inventory turn resulting from these sales can enhance overall project returns. The increased volume could allow the company to potentially pursue larger land pieces in select locations, and the relationship could also support PulteGroup's entry into select new markets we have been assessing.  We have been diligent in our efforts to find the right entry point into single family rentals and we are excited about this opportunity and the chance to work with an industry leader like Invitation Homes. Before turning this back to Jim, let me thank all of our employees for their work in delivering these exceptional financial results and, more importantly, an outstanding home buying experience for our customers. I also want to applaud our entire organization on PulteGroup being ranked among the 2021 Best Workplaces for Millennials by Fortune and Great Place to Work. Following our being named to the prestigious Fortune 100 Best Companies for Work For earlier this year, this newest ranking further builds our position as an employer of choice for all generations. As the CEO of PulteGroup, I appreciate what you do every day for our customers and for each other.  Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Yes Mike, thanks for the question. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we really haven't. To your point, we have raised prices quite aggressively. We've effectively limited sales through restricting lot releases and other processes we used in over 75% of our communities, so we just have not seen demand wane throughout the quarter.  As I characterized it in my prepared remarks, we think demand was at least equal to what we saw in Q1 and in some communities and some locales, even better. Yes Mike, it is one of the tools that we use. We find that for certain buyer groups in certain communities, it works well, Mike. I'd tell you that we don't use it in every division in every community, so it's one of the tools, and to give you an exact number of how many times we used that versus other mechanisms, I'm not sure that I've got that information at my fingertips, but a pretty high number of our divisions do use it. Yes Alan, good morning. Thanks for the questions. As I think Bob highlighted in some of his commentary, we'd characterize the supply chain as about the same. There are different challenges that are popping up - one gets solved and then you've got another one to deal with. It certainly has elongated our cycle time, and that's what's contributed to us adjusting our full year closing guide for the total year. With what we see today, we're not anticipating it getting any worse than what we're currently experiencing, and our hope would be as the world continues to reopen, more and more folks are vaccinated, more employers are going back to work in full capacity, that some of those supply chain related challenges would get solved or would maybe get slightly improved. That's what I would share with you on the supply side. As far as demand goes, Alan, time will tell. I would continue to reiterate what we experienced in the quarter and well into the third week of July - demand is strong, and we continue to be impressed with the appetite of the consumer and the buyer for homes in general, but specifically new homes. Keep in mind, I think all of this is being done against the backdrop of summer time, maybe the first kind of normal or semi-normal summer that we've had in the better part of two years, so suffice to say I think there's been other distractions out there that potentially capture the attention of the consumer, and we haven't seen it have an impact on demand at this point. Yes Alan, it's a fair question, and I'm going to give you a little bit of a, it's a bit of both, answer. We do believe that a fair number of these homes will truly be incremental to our existing for-sale business, and that would certainly be the intent. We think that this partnership will give us access to larger land parcels and allow us to build everything that we normally would have built for sale, and then incrementally do some rental units as well. Certainly I think there will be some projects where it becomes a little fungible and some of the units will come out of what historically would have been our for-sale portfolio. We'll see how the partnership plays out and what opportunities are there, but we do believe that this will become part of our growth story and we're excited about that. I'd highlight, Alan as I think you know, the price points of the homes that are typically going to the rental pools are slightly smaller, more on the entry level price point, the cycle times are a little faster, the construction's a little easier, so we certainly think that aspect will help on the construction side of things. Hi Ken. Yes, and Ken, I'd also add and just kind of emphasize, I think Bob touched on it, we haven't changed our philosophy in terms of the number of years of land that we want to own. We've also, as we highlighted in this most recent quarter, we've gotten our land under option up to the highest that its arguably been in the last decade at 53% of our lots are controlled via option, so I think we're sticking to the fundamentals and the principles that we laid out, that we believe, to the point that Bob made, really manage risk and drive the best returns that we can get. Yes Ken, we do not have a joint venture. As Bob and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we have an arrangement with Invitation Homes that is on a--that's struck on a project-by-project basis, so we underwrite every project individually, as do they. We have purchase and sale agreements that are, while bigger in size, pretty normal with what we typically do in purchase and sale type agreements. We think in terms of the risk on our side, risk on their side, we think we've effectively managed that and we're doing it in a pretty responsible way. Yes Matt, thanks for the question. You highlighted a number of them. The other one that I would add to that is the number of months that a customer will be in backlog while their home is constructed, so we ideally like to target something in the six to seven month range. We occasionally will go outside of that, but we find you go much longer than seven months, it starts to have a negative impact on the customer experience, so we will look at that as well. We also look at overall cycle time, which we've highlighted is slightly getting expanded, and then our lot availability and our lot development times, kind of what the runway is in front of us, we evaluate that. Then you'd add into that obviously production capabilities, trade availability, so do we have the opportunity to bring on more trades. In some of our entry level communities, Matt, I would highlight that we're building more specs in those communities, and so in those communities we actually don't want to sell the home until it reaches a later stage of production, and so in those communities, we're trying to catch up. We are certainly still selling and we're open--it's mostly in our Texas communities, we're open and we're selling but we're intentionally really holding back as we put more homes into the spec pipeline. Yes Stephen, thanks for the question. We did have a really good start quarter, and our field production and construction teams, I think did an amazing job getting the 9,800 homes in the ground in the quarter. We'd highlighted last quarter, and I'd highlight it again today, that's not a rate that we would intend to run at through the balance of the year. The Q2 number was really meant to get some of our outsized backlog into the production pipeline, as well as to rebuild our spec inventory. We think we've made meaningful progress against that. Our Q3 and our Q4 start rate will certainly be up over prior year, although we probably expect it to be below the 9,800 that we did in Q2. As we think about production capacity, we think we've got a lot of inherent ability and inherent capacity built into our system, and certainly as we look to grow the company, we look to grow in the future years, we'll evaluate what that spec or that ultimate start rate should ultimately be over several cycles. Hey Truman, it's Ryan - good morning. We're really excited about the second location for our ICG operation. To your point, we have not provided margin guidance at this point. Even with this second facility, we think the amount of our business that it's impacting is still pretty small. As we continue to scale, we get to a third plant, a fourth plant, and it's starting to impact a bigger part of our business, I think that that insight will become more relevant and certainly more appropriate. Qualitatively, I think the thing that I would expound and elaborate on, we're really happy with what it's doing for our operation. In terms of the quality of the product that's coming out of the facilities, it is top notch. We've got a really talented team of designers and operators that are running that plant. The constructability of those components that are happening in the field are really exceeding our expectations, and it's serving saving a significant cycle time on the frame shell components of the homes, depending on how many of the components are actually going in. Talented group of folks that are running the ICG operation for us. We're going to continue to grow it from here, and our hope would be in the coming six to nine months, we can have some type of an investor day or some type of an event where we can show you all firsthand what this factory does for us. In terms of consumer groups, Truman, very consistent with where we've been targeting historically. As a refresher, 35% of the business first-time entry level, 40% of the business with our Pulte branded move-up family communities, and 25% in active adult, so really no change to that focus. In terms of markets, not a whole lot of change there either, other than we have highlighted that we've recently re-entered Denver. We are in the triad area of North Carolina, and we've started to kind of expand into some of the markets like Columbia and Greenville as well, leveraging some of our existing operations. You're starting to see a little bit of incremental land spend in a few of those places, but other than that, it's largely consistent with our current footprint. Thanks Truman. Yes Mike, we're excited about what the Del Webb brand is doing for the company, and specifically the recent performance. We had a great quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the absorptions were up 76%. Now admittedly, that's against a pretty soft quarter last year when that consumer wasn't traveling, but on an absolute new order basis, we reached levels that we haven't seen in a long, long time. We like the way the brand's performing, we think we've got some great assets. Our newer vintage Del Webb communities are even better located than what historical ones were, and some of those historical battleships, given that we've had them for a long time, they're in pretty damn good locations as well, just as time has allowed them to mature and they've become closer in. The other advantage that we have with some of those legacy communities is we do have land there. We're able to develop that land and run those communities at a little faster rate in the current environment, which is certainly helping with return and overall inventory turn.  In terms of what the brand does for us over the next two to three years, as we've highlighted in some of our comments, we're very constructive on the overall U.S. housing market. We believe with that market staying healthy, that will bode well for this active adult consumer as well as they're typically selling their resale home and looking to move and do other things. We're certainly bullish on the entire business, but I think maybe extra positive on the active adult component. Yes Mike, we're not going to give any guidance on order rates for Q3 or Q4, but I would tell you that given the current environment and how strong demand is, and the fact that we are intentionally and purposefully restricting sales, I think it's difficult to use historical models to predict the next couple of quarters. We like the way we're operating, we are very optimistic and bullish on consumer demand. We're going to continue to sell as many as we think we can produce and our land pipeline will--our developed land pipeline will allow for, but at this point that's probably all I can give you in terms of future order growth. Yes, candidly I think the supply chain challenges are bigger than just housing. I think nearly every industry across the globe is dealing with shortages of various materials.

Well, I only control what goes on inside of our shop. I know that we've got a healthy land pipeline, as indicated by the 207,000 lots we control. In terms of what the entire industry has and where that's at in the overall entitlement development process, I'd probably leave that up to economists that are smarter than I am."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks Ryan, and good morning. I'm pleased to have the opportunity to review PulteGroup's second quarter results, which show our ongoing gains in key operating and financial metrics.  Starting with the income statement, wholesale revenues for the second quarter increased 31% over the comparable prior year period to $3.2 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 22% increase in closings to 7,232 homes, along with a 7% increase in average sales price to $447,000. While our second quarter deliveries showed nice gains over last year, they did come in below our prior guidance due directly to an incremental increase of roughly two weeks in our build cycle times in the majority of our markets. The increase in build cycle times primarily reflects ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. Consistent with comments made on recent calls, the 7% or $31,000 increase in average sales price in the second quarter reflects price increases realized in all markets and across all buyer groups. Our mix of deliveries in the quarter included 32% from first-time buyers, 41% from move-up buyers, and 27% from active adult buyers, which compares to 31% first-time buyers, 44% move-up buyers, and 25% active adult buyers in the second quarter of last year. The company's net new orders for the second quarter totaled 8,322 homes, which is an increase of 28% over the second quarter of last year. In the quarter, we saw continuations of the trends we reported in the first quarter of this year, which included strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups with clear outperformance among our active adult home buyers. In the quarter, first-time orders increased 12% to 2,637 homes, move-up orders increased 15% to 3,273 homes, and active adult orders increased 81% to 2,412 homes. It's worth noting that the significant year-over-year increase in active adult orders reflects a dramatic pandemic-induced slowdown in 2020, but I would also highlight that the absolute order rate for these buyers is actually near 15-year highs. Beyond any impact the pandemic has had on our year-over-year comparisons, I refer back to Ryan's comments that our divisions were actively restricting sales in upwards of three quarters of our available communities during the second quarter. By design, these limitations had the most significant impact in our first-time and move-up communities.  During the quarter, we operated from an average of 808 communities, which is a decrease of 9% from an average of 887 communities last year and is consistent with our previous guidance. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 8%, which is down significantly from last year and consistent with the first quarter of this year. Benefiting from our strong Q2 orders, our year-over-year backlog increased by 52% to 20,056 homes. Given the strong pricing environment, the value of our backlog increased an even greater 70% to $9.8 billion.  Consistent with comments made during our first quarter earnings call, we started construction on 9,800 homes in the period. This is more than double what we started in Q2 of last year and represents a sequential increase of 17% over the number of homes started in the first quarter. As a result of the increase in our starts, we ended the second quarter with 17,344 homes under construction, which represents an increase of 58% compared to last year. Of the homes under construction, 2,233 or 13% were spec units. This percentage is up slightly from the first quarter but remains below our longer term target of 25%. Based on the fact that many of our units under construction are still early in the build cycle coupled with existing supply chain challenges, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,300 to 7,600 homes. These same forces will also impact our total deliveries for the full year. At this time, we expect full year closings of 30,500 homes, which would be an increase of 24% over full year 2020 results. As has been well reported, favorable supply-demand dynamics have supported price increases in new and existing homes across the country. Positive conditions can be seen in our average price in our backlog, which is higher by 12% over Q2 of last year to $491,000. Given higher backlog prices and the anticipated mix of home deliveries going forward, we expect our average closing price in the third quarter to be between $470,000 and $475,000. For the second quarter, we reported a home building gross margin of 26.6% compared with 23.9% last year. The 270 basis point increase, which exceeded our guidance, reflects the exceptional pricing environment we have been experiencing for a number of quarters as well as the mix of homes closed in the period. Beyond the 7% increase in the average price of homes closed, discounts in the period fell to 1.9%. This is down from 3.5% last year and represents a sequential decrease of 60 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Our second quarter margins also reflect a legal settlement of $5 million, which benefited gross margin by approximately 20 basis points. As reflected in the increases in our sales prices and gross margin, we have been able to pass on the meaningful cost inflation we have incurred over the course of the year. At this point, we now expect house costs to be up between 9% and 11% for the full year with the peak of certain costs, driven by lumber, flowing through in the third and fourth quarters. Even with the ongoing rise in build costs, we still see opportunity for gross margins to move higher over the remaining two quarters of the year. As a result, we expect our third quarter gross margins to be 26.8% with our fourth quarter gross margin expected to be 27.3%. Our reported SG&A expense for the second quarter was $272 million or 8.4% of home sale revenues, which includes a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. Excluding this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $319 million or 9.8% of home sale revenues. For the second quarter of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $197 million or 8% of home sale revenues, and excluding the impact of a $61 million pre-tax insurance benefit and $10 million of pre-tax charges from actions taken in response to the pandemic, adjusted SG&A was $247 million or 10% of home sale revenues. Based on projected closings over the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9% to 9.5% of home sale revenues and now expect our full year adjusted SG&A to be 9.6% of home sale revenues, which represents a 20 basis point improvement compared to our previous guidance for the year. For the second quarter, our financial services operation reported pre-tax income of $51 million compared with $60 million last year. The decrease in profitability relative to recent quarters reflects the increasingly competitive market conditions that developed during the first half of the year.  In the second quarter, our reported tax expense was $136 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21.3%. In the quarter, we realized a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowance associated with projected utilization of certain state net operating loss carry forwards.  Our reported net income for the second quarter was $503 million or $1.90 per share, and our adjusted net income for the period was $456 million or $1.72 per share. The company's reported net income in last year's second quarter was $349 million or $1.29 per share, and our adjusted net income was $311 million or $1.15 per share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and a debt to capital ratio of 22.7%, which is down from 23.3% at the end of Q1 and 32.1% a year ago. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio at the end of June was 4.5%. As a reminder, our board of directors authorized a billion dollar increase to our share repurchase plan in April of this year. In the second quarter, we used $200 million of our authorization to repurchase 3.6 million shares, which represents a 1.4% reduction in our outstanding shares at an average price of $55.84 per share. In the second quarter, we also invested $986 million in land acquisition and development, bringing our year-to-date spend to $1.8 billion. As we remain constructive on the opportunities for long term housing demand, we continue to invest in our business through the same disciplined processes we've used to build our existing land pipeline. Given our positive stance on the market, we are targeting full year investment this year of approximately $4 billion in land acquisition and development, which represents an 8% increase over our prior guidance. Inclusive of the investments made in the second quarter, we ended the period with approximately 207,000 lots owned and controlled. Of these lots, 53% are controlled through options, which is approaching all-time highs for the company. While the owned-option split can shift a little from quarter to quarter, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to increase land option to enhance returns and/or reduce market-related risks. I would highlight that our percentage of lots controlled via option has increased from 31% at the end of 2016 and we will continue to seek optionality in an increasing percentage of our controlled lots.  Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the business during the quarter and believe that we are extremely well positioned heading into the second half of the year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yes Ken, it's a fair question. I think, and this is going to perhaps be a boring answer, we haven't changed our thought process in terms of how we're seeking to access the land market, and more importantly what our return expectations are. Now, obviously when we look at potential transactions, the current market influences our thinking, but as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we're mindful that the market is moving at a pretty fast pace today, and so we always think what happens if it goes back to what had been the norm before that, what does it do to our return expectations. On balance, our community sizes have gotten a little bit bigger but not much, honestly - they're still three years on average, our return screen is the same.  One of the nice things, and Ryan highlighted it about the relationship with Invitation Homes, is because they are going to have a need for and a desire for delivery of certain cadence of homes, coupled with the homes that we're going to build for sale, it allows for an accelerated build and delivery rate that is return enhancing, so it actually lets us look at different communities. Maybe a little bit further on the question that Ryan got asked a minute ago, it allows us to think about different land parcels, so it might be something that we would have passed on but for the relationship with Invitation Homes. All those things factor in, and so when our teams are out looking, stuff that they used to say no to, we now have a different kind of build and sell model that we can layer it into that might broaden the universe of assets that we're looking at.  Again to be clear about this, our return expectations haven't changed, and whether it's looking at things that we're going to build solely for sale or include a rental portion, we have the same return expectations around that. Yes, it's a fair question. Interestingly, the average sales price for our first-time buyers is $338,000 in the most recent quarter - that's up 6% over the prior year. That's against the combined portfolio up 7%, and just for perspective, our move-up was up about 9%, our active adult was up about 8%, so it's all. In the prepared remarks, we highlighted this - it's kind of all markets, all buyers that pricing is pretty consistent. Yes Stephen, fair question. We're not going to give a guide on margins for next year. Fair to say that if lumber prices stay where they are, it will be a tailwind. In terms of absolute impact on our margin, I think we had highlighted this in the most recent call, historically we would have thought the lumber pack ex-labor would have been 3% to 5% of the ASP. We had highlighted that had run up to probably 6% to 8%, so in real dollar terms on a $440,000 ASP, $25,000 to $30,000 in lumber cost in a house, so you can kind of think through if pricing falls, and depending on where you think lumber goes, random lags OSD falling at different rates, the benefit will be--you know, if we can get back to that 3% to 5% of ASP, pretty sizeable. Where pricing is, what lumber does, how that happens, again we've seen different rates of change for different components, but if things go as it appears they're looking, it'll be a little bit of a benefit in fiscal '22. Yes, hey Susan, it's Bob. I think very consistently, we've answered this question over time. As the business grows, we certainly expect that we will get leverage from that, and I think if you go back probably five years and look, with the exception of sort of the pothole that got created because of the basic elimination of spend during the pandemic, you've seen a very consistent inverse trend - as our revenues have increased, our SG&A as a percentage of those revenues has decreased in relative step order to the size. I think we've done a very nice job through time of managing against our expense--our expenses against our revenue stream. I think it's a pretty good blueprint for what you can and should expect from us going forward. We've said it before - we likely will never be the cheapest company in terms of SG&A spend. There are things that we invest in, whether it's IT or marketing related things, that we think benefit the business and contribute to both the engagement of our workforce, the experience of our consumers, the gross margins that we generate, so we think we run a pretty tight ship. We think we're leveraging as we grow, and I think that's how you should think about it as we go forward. Yes, good news, Susan, is nothing's changed. We still have a desire to invest in the business when we're constructive, as we are today. I think you see that both in terms of the year-over-year growth and even the increase that we've highlighted for investment this year, up 8% versus what we thought at the beginning of the year, which is a pretty sizeable increase over the prior year. We've obviously demonstrated a willingness to work the dividend through time, the share repurchase authorization and the activity during this most recent quarter, and you should expect us to be doing, on some level, all of those things going forward."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Zeumer. Please go ahead.\nJames Zeumer: Thank you, Sarah, and good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining today call to review PulteGroup's operating and financial results for our first quarter ended March 31, 2021. While it has only been a year, our Q1 2021 earnings call will obviously be very different discussion than we had this time last year. I'm joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slide that accompany today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. Before we get started, let me highlight that in addition to reviewing our reported first quarter results, we will also discuss our adjusted results, which exclude both a $61 million pre-tax charge associated with a debt tender completed in the quarter, and a $10 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. For purposes of comparison, we will also discuss prior your Q1 earnings adjusted for a $20 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Jim, and good morning. As detailed in this morning's release, our financial results show exceptional first quarter performance for PulteGroup. From double-digit growth in signups, revenues, and earnings to enhanced liquidity and a $1 billion expansion of our share repurchase authorization we posted a tremendous start to 2021. Beyond company specific gains, our first quarter results reflect the ongoing strength of homebuying demand throughout all segments of our business. It is worth highlighting that I believe the strength of the market is due in part to a significant housing shortage in this country. That shortage has been years in the making and will take years to correct. I think the first two sentences from a recent Wall Street Journal article aptly summarize the current state of housing supply in the U.S. The U.S. housing market is 3.8 million single family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand according to a new analysis by mortgage finance company Freddie Mac. The estimate represents a 52% rise in the nation's home shortage, compared with 2018, the first time Freddie Mac quantified the shortfall. Beyond this long-term structural shortage, COVID-19 has also resulted in a growing desire for single family living and has changed what homebuyers want and need from their homes. We believe these new wants and needs are often best met through the floor plans and features available on new construction. Add these dynamics do supportive demographics, low interest rates, and an improving economy, and you get the tremendous demand environment we're experiencing today. The strength in demand is reflected in our strong order growth for the quarter. In total, our net new orders were up 31% over the last year, while our absorption pace was up 37%. On a unit basis, this was the highest [first quarter finance], we've reported in over a decade and at $4.6 billion, our highest reported quarterly sales value ever. I would highlight that the strong demand we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 has continued into the first three plus weeks of April. We continue to see high traffic volumes in our communities and buyers anxious to purchase a new home. Working within the strong demand environment, we continue to improve our operating and financial performance. Our pricing strategies and disciplined business practices helped us to generate a gross margin of 25.5%, and an adjusted operating margin of 14.6% in the quarter. The resulting cash flows were then available to fund the future growth of our business and an increase in our ongoing return of excess capital to shareholders. At a very basic level, this is the model that we have been refining for the past decade. It starts with running a higher performing homebuilding operation, seeking to capture incremental gains in all areas of the business. It also includes investing in high quality projects and increasing our use of land purchase options to improve cash flows, and overall asset efficiency, while delivering consistently strong returns on investment and equity. Having built a home building operation that we believe can routinely generate strong returns and cash flows, we then allocate capital to support our long-term success and reward our shareholders. As we have highlighted many times, our highest priority is investing in our business through the acquisition and development of land assets that can generate required risk adjusted returns. To that end, since 2016, we have invested $14.6 billion in land acquisition and development and have done so while building a more efficient land pipeline. To clearly demonstrate the progress we have made, at the end of 2016, we own 99,000 watts, while controlling an additional 44,000 watts via option. Today, we actually own 5,000 fewer lots than five years ago and have more than doubled the lots we hold via option to 100,000. This significant and continuing change in the composition of our land pipeline has allowed us to increase the returns we generate while also helping us to reduce land related market risk. As you know, we've also made the return of funds to our shareholders an integral part of our capital allocation. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $154 million of stock repurchased in the first quarter. On that front, I am happy to note that this morning's announcement that our board approved an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization. And finally, as you saw in the first quarter, we were also prepared to allocate capital with a view towards further strengthening our balance sheet and reduce in our financial leverage. By paying down $726 million of debt in the quarter, including the successful tender for $300 million of our nearest dated outstanding debt, we were able to lower our debt-to-capital ratio on a gross basis to 23.3%. To be paying down debt and returning significant funds to shareholders, while targeting a 30% increase in our land acquisition and a development in 2021 says a lot about our expectations for the earnings power and the financial strength of this business. I think it also reflects a more return oriented shareholder friendly approach toward operating our business.  In fact, I think there is an ongoing maturation of the broader homebuilding industry in terms of its ability to generate higher returns with reduced risk. Given changes in the industry's operating and return profile, we believe investors can grow increasingly comfortable about investing in the sector over the entire housing cycle. With the opportunity for sustained high levels of housing demand, I believe PulteGroup's unique operating strategy has us well positioned to compete and to continue to grow our business. Beyond the financial strength that I discussed, I believe that our size and diversity provide important advantages. For example, a key driver to our order growth in the first quarter was the ongoing recovery in demand among active adult consumers. A year of being separated from their kids and grandkids has been more than enough for this buyer group. With vaccinations now moving into high gear, our active adult buyers are anxious to get on with their lives, including moving into a new Del Webb community. In conclusion, 2021 has gotten off to an excellent start for our company. With ongoing strong demand that exceeds available supply, a backlog value of $8.8 billion and our tremendous financial strength and flexibility, I am excited about what we can accomplish this year. Let me now turn the call over to Bob.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Jumping right into our operating results, home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 17% over last year to $2.6 billion. The higher revenues for the period reflect the 12% increase in closings to 6,044 homes, coupled with a 4% increase in average sales price to $430,000. While home closings for the period were up more than 12% over last year, deliveries came in slightly below our guidance with the shortfall resulting primarily from the severe weather in Texas. 4% or $17,000 increase in average sales price realized in the quarter benefited for price increases across all buyer groups and was led by a 6% increase in ASP for our active adult closings. The buyer mix of closings in the first quarter is comparable with the prior year and included 33% from first time buyers, 43% from move up buyers, and 24% from active adult buyers. As Ryan mentioned, our net new orders in the first quarter were up 31% over last year to 9,852 homes. We experienced strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups with notable ongoing strength among our active adult buyers. In the first quarter, orders among our first time buyers increased 39% to 3,303 homes, while move up orders gained 18% to 4,040 homes and active adult voters increased a robust 49% to 2,509 homes. 49% year-over-year increase in active adult closings reflects the impact of the slowdown in sales in the last two weeks of March last year. But I would highlight that the 2,500 active adult orders this year represent a first quarter high dating back almost 15 years. I would also point out the buyer demand was consistently strong during each month of the quarter even when interest rates increased during the period. The 31% increase in orders could have been higher, but our divisions continued to actively manage sales in the quarter to match production rates and to help maximize project specific returns. Along with raising prices and a 100% of our communities to help cover cost inflation and moderate sales, all of our divisions used [flat releases] to more directly manage sales in some or all of their communities. For the first quarter, we operated from an average of 837 communities, which is down 4% from last year's average of 873 communities. The year-over-year decline in community count is consistent with our prior comments and reflects the impact of our decision to slow land spend when the pandemic first hit in March of last year along with the accelerated closeout of communities resulting from the ongoing elevated pace of sales. Consistent with the overall strength of the market, our cancellation rate in the quarter declined by more than 500 basis points from last year to just 8%, and we ended the quarter with a backlog of 18,966 homes, which is an increase of 50% over last year. On $1 basis, our backlog increased 58% to $8.8 billion. On a year-over-year basis, we increased the number of homes we started in the quarter by 25% to 8,364 homes, which helped to raise our total homes under construction by 22% to 14,728 homes. Of these homes, 1,798 or 12% were spec units, which on a percentage basis is down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year. Given market conditions, we have continued to work with our trade partners to further increase productions and expect to increase overall starts to at least 10,000 homes in the second quarter of this year. This would be an increase of at least 20% over the first quarter of this year. Based on the stage of construction for the 14,728 homes currently under construction, we expect deliveries in the second quarter to be in the range of 7,400 to 7,700 homes. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 27% in deliveries over the second quarter of last year.  Based on the ongoing strength of buyer demand and with almost 19,000 houses in backlog, we are raising our guidance for full-year closings to 32,000 homes. This is an increase of 7% from our prior guide of 30,000 homes and represents a 30% increase in deliveries for the year versus the prior year. The strong pricing environment has helped to lift the average sales price in our backlog by 5% over last year to $465,000. Given the backlog ASP and the anticipated mix of deliveries, we expect our average closing price in the second quarter to be in the range of $440,000 to $445,000. For the full-year, we now expect our average closing price to be between $450,000 and $455,000. Our homebuilding gross margin for the first quarter was 25.5%, which is an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year, and a sequential gain of 50 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our prior guidance, benefited from the exceptionally strong pricing environment for sold and spec homes, and for the mix of homes close to the period. In addition to the 4% increase in year-over-year ASP, our gross margins also benefited from lower sales discounts of 2.5% in the quarter, which represents a decrease of 110 basis points for the same period last year, and a decrease of 50 basis points for the fourth quarter of last year. As has been well reported, material and labor costs continue to move higher being led by lumber prices, which now seem to reach new highs every day. While we now expect our house costs, excluding land to be up 6% to 8% for the year, the strong demand environment is allowing us to pass through these costs in the form of both higher base sales prices, and lower discounts. Given these cost price dynamics, we expect gross margins to move higher throughout the remainder of 2021. As a result, we expect to realize sequential gains of approximately 50 basis points in each of the three remaining quarters this year, which would have us in the range of 27% for the fourth quarter of 2021. In the first quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues. Excluding the 10 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million, or 10.9% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense for the quarter of $264 million, or 11.9% of home sale revenues. We are adding people to handle our higher construction volumes, but we still expect to realize sequential overhead leverage with the second quarter SG&A expense in the range of 9.9% to 10.3%.  And for the full-year, we now expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of homebuilding revenue to be approximately 9.8%. As Jim noted, we did record a $61 million pre-tax charge in the period relating to the cash tender offer for 300 million of our senior notes that we completed in the first quarter. Turning to Pulte Financial Services, they continue to report outstanding financial results with pre-tax income more than tripling to $66 million, which compares to $20 million in the first quarter of last year. The large increase in pre-tax income reflects favorable competitive dynamics in the market, as well as higher loan production volumes resulting from the growth in our closings, and a 150 basis point increase in capture rate to 88%. Tax expense for the first quarter was $90 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than our recent guidance, primarily due to benefits related to equity compensation recorded in the period. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5% for the balance of the year, including the benefit of energy tax credits we expect to realize this year. In total, for the quarter, we reported net income of $304 million or $1.13 per share. Our adjusted net income for the period was $343 million or $1.28 per share. In the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net income of $204 million or $0.74 per share, and adjusted net income of $219 million or $0.80 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 23.3%, down from 29.5% at the end of the year as we use available cash to pay down $726 million of senior notes in the first quarter.  Our net debt to capital ratio was 5.5% at the end of the quarter. Along with paying down debt during the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million common shares at a cost of $154 million for an average price of $46.11 per share. As Ryan mentioned, given the strength of our business and expectations for continued strong cash flows, and with our existing repurchase authorization down to approximately $200 million at the end of the quarter, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization. The return of excess capital to our shareholders remains a priority and as such, we expect to remain a consistent and systematic buyer of our shares. In the first quarter we invested $795 million in land acquisition and development, including the lots we put under control through these investments, we ended the first quarter with approximately 194,000 lots under control, of which 94,000 were owned and 100,000 were controlled through options. With 51% of our lots now controlled via option, we have surpassed our initial target of 50% owned and 50% optioned, and expected that the percentage of option lot can move even higher. Consistent with our outstanding financial results, I'm pleased to report that earlier this month, Standard & Poor\u2019s upgraded PulteGroup\u2019s debt to investment grade. This means that our senior notes are now rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. It's been a long process, but I'm extremely proud of the improvements we've been able to achieve in our credit metrics. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Bob. Before opening the call to questions there are two final topics that I want to quickly review. First, as one of the nation's largest home building companies, we recognize and accept the important responsibilities we have to continue advancing sound ESG policies. In today's world success is judged not just by what we do, but also considers how we do. As such, along with actively working to improve how we operate, we're advancing our associated environmental, social, and governance reporting. To that end, along with all of our other accomplishments, in the first quarter, we launched a new section of our website called Pulte Cares. In addition to housing information on our efforts to run a sustainable business that supports the communities we serve, the site also contains our reporting against the sustainability accounting standards board\u2019s standards for our industry. This is the first year reporting against the SASB standards, and we look forward to showing our progress in future updates we'll be posting to the site. Finally, I would like to give a big shout out to the entire PulteGroup family for being ranked on the Fortune 100 list of Best Companies to work for. Since the founding of our company, we have viewed our culture as a critical and competitive advantage. The Fortune 100 list is built on an analysis conducted by the great place to work organization, which is based on employee surveys from thousands of companies. In our case, they surveyed 100% of our employees. To make the Fortune 100 list is an accomplishment, but to make it for the first time when we are operating in a global pandemic is clear and resounding statement about our people and the culture they have built inside of our organization. I truly could not be prouder of our company and specifically of our field leaders who do so much to support our people, and help them to be engaged, especially during these challenging times. My heartfelt thanks to all of you. Let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJames Zeumer: Great, thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many as possible during the remaining time in this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sarah, you can now open the call for questions. We'll get started.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC. Please go ahead.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Congrats on those accomplishments on the results. My first question is on active adults, it's good to see that buyer group continuing to rebound. I'm curious, you know, as you look at the buyers that are coming in the door today, is there any change in buyer profile that you're seeing kind of post-COVID now, whether it's where are these buyers coming from? What features are they looking for in the homes? What amenities are they looking for in the community? Is this any anything that you're seeing that may or may not be different will be great to hear?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks for the question, Mike. And just to clarify your question about buyer profile is specific to the active adult consumer or about all consumers?\nMike Dahl: Specific to active adult.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, really no change, Mike, in the makeup of that buyer group, the places they're coming from, and the things that they're asking for, I think largely remain the same as what we've experienced over the last, you know, four to five years.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Okay. My second question is, is around the margins, that's a great trajectory through the year and I was hoping, you know, when we think about, kind of the cost inflation guide relative to the margins, if you could give us a sense of how that cost inflation trajectory looks, because it would seem like, you know, by the time you get to 4Q, you may, maybe this isn't going to [be peak], but you may be at kind of peak cost inflation yet you're guiding to a gross margin north of 27%, and maybe you can just give a little bit more color on that trajectory of costs alongside the pricing and margin curve to give us a better sense of that?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike, just to clarify, you know, if you add the sequential 50 basis points per quarter that would get us to around 27, not north of 27, in terms of the margin. And certainly what we have seen is an acceleration in cost lumber being the primary driver of that. I think everybody is well aware, it's at all time highs. You know, we're hopeful that supply will come to that market, and that pricing will wane somewhat.  You know, we've been waiting for that and haven't seen it yet. But, you know, we have updated our guide in terms of what the inflationary aspect of the sticks and bricks is, you know we've been at or near 5%, 6%, we're now at 6% to 8%. And depending on what lumber does, that could move a little bit even higher than that.  Having said that, you know, we've got a really strong pricing environment right now. It's accelerated through the year. And so as we look at the production and our build out for the year, we see being able to cover those cost increases, enough, obviously, to lead to that 50 basis point, kind of sequential movement in margin through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the great results. You know, Ryan, I'd love to drill in a little bit more, in terms of your expectation for starts to accelerate to over I think you said 10,000, in the second quarter, it's certainly encouraging because I think that there's probably a view out there that, you know, the only thing really limiting orders at this point is production. And, you know, recognizing there's some seasonality in that start number. You know, if you just kind of annualize that, it would seem like you're gearing the business up to produce a lot more homes, and you're going to deliver this year. So, I'm curious if you could talk a little bit more about, you know, how you're getting that starts growth, you know, that 20% sequential improvement? Are these new labor relationships that you're forming? Is it just the trades, ramping up hiring and production from that standpoint? Is it anything related to the, you know, the vertical integration that's perhaps improving your efficiency there? And then just tying in cycle times, and how those have been trending into that discussion, as well would be great?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Alan, good morning. It's Ryan, I appreciate the question. We are proud of the quarter and we're very excited about how the balance of the years is shaping up. We've been working hard on the production environment for the last, you know, two to three quarters, as we always do. But you know, certainly in this period of time, when we've got unprecedented demand, the production machine becomes more important than ever. We do believe that the size of our business, the way we run our business, the relationships that we've nurtured and fostered with our trade partners over the years are really paying dividends for us. And that's the, you know, Alan, that's the primary driver. This led us to, you know, the point where we can make the 25% plus increase in production in Q2, you know, moving to Q1 rather, and then moving to almost 10,000 units in Q2. So, we're very pleased with how the production machine is moving. It's not without its challenges, and Bob's highlighted some of those on the cost front. We're certainly seeing some challenges, you know, with certain commodities, windows, appliances, a few things like that. But, you know our procurement team has done just an outstanding job in managing some of those minor speed bumps in the road You know, last part of your question Alan about cycle time, we are seeing in certain markets, you know, some incremental days being added to the overall cycle time because of some of those supply chain constraints, but we believe we've factored all of those into the guide that we've given for not only Q2 closings, but also, you know Q2 start rates.\nAlan Ratner: Great. And on that point, you know, I know you guys are not, you know, huge spec builder, but I'm just curious if you've changed your sales approach at all given, you know, those cycle times extending, given the cost environment, are you, you know, perhaps waiting more until the home is framed or started before starting up before selling homes or are you still, you know, kind of in the mix of your business, perhaps is it still a lot front loaded before the home is started? Just trying to get some insight into whether you're concerned about visibility into costs and things like that, when you're starting the sales process?\nRyan Marshall : Yeah, Alan, we're certainly concerned about the cost increases and that, you know, I think Bob's answer to the prior question highlighted that, you know, we've \u2013 it's part of the reason that we've moved our guide in terms of expectations on cost increases up, because, you know, things are getting more expensive. We are in certain consumer groups, most notably, in the lower price points, we are waiting to sell those homes later, starting them with specs, and we're waiting to sell those as they get later into the production cycle. You know, it's really allowing us to do two things, we're getting kind of current day sales price, and we've got better understanding on the delivery timing, and you know, what the cost of those homes are? The other thing I would add, Alan, it was a question that was part of your first question, and that's around our start rate, and whether or not you know, we're ramping up for more deliveries, and it's really about our spec inventory. We've historically run around 25% to 30% of our total production volume of spec, you heard in Bob\u2019s prepared remarks that we're running at 12% today. And so part of the incremental start rate will be to rebuild that spec pipeline that we'd like to carry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. The first question I had was just on some of your comments around April, and you know, how to think about the current demand backdrop, you know, you mentioned that you're seeing continued strength into the month, and you have many builders right now that are managing pace that could be selling stronger than they allow for, you know, but you know, obviously, you have still often managed pace with production. So, I\u2019m curious, you know, in terms of the strength that you've seen into April, if the first quarters pace is something that, you know, given what you're seeing in the marketplace, you think might be sustainable, because typically you do have a 5%, roughly 5% decline in sales pace in to 2Q due to seasonality. I'm wondering if, you know, if [your comments] on April, and just the overall demand backdrop, we should be expecting, you know, the current sales pace of nearly four per month to continue into the second quarter?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Mike, it's Ryan. Good morning. And where we typically see seasonality in Q2 is into the May and June part of Q2. April generally tends to be fairly in line with March. We've seen, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we've seen the first three weeks of April continue in a very strong fashion. So, you know, time will tell what kind of seasonal adjustment we see in May and June.  We're not giving any kind of a forecast on that. I think you've heard from us and a number of other builders that have recently reported that demand is really strong, and we've had to limit sales in nearly every community, either via lot release or price increases or in most cases, both.  So you know, we'll have to see how the, you know, the back two months of the quarter play out when you take into consideration unprecedented demand, along with, you know, what's been a historical or slightly seasonal fall off. But you know, all things, all other things being equal, Mike, the business environment right now, is incredibly strong for a number of reasons. And you know, it's a good time to be a homebuilder.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. No, I appreciate that. Second question, you know, on all the progress with the gross margins, obviously very impressive. You know, the 27% exit rate this year would, you know, start to match your prior peak gross margins from the last cycle, if you were to annualize it, you know, it's certainly one of the concerns that we hear from investors around, you know, maintaining this level of profitability over the next couple of years, if to the extent that demand moderates at all. I was wondering if you have any comments around, you know, if there's any perhaps structural improvements that, you know or other changes to the business model, perhaps that make you a little more comfortable that this higher level of profitability in gross margins can be sustained over the next couple of years?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Mike, thanks for the question. You know, we haven't given any kind of a guide for forward, you know, periods beyond what we've done in 2021. You know, as your question about structural changes in the business, I think we have made some real structural businesses, structural changes in the way that we operate our business. We've talked a lot about those, and we talked a lot about them in this current, you know, in this current release.  You know, I would, you know, continue to reiterate and remind everybody that we are running a business that's focused on generating return. That's what we believe creates value for our shareholders. So while the gross margins are nice, and we're certainly enjoying a very rich margin right now, that's not the number one or the only thing that we focus on when we're managing land investment, when we're managing risk, when we're managing capital allocation in a way that allows us to not only grow our business, but to take that excess cash that's being generated by the business, and we're returning that to shareholders. And I think what you're getting out of that story, Mike is a, you know, a very attractive return on equity profile that, you know, we're proud of, and I think our shareholders are very happy to have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nTruman Patterson: Ryan, Bob, Jim, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. First, on active adult demand, clearly very robust, how sustainable do you think that is? You know, does it remain one of the better performers performing segments throughout 2021? And if so, you know, absorptions in the segment for you all, you know are clearly elevated, just given the 49% growth, just how repeatable is this performance? You know, your Del Webb when we think about the legacy communities, generally larger communities, you know, can you just run those a bit harder than your other communities? Just wanted to get your take there as to how sustainable that performance is?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Truman, it's a good question. One of the things that \u2013 and we just, we looked at, I looked at it yesterday that the traffic, foot traffic through the door of our doors of our Del Webb communities continues to be very strong through the first three weeks of April. So, you know, we're very pleased with that. We like the way that that brand is operating right now, you know, over the last kind of 5 years to 7 years, we've made some shifts in the way that we build those communities, the way that we monetize them, and the way that we create the lifestyle. And, you know, as I think most of you appreciate, the most important thing with our Del Webb brand is the lifestyle that we offer, the home is almost secondary. In this post COVID environment, I think what we're seeing is consumers really value the ability for outdoor lifestyle type activities and events that allow you to be connected with other people, but still maintain some level of, kind of social distance. And the web communities offer that and so, you know, we made reference to the fact that after a year of being kind of locked inside that fire group is ready to kind of get on with life and get on with retirement. And so, you know, we're happy with that. The other thing, you know, that I'd highlight Truman that's an important part of our story and our diversified consumer offering is, we've got a big move up business, and that move up business remains very strong. And so that, you know, typically what happens is that active adult buyer, when they're selling their home, it's going to a move up buyer, which allows them to go do a lot of things and gives them great flexibility moving into the Del Webb community. So, you know, the tight supply environment on the resale side of the business, I think is a very good forward indicator of how strong the Del Webb business continue to be.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. And then just on, you know, some of your larger, I'll just call them battleship Del Webb legacy communities, do those allow for higher absorption bases or are they kind of too small to necessarily move the needle [indiscernible]?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Truman so, you know, we\u2019ve got, we're down to about six, five or six of those really large battleship Del Webb communities. There's a good land pipeline in all of those communities, and we are seeing very high absorption rates out of those legacy communities. You know, we've said, for a long time that, you know, if the market came back in such a way we could let the volume in those communities run a little more wide open given the land runway, and we're certainly doing that right now. It's a smaller percentage of the overall business. So, you know, while it moves, the needle is not going to move the needle as much as maybe what it once would have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteven Kim: Yeah, thanks, guys. Exciting quarter, fun times. Couple of your competitors last week talked about conducting a stress test on their backlog and kind of concluded that mortgage rates could rise to like 4.2%. And they still wouldn't really see much of an impact to their backlog. I was wondering whether or not you had done a stress test like that. And then following up on Mike's question about peak margins, you know we've also been hearing a lot of people talking about peak margins. And, you know, I've been pushing back and I just love to have you weigh in on some of the things that more specifically that we pointed out to see whether you agree or disagree, we pointed out, you know, virtual tours and appointment scheduling drives reduce selling costs. You know, you have input cost inflation that is depressing your 2021 margins, actually, and so whenever that begins to moderate, you should get a benefit next year, you have lower interest costs, you know, it's accentuated by your recent debt pay down. And I would imagine you're probably also moving into some larger communities designed to run at a somewhat higher rate of absorptions. And so all of these things should theoretically be structural margin improvements, I was wondering if you agreed with that. \nBob O'Shaughnessy: Alright. So to the first of your two questions. Steven, you know, did we do a stress test? I'm not sure what a stress test is on your backlog. We are always working with our backlog, though. You know, we actively manage them through the build cycle. And I would tell you that there are many things that can and might happen in a rising rate environment, and we would work with those consumers. You know, there are different products that can be offered. So yeah, I would agree that the strength of our backlog with 750 FICO scores, rising interest rates like that would not put our buyers in jeopardy. To your question on peak margins, you know there's so much that goes into that. What's the demand environment? What's the land environment? What type of product are we building? Having said that, I think your points are valid, whether they support higher margins or not structurally over time, I think they benefit the business. So, you mentioned virtual tours or selling costs. Yes, that's an enhancement interest. Certainly, we will get a benefit through time. You know, the $726 million that we paid down this quarter is $34 million in interest cost, which will ultimately come through as lower cost of sales. It'll take a little while because we capitalize it. So, there are a number of things that will benefit us through time. But they will be determinants of our margin, but so will the land cost, so will the vertical construction costs, and so will our selling prices. So to Ryan's earlier comment, you know, we underwrite against return, you guys have heard that from us a bunch. We obviously seek to maximize the margin that we are able to achieve. And we've got some tailwinds, but we've got some headwinds too in the form of lumber, etcetera. So, you know, Ryan said, it's a good time during the homebuilding business, it is. You know, we're enjoying very good margins. And we see them expanding through the year. So, I think that's a real positive. \nSteven Kim: Yeah, absolutely, it's encouraging. And thanks for the guidance out to 4Q that I think was really helpful. You have a business that you acquired a year ago, the ICG business, which operates a little more indoors, perhaps then, I guess you can call it indoors, a lot of air ventilation \u2013 was curious as to whether you could comment on the degree to which ICG has already begun to improve or aid your ability to ramp starts? Or perhaps, was that business a little bit more impacted by you know, COVID restrictions, you know, I know they're in Florida, so maybe not, but just wonder if you could provide a little bit more insight into how ICG is contributing?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. So Steven, we're very pleased with the ICG acquisition. We highlighted that, you know, on our Q1 or our Q4 call last quarter. You know, it highlights that the, you know, the business that we bought really only impacts our Jacksonville kind of North Florida business. And so, it's pretty small in terms of the overall impact of the company, but it has had a meaningful impact on our Jacksonville business. And so, we like kind of the fruits of what, you know, the fruits that we're getting off of that tree, I think are, you know, really good. And it's part of the reason that we're excited about, you know, getting close to announcing the location of the second plant. We've got, you know, we're down to, kind of a final couple of sites that will be the location for that. And you know, in short order, we'll be able to make a bigger announcement on that. And it's all part of, kind of the vision and the strategy that we had for ICG. And how do we see that playing out for our business over the next, you know, six to eight years, and we think there's a lot of benefits that will be generated for this company based on that platform.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results. Ryan, you made a comment in your prepared remarks that the homebuilding industry can generate, I think you said higher returns at reduced risk. And if I take that in tandem with your other comment that pulled these option land position can move higher than 50%, just love to hear elaboration on both of those points, just why the industry is structurally improved? If it is simply the option market opening up or what else you meant by that and specifically for Pulte, you know, how to think about where your option mix can go? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Matt, good morning. I appreciate the comment. And really, you know, what we believe has happened, and so what we know has happened inside of our own company, and what we believe has happened inside of the industry is there is a better balance of risk that's being taken onto the company's balance sheet. And most notably, a more disciplined approach to capital allocation. If you go back a decade, 15 years in this industry, you know, it was very boom and bust all of the free cash flow in an upcycle was put into land. And then that land was harvested over the, you know, the following years. And sometimes you got caught in a cycle with the capital allocation philosophy that you're seeing from Pulte, and I think you're seeing elements of it from the entire industry. There's less owned land on the balance sheet, there's more options, there's more free cash being generated. Dividends are being paid, there is share repurchase programs in place, there's less debt. All of those things, I think warrant a, you know, a much different, kind of look from the investment community that I think how the industry has historically been viewed.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it? No, interesting. That is a helpful color. And then second one, I wanted to drill down into the cancellations actually. I know you set it down to 8%, which is a nice downtick, but you know, on an absolute basis, depending on how they're performing, it's still a big enough number to move the needle. My question is, in this market, are you finding that you're actually able to price higher on those canceled homes and perhaps realize a higher margin? And I imagine that that's a typical, but what if anything from that is contemplated in your gross margin guidance? Thank you.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: You know, candidly that's not a big determinant in our forward guide, because there is very little of it. I mean, at 8% that is as low a cancellation rate and I can recall in 10 years in the business, you know, it's down sizably from last year, and even for those recent sequential quarter. And I think what it shows is the strength of the market, people who are under contract want to close because they know how hard it is to find something else to buy if they weren't to buy from us. But to your point, yes, if somebody fell out of contract, you know, halfway through the process with us, at least today, we would be able to sell it for more than we had sold it to them for, but that's not a big driver of our margin guide at all.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the general path of community count, due the balance of 2021 and maybe into 2022?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Carl. Good morning. Good to good to hear from you this morning. Certainly the increase in the business that we have guided to for 2021 has, you know, given us the opportunity to close out of some communities a little earlier than we expected. If you went back to the guide that we had previously given, we had indicated that our community count guide was going to be down in the 5% range. We'd update that today to suggest that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, this quarter this year versus the same quarter last year, our expectation is that we'll be down 5% to 10% for the balance of the year. So, for the second, third, and fourth quarter that would be our guide. We have not given any kind of indications on 2022 at this point.\nCarl Reichardt: All right, thanks. And then just on the active adult, and everyone is talking more about this, but the build times for active adult shorter or longer than the core product or if [is contract to close] shorter or longer? And then is part of the strength in the margin guide for the balance of the year, a mix shift in some meaningful way to higher margin active adults? Thanks.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: No real difference in the cycle time. And in terms of the mix shift, you know, what we'll actually see is more of a mix shift and it's modest from move up to first time, an entry level. And so you know, active adult will be pretty consistent year-over-year and for the balance of this year. So, it's really that mix shift to the first time that's \u2026\nRyan Marshall: \u2026influencing the margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'll tag along on that community count commentary. So, you raised your closing units within your guide, but you're lowering your community can grow, suggesting, you know, community sizes have increased, did I read that right, and if so, are you able to comment on the size of your communities now and compare it to historical? What I'm also trying to determine is, how much of that increase in absorption pays, you witnessed in Q1 is kind of driven by a larger community versus sure sell-through?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, good morning. I think I understand most of the question. And you know, the makeup of our communities are largely the same over the last three or so years other than our big Del Webb communities. Our average community count size is about 130 lots. So, we don't have you know, other than a few of the legacy large Del Webb communities, we don't have, you know massive communities where you can really choose the absorption rate. And then, you know, in terms of community count, the only other part of the question that I would offer there is that, you know we have been very aggressive in the amount of incremental land spend that we're putting into the business, as we, you know, rebuild the land pipeline for 2022 and beyond. The only other thing that, you know is probably worth highlighting in terms of absorption paces is the mix shift of our business into entry level. And Bob highlighted on the prior question that we are seeing some of a shift from move up into entry level. And you'll recall, you know, going back three to four years, four years now, 4.5 years when I came into the chair as CEO, we talked about shifting some of our move up business into entry level. We've done that, and as you see that coming through on the closing side, those entry level communities typically come with higher per community absorption paces.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it. That's helpful. My second follow up is on the state of pricing. Obviously, it's pretty strong now, but any thoughts going into next year? Obviously, do you expect to probably give back some of the price that you've gained from all the inflationary in pricing power that you're getting at this point in time. Just curious, you know, what are your expectations exiting the year, especially next year? And what are some of the drivers you'd point to as we try to assess how pricing is stronger or not to the rest of the year?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. We haven't given any guide on our expectations for pricing next year, you know, what I would share is that currently we're sitting at a guide of 6% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. We've, for the last three to four years prior to 2021, we were in the 1% to 2% year-over-year increase range. So, you know, we've seen unprecedented increases in cost. You know, my hope would be that, but that would start to temper. Certainly a big driver of this year's increases is lumber, and we're at kind of unprecedented highs for lumber. You know, our analysis suggest that there's plenty of raw material. The constraint really seems to be on the sawmills, and we are seeing some additional capacity start to come online. So, you know, if we can see, you know, some moderation in the lumber market. And the industry can kind of continue to run at pretty efficient levels that we're at today. My hope would be that, you know, we could see some pullback and overall cost increases next year, relative to where we've been sitting this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lovallo: Hey, guys, thank you for fitting me in here. First question is, you know, lumber costs, as you mentioned have been very well telegraphed, and I think for structural panels as well. But you know, where else are you guys seeing inflation? We've heard [cement availability] and price has been \u2013 was becoming more of a problem. And I'm curious also, which you might be seeing on the labor front?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, well, [cement] very local, right, because the distribution ranges is pretty tight. And yes, where you've got markets where you've got activity, you're going to see pricing, and that's very consistent with what we typically see. You know, in terms of the labor market, you know, certainly it is a busy market out there. People have choices on where to work. Ryan mentioned earlier, the call, you know, we've obviously stepped up our production. You know, we've got good relationships with our trades, but it costs money to make people come to our job site today. And so that's built into that increase to the 6% to 8%. I wouldn't characterize it as hateful at the moment. You know, there is, you know, there is capacity out there. For some of the trades you have to pay to get them on the jobsite, though. But those are the, you know, as always, lumber and labor are going to be the two primary drivers of cost for us.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. That's helpful. And then can you quantify the weather impact on the Texas \u2013 in Texas on closings? And was that the entirety of the [miss in the] quarter?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. [Mike], the miss that we had relative to our guide was largely driven by the weather in Texas. It was unlike any winter storm that Texas has seen and it shut that operation down for the better part of two weeks. And so, you know, our expectation is, we'll work to get the majority of that back in the second quarter, John, and, you know, we think other than that the, you know, the production machine, as I'd indicated in one of the earlier questions, is running quite well. And we'd like the rate of upstarts that we're seeing out of the business.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please go ahead. \nAlex Barron: Yeah, thanks, guys. And congratulations on the great job here. Hopefully, you could elaborate on the comment about active adults coming back, and it sounded like it was related to the vaccines, but, you know, just if you could elaborate on what you're hearing from the field, on that topic?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Alex, it's Ryan, thanks for the question. We're really excited about what we're seeing out of the active adult performance. You know, I think anecdotally we're saying that we're seeing that buyer, you know, reemerge in all aspects of their life because of their confidence around the vaccine. So, I think that's certainly a positive. I highlighted, you know, a few questions ago that the strength of the move up market is, we think also really helping that business because it's very easy for that active adult buyer to sell their home right now. They're selling it at very high prices. And so, I think that's given, you know, that buyer a lot of confidence and a lot of flexibility to go out and make the future investment that they want to make further for the retirement home and that's benefiting that Del Webb business for us.\nAlex Barron: Okay, great. And sorry if I missed it, but did you guys give, sort of a breakdown of, you know, price increase per segment, per buyer segment, which, you know, I'd like to know which ones are doing \u2013 which one is doing the best right now?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, we did that, but we can. So, first time entry level was up 2%, year-over-year, move up was up. 4%, we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, active adult was up 6%. You know, it's interesting, because, you know, there's a lot of movement under the hood on that, right, you know, in terms of geographic closings. So, mix matters. You know, what I would tell you is, the pricing environment is pretty strong. And, yeah, so, you know, underneath that, you know, where the closings came from the size of the product is important. So, but the headline numbers are two, four, and six for entry level move up and active adult.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Great, thank you, Sarah. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We will certainly be available over the course of day for any other questions, and we look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks Jim, and good morning. As detailed in this morning's release, our financial results show exceptional first quarter performance for PulteGroup. From double-digit growth in signups, revenues, and earnings to enhanced liquidity and a $1 billion expansion of our share repurchase authorization we posted a tremendous start to 2021. Beyond company specific gains, our first quarter results reflect the ongoing strength of homebuying demand throughout all segments of our business. It is worth highlighting that I believe the strength of the market is due in part to a significant housing shortage in this country. That shortage has been years in the making and will take years to correct. I think the first two sentences from a recent Wall Street Journal article aptly summarize the current state of housing supply in the U.S. The U.S. housing market is 3.8 million single family homes short of what is needed to meet the country's demand according to a new analysis by mortgage finance company Freddie Mac. The estimate represents a 52% rise in the nation's home shortage, compared with 2018, the first time Freddie Mac quantified the shortfall. Beyond this long-term structural shortage, COVID-19 has also resulted in a growing desire for single family living and has changed what homebuyers want and need from their homes. We believe these new wants and needs are often best met through the floor plans and features available on new construction. Add these dynamics do supportive demographics, low interest rates, and an improving economy, and you get the tremendous demand environment we're experiencing today. The strength in demand is reflected in our strong order growth for the quarter. In total, our net new orders were up 31% over the last year, while our absorption pace was up 37%. On a unit basis, this was the highest [first quarter finance], we've reported in over a decade and at $4.6 billion, our highest reported quarterly sales value ever. I would highlight that the strong demand we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 has continued into the first three plus weeks of April. We continue to see high traffic volumes in our communities and buyers anxious to purchase a new home. Working within the strong demand environment, we continue to improve our operating and financial performance. Our pricing strategies and disciplined business practices helped us to generate a gross margin of 25.5%, and an adjusted operating margin of 14.6% in the quarter. The resulting cash flows were then available to fund the future growth of our business and an increase in our ongoing return of excess capital to shareholders. At a very basic level, this is the model that we have been refining for the past decade. It starts with running a higher performing homebuilding operation, seeking to capture incremental gains in all areas of the business. It also includes investing in high quality projects and increasing our use of land purchase options to improve cash flows, and overall asset efficiency, while delivering consistently strong returns on investment and equity. Having built a home building operation that we believe can routinely generate strong returns and cash flows, we then allocate capital to support our long-term success and reward our shareholders. As we have highlighted many times, our highest priority is investing in our business through the acquisition and development of land assets that can generate required risk adjusted returns. To that end, since 2016, we have invested $14.6 billion in land acquisition and development and have done so while building a more efficient land pipeline. To clearly demonstrate the progress we have made, at the end of 2016, we own 99,000 watts, while controlling an additional 44,000 watts via option. Today, we actually own 5,000 fewer lots than five years ago and have more than doubled the lots we hold via option to 100,000. This significant and continuing change in the composition of our land pipeline has allowed us to increase the returns we generate while also helping us to reduce land related market risk. As you know, we've also made the return of funds to our shareholders an integral part of our capital allocation. Over the past five years, we've returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $154 million of stock repurchased in the first quarter. On that front, I am happy to note that this morning's announcement that our board approved an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization. And finally, as you saw in the first quarter, we were also prepared to allocate capital with a view towards further strengthening our balance sheet and reduce in our financial leverage. By paying down $726 million of debt in the quarter, including the successful tender for $300 million of our nearest dated outstanding debt, we were able to lower our debt-to-capital ratio on a gross basis to 23.3%. To be paying down debt and returning significant funds to shareholders, while targeting a 30% increase in our land acquisition and a development in 2021 says a lot about our expectations for the earnings power and the financial strength of this business. I think it also reflects a more return oriented shareholder friendly approach toward operating our business.  In fact, I think there is an ongoing maturation of the broader homebuilding industry in terms of its ability to generate higher returns with reduced risk. Given changes in the industry's operating and return profile, we believe investors can grow increasingly comfortable about investing in the sector over the entire housing cycle. With the opportunity for sustained high levels of housing demand, I believe PulteGroup's unique operating strategy has us well positioned to compete and to continue to grow our business. Beyond the financial strength that I discussed, I believe that our size and diversity provide important advantages. For example, a key driver to our order growth in the first quarter was the ongoing recovery in demand among active adult consumers. A year of being separated from their kids and grandkids has been more than enough for this buyer group. With vaccinations now moving into high gear, our active adult buyers are anxious to get on with their lives, including moving into a new Del Webb community. In conclusion, 2021 has gotten off to an excellent start for our company. With ongoing strong demand that exceeds available supply, a backlog value of $8.8 billion and our tremendous financial strength and flexibility, I am excited about what we can accomplish this year. Let me now turn the call over to Bob. Thanks Bob. Before opening the call to questions there are two final topics that I want to quickly review. First, as one of the nation's largest home building companies, we recognize and accept the important responsibilities we have to continue advancing sound ESG policies. In today's world success is judged not just by what we do, but also considers how we do. As such, along with actively working to improve how we operate, we're advancing our associated environmental, social, and governance reporting. To that end, along with all of our other accomplishments, in the first quarter, we launched a new section of our website called Pulte Cares. In addition to housing information on our efforts to run a sustainable business that supports the communities we serve, the site also contains our reporting against the sustainability accounting standards board's standards for our industry. This is the first year reporting against the SASB standards, and we look forward to showing our progress in future updates we'll be posting to the site. Finally, I would like to give a big shout out to the entire PulteGroup family for being ranked on the Fortune 100 list of Best Companies to work for. Since the founding of our company, we have viewed our culture as a critical and competitive advantage. The Fortune 100 list is built on an analysis conducted by the great place to work organization, which is based on employee surveys from thousands of companies. In our case, they surveyed 100% of our employees. To make the Fortune 100 list is an accomplishment, but to make it for the first time when we are operating in a global pandemic is clear and resounding statement about our people and the culture they have built inside of our organization. I truly could not be prouder of our company and specifically of our field leaders who do so much to support our people, and help them to be engaged, especially during these challenging times. My heartfelt thanks to all of you. Let me turn the call back to Jim. Thanks for the question, Mike. And just to clarify your question about buyer profile is specific to the active adult consumer or about all consumers? Yeah, really no change, Mike, in the makeup of that buyer group, the places they're coming from, and the things that they're asking for, I think largely remain the same as what we've experienced over the last, you know, four to five years. Yeah, Alan, good morning. It's Ryan, I appreciate the question. We are proud of the quarter and we're very excited about how the balance of the years is shaping up. We've been working hard on the production environment for the last, you know, two to three quarters, as we always do. But you know, certainly in this period of time, when we've got unprecedented demand, the production machine becomes more important than ever. We do believe that the size of our business, the way we run our business, the relationships that we've nurtured and fostered with our trade partners over the years are really paying dividends for us. And that's the, you know, Alan, that's the primary driver. This led us to, you know, the point where we can make the 25% plus increase in production in Q2, you know, moving to Q1 rather, and then moving to almost 10,000 units in Q2. So, we're very pleased with how the production machine is moving. It's not without its challenges, and Bob's highlighted some of those on the cost front. We're certainly seeing some challenges, you know, with certain commodities, windows, appliances, a few things like that. But, you know our procurement team has done just an outstanding job in managing some of those minor speed bumps in the road You know, last part of your question Alan about cycle time, we are seeing in certain markets, you know, some incremental days being added to the overall cycle time because of some of those supply chain constraints, but we believe we've factored all of those into the guide that we've given for not only Q2 closings, but also, you know Q2 start rates. Yeah, Alan, we're certainly concerned about the cost increases and that, you know, I think Bob's answer to the prior question highlighted that, you know, we've \u2013 it's part of the reason that we've moved our guide in terms of expectations on cost increases up, because, you know, things are getting more expensive. We are in certain consumer groups, most notably, in the lower price points, we are waiting to sell those homes later, starting them with specs, and we're waiting to sell those as they get later into the production cycle. You know, it's really allowing us to do two things, we're getting kind of current day sales price, and we've got better understanding on the delivery timing, and you know, what the cost of those homes are? The other thing I would add, Alan, it was a question that was part of your first question, and that's around our start rate, and whether or not you know, we're ramping up for more deliveries, and it's really about our spec inventory. We've historically run around 25% to 30% of our total production volume of spec, you heard in Bob's prepared remarks that we're running at 12% today. And so part of the incremental start rate will be to rebuild that spec pipeline that we'd like to carry. Yeah, Mike, it's Ryan. Good morning. And where we typically see seasonality in Q2 is into the May and June part of Q2. April generally tends to be fairly in line with March. We've seen, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we've seen the first three weeks of April continue in a very strong fashion. So, you know, time will tell what kind of seasonal adjustment we see in May and June.  We're not giving any kind of a forecast on that. I think you've heard from us and a number of other builders that have recently reported that demand is really strong, and we've had to limit sales in nearly every community, either via lot release or price increases or in most cases, both.  So you know, we'll have to see how the, you know, the back two months of the quarter play out when you take into consideration unprecedented demand, along with, you know, what's been a historical or slightly seasonal fall off. But you know, all things, all other things being equal, Mike, the business environment right now, is incredibly strong for a number of reasons. And you know, it's a good time to be a homebuilder. Yeah, Mike, thanks for the question. You know, we haven't given any kind of a guide for forward, you know, periods beyond what we've done in 2021. You know, as your question about structural changes in the business, I think we have made some real structural businesses, structural changes in the way that we operate our business. We've talked a lot about those, and we talked a lot about them in this current, you know, in this current release.  You know, I would, you know, continue to reiterate and remind everybody that we are running a business that's focused on generating return. That's what we believe creates value for our shareholders. So while the gross margins are nice, and we're certainly enjoying a very rich margin right now, that's not the number one or the only thing that we focus on when we're managing land investment, when we're managing risk, when we're managing capital allocation in a way that allows us to not only grow our business, but to take that excess cash that's being generated by the business, and we're returning that to shareholders. And I think what you're getting out of that story, Mike is a, you know, a very attractive return on equity profile that, you know, we're proud of, and I think our shareholders are very happy to have. Yeah, Truman, it's a good question. One of the things that \u2013 and we just, we looked at, I looked at it yesterday that the traffic, foot traffic through the door of our doors of our Del Webb communities continues to be very strong through the first three weeks of April. So, you know, we're very pleased with that. We like the way that that brand is operating right now, you know, over the last kind of 5 years to 7 years, we've made some shifts in the way that we build those communities, the way that we monetize them, and the way that we create the lifestyle. And, you know, as I think most of you appreciate, the most important thing with our Del Webb brand is the lifestyle that we offer, the home is almost secondary. In this post COVID environment, I think what we're seeing is consumers really value the ability for outdoor lifestyle type activities and events that allow you to be connected with other people, but still maintain some level of, kind of social distance. And the web communities offer that and so, you know, we made reference to the fact that after a year of being kind of locked inside that fire group is ready to kind of get on with life and get on with retirement. And so, you know, we're happy with that. The other thing, you know, that I'd highlight Truman that's an important part of our story and our diversified consumer offering is, we've got a big move up business, and that move up business remains very strong. And so that, you know, typically what happens is that active adult buyer, when they're selling their home, it's going to a move up buyer, which allows them to go do a lot of things and gives them great flexibility moving into the Del Webb community. So, you know, the tight supply environment on the resale side of the business, I think is a very good forward indicator of how strong the Del Webb business continue to be. Yeah, Truman so, you know, we've got, we're down to about six, five or six of those really large battleship Del Webb communities. There's a good land pipeline in all of those communities, and we are seeing very high absorption rates out of those legacy communities. You know, we've said, for a long time that, you know, if the market came back in such a way we could let the volume in those communities run a little more wide open given the land runway, and we're certainly doing that right now. It's a smaller percentage of the overall business. So, you know, while it moves, the needle is not going to move the needle as much as maybe what it once would have. Yeah. So Steven, we're very pleased with the ICG acquisition. We highlighted that, you know, on our Q1 or our Q4 call last quarter. You know, it highlights that the, you know, the business that we bought really only impacts our Jacksonville kind of North Florida business. And so, it's pretty small in terms of the overall impact of the company, but it has had a meaningful impact on our Jacksonville business. And so, we like kind of the fruits of what, you know, the fruits that we're getting off of that tree, I think are, you know, really good. And it's part of the reason that we're excited about, you know, getting close to announcing the location of the second plant. We've got, you know, we're down to, kind of a final couple of sites that will be the location for that. And you know, in short order, we'll be able to make a bigger announcement on that. And it's all part of, kind of the vision and the strategy that we had for ICG. And how do we see that playing out for our business over the next, you know, six to eight years, and we think there's a lot of benefits that will be generated for this company based on that platform. Yeah, Matt, good morning. I appreciate the comment. And really, you know, what we believe has happened, and so what we know has happened inside of our own company, and what we believe has happened inside of the industry is there is a better balance of risk that's being taken onto the company's balance sheet. And most notably, a more disciplined approach to capital allocation. If you go back a decade, 15 years in this industry, you know, it was very boom and bust all of the free cash flow in an upcycle was put into land. And then that land was harvested over the, you know, the following years. And sometimes you got caught in a cycle with the capital allocation philosophy that you're seeing from Pulte, and I think you're seeing elements of it from the entire industry. There's less owned land on the balance sheet, there's more options, there's more free cash being generated. Dividends are being paid, there is share repurchase programs in place, there's less debt. All of those things, I think warrant a, you know, a much different, kind of look from the investment community that I think how the industry has historically been viewed. Yeah, Carl. Good morning. Good to good to hear from you this morning. Certainly the increase in the business that we have guided to for 2021 has, you know, given us the opportunity to close out of some communities a little earlier than we expected. If you went back to the guide that we had previously given, we had indicated that our community count guide was going to be down in the 5% range. We'd update that today to suggest that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, this quarter this year versus the same quarter last year, our expectation is that we'll be down 5% to 10% for the balance of the year. So, for the second, third, and fourth quarter that would be our guide. We have not given any kind of indications on 2022 at this point. ...influencing the margin. Yeah, good morning. I think I understand most of the question. And you know, the makeup of our communities are largely the same over the last three or so years other than our big Del Webb communities. Our average community count size is about 130 lots. So, we don't have you know, other than a few of the legacy large Del Webb communities, we don't have, you know massive communities where you can really choose the absorption rate. And then, you know, in terms of community count, the only other part of the question that I would offer there is that, you know we have been very aggressive in the amount of incremental land spend that we're putting into the business, as we, you know, rebuild the land pipeline for 2022 and beyond. The only other thing that, you know is probably worth highlighting in terms of absorption paces is the mix shift of our business into entry level. And Bob highlighted on the prior question that we are seeing some of a shift from move up into entry level. And you'll recall, you know, going back three to four years, four years now, 4.5 years when I came into the chair as CEO, we talked about shifting some of our move up business into entry level. We've done that, and as you see that coming through on the closing side, those entry level communities typically come with higher per community absorption paces. Yeah. [Mike], the miss that we had relative to our guide was largely driven by the weather in Texas. It was unlike any winter storm that Texas has seen and it shut that operation down for the better part of two weeks. And so, you know, our expectation is, we'll work to get the majority of that back in the second quarter, John, and, you know, we think other than that the, you know, the production machine, as I'd indicated in one of the earlier questions, is running quite well. And we'd like the rate of upstarts that we're seeing out of the business. Yeah, Alex, it's Ryan, thanks for the question. We're really excited about what we're seeing out of the active adult performance. You know, I think anecdotally we're saying that we're seeing that buyer, you know, reemerge in all aspects of their life because of their confidence around the vaccine. So, I think that's certainly a positive. I highlighted, you know, a few questions ago that the strength of the move up market is, we think also really helping that business because it's very easy for that active adult buyer to sell their home right now. They're selling it at very high prices. And so, I think that's given, you know, that buyer a lot of confidence and a lot of flexibility to go out and make the future investment that they want to make further for the retirement home and that's benefiting that Del Webb business for us."

            "content": "Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Jumping right into our operating results, home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 17% over last year to $2.6 billion. The higher revenues for the period reflect the 12% increase in closings to 6,044 homes, coupled with a 4% increase in average sales price to $430,000. While home closings for the period were up more than 12% over last year, deliveries came in slightly below our guidance with the shortfall resulting primarily from the severe weather in Texas. 4% or $17,000 increase in average sales price realized in the quarter benefited for price increases across all buyer groups and was led by a 6% increase in ASP for our active adult closings. The buyer mix of closings in the first quarter is comparable with the prior year and included 33% from first time buyers, 43% from move up buyers, and 24% from active adult buyers. As Ryan mentioned, our net new orders in the first quarter were up 31% over last year to 9,852 homes. We experienced strong demand across all geographies and buyer groups with notable ongoing strength among our active adult buyers. In the first quarter, orders among our first time buyers increased 39% to 3,303 homes, while move up orders gained 18% to 4,040 homes and active adult voters increased a robust 49% to 2,509 homes. 49% year-over-year increase in active adult closings reflects the impact of the slowdown in sales in the last two weeks of March last year. But I would highlight that the 2,500 active adult orders this year represent a first quarter high dating back almost 15 years. I would also point out the buyer demand was consistently strong during each month of the quarter even when interest rates increased during the period. The 31% increase in orders could have been higher, but our divisions continued to actively manage sales in the quarter to match production rates and to help maximize project specific returns. Along with raising prices and a 100% of our communities to help cover cost inflation and moderate sales, all of our divisions used [flat releases] to more directly manage sales in some or all of their communities. For the first quarter, we operated from an average of 837 communities, which is down 4% from last year's average of 873 communities. The year-over-year decline in community count is consistent with our prior comments and reflects the impact of our decision to slow land spend when the pandemic first hit in March of last year along with the accelerated closeout of communities resulting from the ongoing elevated pace of sales. Consistent with the overall strength of the market, our cancellation rate in the quarter declined by more than 500 basis points from last year to just 8%, and we ended the quarter with a backlog of 18,966 homes, which is an increase of 50% over last year. On $1 basis, our backlog increased 58% to $8.8 billion. On a year-over-year basis, we increased the number of homes we started in the quarter by 25% to 8,364 homes, which helped to raise our total homes under construction by 22% to 14,728 homes. Of these homes, 1,798 or 12% were spec units, which on a percentage basis is down slightly from the fourth quarter of last year. Given market conditions, we have continued to work with our trade partners to further increase productions and expect to increase overall starts to at least 10,000 homes in the second quarter of this year. This would be an increase of at least 20% over the first quarter of this year. Based on the stage of construction for the 14,728 homes currently under construction, we expect deliveries in the second quarter to be in the range of 7,400 to 7,700 homes. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 27% in deliveries over the second quarter of last year.  Based on the ongoing strength of buyer demand and with almost 19,000 houses in backlog, we are raising our guidance for full-year closings to 32,000 homes. This is an increase of 7% from our prior guide of 30,000 homes and represents a 30% increase in deliveries for the year versus the prior year. The strong pricing environment has helped to lift the average sales price in our backlog by 5% over last year to $465,000. Given the backlog ASP and the anticipated mix of deliveries, we expect our average closing price in the second quarter to be in the range of $440,000 to $445,000. For the full-year, we now expect our average closing price to be between $450,000 and $455,000. Our homebuilding gross margin for the first quarter was 25.5%, which is an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year, and a sequential gain of 50 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase in gross margins, which exceeded our prior guidance, benefited from the exceptionally strong pricing environment for sold and spec homes, and for the mix of homes close to the period. In addition to the 4% increase in year-over-year ASP, our gross margins also benefited from lower sales discounts of 2.5% in the quarter, which represents a decrease of 110 basis points for the same period last year, and a decrease of 50 basis points for the fourth quarter of last year. As has been well reported, material and labor costs continue to move higher being led by lumber prices, which now seem to reach new highs every day. While we now expect our house costs, excluding land to be up 6% to 8% for the year, the strong demand environment is allowing us to pass through these costs in the form of both higher base sales prices, and lower discounts. Given these cost price dynamics, we expect gross margins to move higher throughout the remainder of 2021. As a result, we expect to realize sequential gains of approximately 50 basis points in each of the three remaining quarters this year, which would have us in the range of 27% for the fourth quarter of 2021. In the first quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues. Excluding the 10 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million, or 10.9% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense for the quarter of $264 million, or 11.9% of home sale revenues. We are adding people to handle our higher construction volumes, but we still expect to realize sequential overhead leverage with the second quarter SG&A expense in the range of 9.9% to 10.3%.  And for the full-year, we now expect adjusted SG&A as a percent of homebuilding revenue to be approximately 9.8%. As Jim noted, we did record a $61 million pre-tax charge in the period relating to the cash tender offer for 300 million of our senior notes that we completed in the first quarter. Turning to Pulte Financial Services, they continue to report outstanding financial results with pre-tax income more than tripling to $66 million, which compares to $20 million in the first quarter of last year. The large increase in pre-tax income reflects favorable competitive dynamics in the market, as well as higher loan production volumes resulting from the growth in our closings, and a 150 basis point increase in capture rate to 88%. Tax expense for the first quarter was $90 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than our recent guidance, primarily due to benefits related to equity compensation recorded in the period. We continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5% for the balance of the year, including the benefit of energy tax credits we expect to realize this year. In total, for the quarter, we reported net income of $304 million or $1.13 per share. Our adjusted net income for the period was $343 million or $1.28 per share. In the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net income of $204 million or $0.74 per share, and adjusted net income of $219 million or $0.80 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 23.3%, down from 29.5% at the end of the year as we use available cash to pay down $726 million of senior notes in the first quarter.  Our net debt to capital ratio was 5.5% at the end of the quarter. Along with paying down debt during the quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million common shares at a cost of $154 million for an average price of $46.11 per share. As Ryan mentioned, given the strength of our business and expectations for continued strong cash flows, and with our existing repurchase authorization down to approximately $200 million at the end of the quarter, the Board of Directors approved an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization. The return of excess capital to our shareholders remains a priority and as such, we expect to remain a consistent and systematic buyer of our shares. In the first quarter we invested $795 million in land acquisition and development, including the lots we put under control through these investments, we ended the first quarter with approximately 194,000 lots under control, of which 94,000 were owned and 100,000 were controlled through options. With 51% of our lots now controlled via option, we have surpassed our initial target of 50% owned and 50% optioned, and expected that the percentage of option lot can move even higher. Consistent with our outstanding financial results, I'm pleased to report that earlier this month, Standard & Poor's upgraded PulteGroup's debt to investment grade. This means that our senior notes are now rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. It's been a long process, but I'm extremely proud of the improvements we've been able to achieve in our credit metrics. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yeah, Mike, just to clarify, you know, if you add the sequential 50 basis points per quarter that would get us to around 27, not north of 27, in terms of the margin. And certainly what we have seen is an acceleration in cost lumber being the primary driver of that. I think everybody is well aware, it's at all time highs. You know, we're hopeful that supply will come to that market, and that pricing will wane somewhat.  You know, we've been waiting for that and haven't seen it yet. But, you know, we have updated our guide in terms of what the inflationary aspect of the sticks and bricks is, you know we've been at or near 5%, 6%, we're now at 6% to 8%. And depending on what lumber does, that could move a little bit even higher than that.  Having said that, you know, we've got a really strong pricing environment right now. It's accelerated through the year. And so as we look at the production and our build out for the year, we see being able to cover those cost increases, enough, obviously, to lead to that 50 basis point, kind of sequential movement in margin through the year. Alright. So to the first of your two questions. Steven, you know, did we do a stress test? I'm not sure what a stress test is on your backlog. We are always working with our backlog, though. You know, we actively manage them through the build cycle. And I would tell you that there are many things that can and might happen in a rising rate environment, and we would work with those consumers. You know, there are different products that can be offered. So yeah, I would agree that the strength of our backlog with 750 FICO scores, rising interest rates like that would not put our buyers in jeopardy. To your question on peak margins, you know there's so much that goes into that. What's the demand environment? What's the land environment? What type of product are we building? Having said that, I think your points are valid, whether they support higher margins or not structurally over time, I think they benefit the business. So, you mentioned virtual tours or selling costs. Yes, that's an enhancement interest. Certainly, we will get a benefit through time. You know, the $726 million that we paid down this quarter is $34 million in interest cost, which will ultimately come through as lower cost of sales. It'll take a little while because we capitalize it. So, there are a number of things that will benefit us through time. But they will be determinants of our margin, but so will the land cost, so will the vertical construction costs, and so will our selling prices. So to Ryan's earlier comment, you know, we underwrite against return, you guys have heard that from us a bunch. We obviously seek to maximize the margin that we are able to achieve. And we've got some tailwinds, but we've got some headwinds too in the form of lumber, etcetera. So, you know, Ryan said, it's a good time during the homebuilding business, it is. You know, we're enjoying very good margins. And we see them expanding through the year. So, I think that's a real positive. You know, candidly that's not a big determinant in our forward guide, because there is very little of it. I mean, at 8% that is as low a cancellation rate and I can recall in 10 years in the business, you know, it's down sizably from last year, and even for those recent sequential quarter. And I think what it shows is the strength of the market, people who are under contract want to close because they know how hard it is to find something else to buy if they weren't to buy from us. But to your point, yes, if somebody fell out of contract, you know, halfway through the process with us, at least today, we would be able to sell it for more than we had sold it to them for, but that's not a big driver of our margin guide at all. No real difference in the cycle time. And in terms of the mix shift, you know, what we'll actually see is more of a mix shift and it's modest from move up to first time, an entry level. And so you know, active adult will be pretty consistent year-over-year and for the balance of this year. So, it's really that mix shift to the first time that's ... Yeah. We haven't given any guide on our expectations for pricing next year, you know, what I would share is that currently we're sitting at a guide of 6% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. We've, for the last three to four years prior to 2021, we were in the 1% to 2% year-over-year increase range. So, you know, we've seen unprecedented increases in cost. You know, my hope would be that, but that would start to temper. Certainly a big driver of this year's increases is lumber, and we're at kind of unprecedented highs for lumber. You know, our analysis suggest that there's plenty of raw material. The constraint really seems to be on the sawmills, and we are seeing some additional capacity start to come online. So, you know, if we can see, you know, some moderation in the lumber market. And the industry can kind of continue to run at pretty efficient levels that we're at today. My hope would be that, you know, we could see some pullback and overall cost increases next year, relative to where we've been sitting this year. Yeah, well, [cement] very local, right, because the distribution ranges is pretty tight. And yes, where you've got markets where you've got activity, you're going to see pricing, and that's very consistent with what we typically see. You know, in terms of the labor market, you know, certainly it is a busy market out there. People have choices on where to work. Ryan mentioned earlier, the call, you know, we've obviously stepped up our production. You know, we've got good relationships with our trades, but it costs money to make people come to our job site today. And so that's built into that increase to the 6% to 8%. I wouldn't characterize it as hateful at the moment. You know, there is, you know, there is capacity out there. For some of the trades you have to pay to get them on the jobsite, though. But those are the, you know, as always, lumber and labor are going to be the two primary drivers of cost for us. Yeah, we did that, but we can. So, first time entry level was up 2%, year-over-year, move up was up. 4%, we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, active adult was up 6%. You know, it's interesting, because, you know, there's a lot of movement under the hood on that, right, you know, in terms of geographic closings. So, mix matters. You know, what I would tell you is, the pricing environment is pretty strong. And, yeah, so, you know, underneath that, you know, where the closings came from the size of the product is important. So, but the headline numbers are two, four, and six for entry level move up and active adult."

Q4 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for your patience. Mr. Jim Zeumer, you may begin the conference.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Good morning, Devin. Good morning and thank you, Devin. Look forward to discussing PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter earnings for the period ended December 31, 2022. I\u2019m Joined on today's call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate Website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. Please note, that consistent with this morning's earnings release, we will be discussing our reported fourth quarter numbers as well as our financial results adjusted to exclude the benefit of certain insurance reserve adjustments and JV income as well as the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition spend and a tax charge recorded in the period. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. And finally, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We ended 2022 on a high note as we closed almost 8,900 homes and delivered all-time fourth quarter records with homebuilding revenues of $5.1 billion and earnings of $3.85 per share. These results, in turn, helped PulteGroup finish the year with over $1 billion in cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below10%. Bob will detail the rest of our Q4 results in a few minutes. Driven by the company's exceptional fourth quarter performance, PulteGroup delivered another year of great financial results. For 2022, our home sale revenues increased 18% over the prior year to $15.8 billion, our reported pre-tax earnings increased by 37% to $3.4 billion and our reported earnings increased 48% to $11.01 per share. These results provided us the flexibility to invest $4.5 billion into the business, while returning over$1.2 billion to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases. Let me just pause right here and thank our entire organization for their efforts in delivering such a great operating and financial results under some challenging market conditions. We are truly fortunate to have such an outstanding team. In assessing our 2022 financial results, we fully appreciate that gains in volume, pricing, gross margin and earnings reflect the stronger demand environment that existed earlier in 2022. As we all know, the Federal Reserve decision to hike rate 7x in 2022 and its fight against inflation is successfully slowing the economy, including housing. For the full year, national new and existing home sales across the country fell 16% and 18%, respectively from 2021. Consistent with the trend of these national numbers, our 2022 net new orders were down roughly 27% from 2021. The softer demand we've experienced as a result of consumers priced out of the market by higher prices and higher mortgage rates, along with those individuals who have moved to the sidelines given market uncertainties and risks. Despite the higher rate environment dominating the national conversation, we saw buyer demand improve as the fourth quarter progressed and can confirm this strength continued through the month of January. We will have to see how things progress from here, but I think this improvement attests to the ongoing desire for homeownership that exists in this country. Net signups both in absolute number and absorption pace increased as we move through each month of the fourth quarter and through the month of January. While seasonal trends have been distorted over the past few years, monthly sales moving higher as the fourth quarter progressed is atypical. In short, we're encouraged by the recent improvement in our new home sales. Based on feedback from our sales offices, buyers have been responding to the decline in mortgage rates. Consistent with this idea, I would add that rate buydowns remain among the top incentives for our customers. Along with the decline in mortgage rates, actions we've taken to help improve overall affordability appear to be gaining traction. In alignment with our strategy to find price and turn our assets, we continue to implement programs that enable consumers to buy homes in today's higher rate environment. The cost of these programs which might include rate buydowns, lower lot premiums, or even price reductions can be seen in our higher Q4 incentives. In the fourth quarter, incentives increased to 4.3% of sales price. On a sequential basis, this is up from 2.2% on closings in the third quarter of 2022. Beyond just adjusting incentives in many of our active communities, we have already introduced smaller floor plans to help lower future prices and associated costs. The introduction of smaller floor plans is just part of a comprehensive effort to lower overall construction costs to help offset the pressure on sales price. The obvious question now is will this strengthening of demand continue? Like all of us on this call, I've heard strong arguments on both sides. But the honest answer is that no one really knows. Home Builders are optimist by nature. And I want to believe that the Fed can orchestrate a soft landing, but the risk of a recession is real. We're currently seeing buyers respond to lower rates, and better pricing. But what happens is fed actions weaken the employment picture is uncertain. With today's volatile market dynamics, one of our frequent conversations with investors is around how Pulte plans to operate its business over the near-term. Given the long timelines associated with land development and home construction, we need to set a plan, but be prepared to adjust as market dynamics require. At a high-level, I'd like to share how we plan to operate the business for the foreseeable future. At our core, we remain a build order builder, but our system operates best with a steady volume of production. As such, our plan for the -- our plan is for a consistent cadence of new starts. This would include starting spec homes on a pace consistent with spec sales. We've shared on prior calls that in the current environment, buyers are showing a preference for homes that have near-term delivery dates. As an example, in the fourth quarter, spec sales represented over 60% of our new orders. Our recent sales show that we are finding the market clearing price using our strategic pricing tools to set price and incentives. Within today's sales environment, we will be intelligent about the process as we optimize our production machine and turn through our land assets. As always, our primary focus will be to deliver strong relative returns on invested capital through the cycle. In planning for 2023, we have assumed our current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the reality for the next several months. Combining our planned starts, with our 18,000 homes currently in production, we expect to have a production universe that will allow us to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023. We have goals in place to reduce cycle time, and our procurement and construction teams are already realizing success in cutting production days, but a lot of work remains to be done. Buyer demand will ultimately determine what the coming year looks like, but this is our operating plan. We see this as a prudent, balanced approach that checks key strategic boxes, namely; we maintain a level of production in our communities, which is critical when negotiating with local trades and suppliers. We keep an appropriate level of specs in production while seeking to control finished inventory, and we continue to turn our assets, generate cash and position the business for the next leg of the housing cycle. Given today's market dynamics, at this time, we will be providing guidance for our first quarter, but not the full year. In sharing our operational approach for 2023, we have hopefully conveyed a thoughtful process and conceptualize the opportunity we see for our business. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup completed the year by delivering a strong fourth quarter results, the benefits of which can be seen throughout our financial statements. In my analysis of the company's operating and financial performance, I will review our reported numbers as well as our financials adjusted for the specific items Jim noted at the start of this call. PulteGroup's fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 20% over last year to $5.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 8,848 homes in combination with a 17% increase in average sales price to $571,000. The increase in average sales price in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains in pricing across all buyer groups. Our closings for the quarter came in above our Q4 guide as we benefited from higher spec sales that closed in the quarter and a faster-than-anticipated recovery in our Florida operations following the impact of Hurricane Ian. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter was 36% first-time buyers, 39% move-up buyers and 25% active adult. This compares with last year's closings, which were comprised of 33% first time, 42% move-up and 25% active adult. The increase in first-time closings is consistent with changes in our mix of communities and the greater availability of spec homes in our first-time buyer neighborhoods. Our spec strategy emphasizes production within our Centex brand as almost 60% of spec units are in communities targeting first-time buyers. In the quarter, we recorded net new orders of 3,964 homes, which is a decrease of 41% from the same period last year. The decline in orders for the period reflects the ongoing softness in buyer demand caused by the significant increase in interest rates realized in '22 in combination with higher cancellations experienced in the period. As a percentage of sign-ups, the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was 32% compared with 11% last year. Cancellations as a percentage of backlog at the beginning of the quarter totaled 11% in the fourth quarter this year compared with 4% in the fourth quarter last year. I would note that in the 4 years prior to the pandemic, quarterly cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog averaged 10%, so Q4 cancellations in relation to backlog were in line with historic norms. In the fourth quarter, our average community count was 850, which is up 8% from an average of 785 last year. Community count growth reflects new community openings as well as the slower closeout of certain neighborhoods. Based on planned community openings and closings, we expect our average community count in the first quarter of '23 to be flat sequentially or approximately 850 communities. For the remainder of '23, we expect quarterly community count to be up 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. By buyer group, fourth quarter orders to first-time buyers decreased 28% to 1,574, while move-up demand was lower by 56% to 1,241 homes and active adult declined 36% to 1,149 homes. As has been widely discussed, housing demand remains under pressure as higher interest rates and years of price appreciation have stretched affordability for buyers. We ended the quarter with a backlog of 12,169 homes with a value of $7.7 billion. This compares to the prior year backlog of 18,003 homes with a value of $9.9 billion. As Ryan discussed, our objective is to keep turning -- keep inventory turning, which requires that we start an appropriate number of homes. In the fourth quarter, we started approximately 4,000 homes, which is down 50% from the fourth quarter of last year, and, on a sequential basis, down about 40% from the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with a total of 18,103 homes in production, of which 10% were finished. Of our total homes under construction, 43% were spec. This is slightly above our target of having specs comprised approximately 35% of our work in process, but given buyer preference for a quicker close, we are comfortable having a few more homes in production. Based on our production pipeline, we currently expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,700 homes in the first quarter of the year. As Ryan indicated, for the full year, we will have the production potential to close approximately 25,000 homes. These production numbers assume a continuation of current construction cycle times. Given the price of homes in backlog, the mix of homes we expect to close and the anticipated level of spec closings in Q1, we expect the average sales price for Q1 closings to be between $565,000 to $575,000. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 12% over the first quarter of '22. In the period, we reported gross margins of 28.8%, which remain near historic highs for the company. This represents an increase of 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period, although down sequentially from the 30.1% gross margin we delivered in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to deliver another strong quarter with Q1 gross margins of 27%, which includes the benefit of lower lumber costs due to the fall in lumber prices in the back half of '22. Any savings from ongoing renegotiation of labor and material contracts will be realized in future quarters, and we will have to see how much of this work benefits our '23 versus our '24 closings. Our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $351 million, or 6.9% of home sale revenues, includes a net pre-tax benefit of $65 million from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $415 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues. In Q4 of last year, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues included a net pre-tax benefit of $23million from insurance-related reserve adjustments [ph]. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. With the pullback in overall housing demand, we\u2019ve worked hard to ensure our overheads are properly aligned with today's tougher operating conditions. As such, we expect SG&A expense in Q1 to be in the range of 10.5%to 11% compared with 10.7% last year. In other words, even with lower closing volumes, we are in a position to realize overhead leverage that is comparable to '22. Reported fourth quarter pre-tax income from our financial services operations was $24 million, down from $55million last year. The decline in pre-tax income reflects both lower profitability per loan and an overall decrease in loan origination volumes as mortgage capture rate declined by 10 percentage points to 75%. In the fourth quarter, we walked away from 21,000 option lots and an associated $900 million in future land acquisition spend. As a result of these actions, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $31 million for the write-off of related pre-acquisition costs and deposits. This charge was offset by a pretax gain of $49 million in JV income associated with the sale of commercial property completed in the quarter. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $282 million, which represents an effective tax rate of24.2%. Our Q4 taxes included a $12 million charge associated with deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. We expect our tax rate in the first quarter and for the full year in '23 to be 25%. On the bottom line, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $882 million or $3.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company's net income was $832 million or $3.63 per share. These results compared with prior year reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share, and adjusted net income of $637 million or$2.51 per share. Moving past the income statement, we invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, with almost 65% of this spend for development of existing land assets. For the full year, we invested a total of $4.5 billion in land, including $1.9 billion of acquisition and $2.6 billion of development spend. Given recent decisions to exit certain option land positions, we ended the year with 211,000 lots under control, which is down 8% from last year and down 13% from the recent Q2 peak of 243,000 lots. With the decision to drop option lot deals over the past two quarters, owned lots currently represent 52% of lots under control. As we\u2019ve discussed on prior earnings calls, given the slowdown in overall housing activity, we plan to dramatically lower our land spend in 2023. At this time, we expect our total land investment to be approximately$3.3 billion, with an estimated 65% of these dollars going toward development of owned land positions. Along with investing in the business, we continue to allocate capital back to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares at a cost of $100 million for an average price of $41.81 per share. PulteGroup continues to maintain one of the most active share repurchase programs in the industry, having repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock in 2022, or almost 10% of our shares outstanding, for $1.1billion at an average cost of $44.48 per share. In 2022, we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. After allocating capital to the business and our shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio was 18.7%, which is down from 21.3% last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. For all the financial success that we realized in 2022, I can tell you it was a hard year to navigate. When the year started out, we had almost unlimited demand, but supply chain disruptions resulted in countless bottlenecks and extended build cycles. As the year progressed and rising interest rates push more and more consumers to the sidelines, we initiated a series of operational changes as we quickly adapted to the more competitive market conditions. If there is a silver lining in today's challenging demand environment, I think we have what can be viewed as favorable supply -- as a favorable supply dynamic. Recent figures from the National Association of Relators show the inventory of existing homes for sale at 970,000, or only 2.9 months of supply. Existing homes are our industry's biggest source of competition, so such limited supply is certainly advantageous. As we sit here today, I\u2019m incrementally more optimistic about the year ahead, but as the expression goes, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I think what we\u2019ve done -- well, I think that we\u2019ve done that in terms of how we've setup our business. We head into 2023 with enough units in production to meet demand and with production plans will allow us to continue turning assets. At the same time, we don't have an excess of spec homes in the system that will cause incremental self-inflicted pressures. We are in a strong competitive position within the markets that we serve. We are typically among the biggest builders in our markets, and our ability to serve all price points provides opportunities with land sellers and municipalities. And finally, we are in exceptional financial position with plenty of liquidity, no debt maturities for 3 years and expectations for another year of strong cash flow. There are opportunities to be seized upon even in challenging market conditions. When the time comes, PulteGroup will have the flexibility to take advantage of those opportunities. I will close by again thanking the entire PulteGroup organization for their work this past year to build outstanding homes and to provide an exceptional customer experience. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get through as many questions as possible during the time remaining. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Devin, if you will open it up for questions, we are all set.\nOperator: Our first question comes from John Lovallo with UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, can you just give us an idea of the margin on quick move-in homes compared to the company average?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. It's interesting. It depends, and I hate to give you the mix, but geographically, it makes a difference. Obviously, we are going to see stronger performance in markets where we are seeing stronger sales activity, I think the Southeast of Florida, specs out West are a little bit more challenged. So it really does matter where. On balance, we've seen -- interestingly, if you think about our Q4 guide for margins, we outperformed it. Part of that was that geographic mix. We've talked about getting more volume out of Florida which is one of our better margin performances, but also because of the relative strength of spec sales, we did a little bit better on those than we anticipated when we gave the guide.\nJohn Lovallo: Got you. Okay. And then it was the commentary on demand getting better through the quarter and into January was interesting and encouraging. Can you just give us an idea of how broad based that demand was? I mean, was it limited to certain markets? Or was it pretty much across your footprint?\nRyan Marshall: John, the improvement really came across the footprint on a relative basis. Speaking geographically, we continue to see strength in Florida and the Southeast. As Bob just highlighted in the last answer, we continue to see great performance out of the Texas markets. And probably one of the more encouraging signs that we've seen as we started to see our Western markets, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Southern California, Northern California, we started to see those markets come back to life. So kind of broad based improvement across the footprint.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, you have lower lumber costs beginning to flow through the P&L and perhaps some other stick and brick cost savings. We also have likely higher land costs and perhaps some uncertainty around pricing. I'm hoping you can help us think through first quarter gross margins. Do you think it will be likely the low point for the year given the kind of sequential improvement in demand that you've seen?\nRyan Marshall: Truman, I think you've highlighted the variables that are out there. And at this point in time, we've given a guide for Q1. And as I mentioned in my comments, that's the extent of kind of what we are going to provide at this point.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Got you. Understood on that. And how are tertiary submarkets within metros performing relative to closer end communities maybe in entry-level move-up segments? I'm thinking that the prior remote worker or work-from-home tailwinds might be leveling off here, which might negatively impact the tertiary markets, but at the same time, affordability is a bit squeezed and the tertiary markets provide a better value proposition.\nRyan Marshall: Well, Truman, I think, as we've talked about with our land acquisition strategy over the years, we've attempted to stay closer into the core, closer to the job market in some of the retail sectors. We certainly have a sizable first time entry-level buyer business and affordability there matters. So we do have communities that are more in the growth rings and on the -- in the tertiary areas, but I don't believe that our land footprint goes out quite as far as maybe some of our competitors. So what I'd tell you is it kind of depends on -- it's a community-by-community situation that is, as much as anything, from a margin standpoint, dependent on the structure of the land deal. And like, I think, you've heard from us in a lot of situations, we don't underwrite the gross margin, we really focus on underwriting to return. But going back to the question that John asked, we've seen relative strength and improvement in kind of sales across the board, that's not just geographically speaking, but that's community by community as well.\nTruman Patterson: Perfect. Thank you all for the time.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, Truman.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice execution, and thanks for the time here. Ryan, just on the margin, I know you're not guiding beyond 1Q, but I'm just curious if you could talk through a little bit. When I compare you guys to some of your larger competitors, your margins right now are outperforming by a pretty wide level 400, 500 basis points. And while I understand there might be a little bit of a lag there given they're maybe more spec focused than you are, it's still a little bit surprising to see the outperformance. So could you talk a little bit about my understanding you're not going to give guidance, is that just a timing issue? Or is there something you guys are doing that is resulting in that outperformance, in your opinion?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it, and I think, for those that have followed us for years, yourself in that category, I think everybody is aware that we've implemented a number of really important kind of changes in the way that we operate our business that has driven higher returns over the housing cycle, and certainly, higher margins have been part of that. Those initiatives have touched everything from the way that we design our homes and communities to how we price and sell homes. And a really big part of it is the quality of the dirt that we're buying. A little bit back to the question that Truman announced a minute ago. And the way that we have evaluated and underwritten risk and the associated requisite returns that we ask for as part of the risk associated with those communities. So I think you're seeing -- I think you're certainly seeing that pay off. We have highlighted on this call, in my prepared remarks, the way that we are going to run the business in this environment, which is a tougher operating environment. And we really feel it's important to turn our inventory to get good flow-through and to sell and define kind of a market clearing price. So while we believe that the operating model that we have is a great one, and we are really reaping the rewards from it, we won't be immune to some of the market pressures that are certainly out there. But we think that we are an efficient homebuilder, and we are going to continue to be very disciplined and prudent in the way that we are making pricing decisions.\nAlan Ratner: Great. I appreciate all the thoughts there. Second question on the cost side. I think, over the last few months, we've heard a lot of optimism from homebuilders about their ability to renegotiate costs lower, especially as starts have pulled back as much as they have and what was shaping up to be a pretty volume outlook in '23. And your comments are similar to what we've heard from others that the market seems to be showing some improvement here. I can't help but look at lumber costs up 40% year-to-date and imagining that perhaps that might be filtering through to some other inputs as well. So what's your current thinking on the cost side? Are you feeling a little bit less bullish about your ability to kind of push back on costs now given what seems to be a strengthening marketplace? Or do you still feel like you can find some relief there as the year goes on?\nRyan Marshall: Well, Alan, it's going to be tricky, and I will break down a couple of components that we are looking at on the cost side. We've talked a lot about affordability being the biggest challenge that we've had over the last several quarters. And I think affordability is going to continue to be the theme as we move through kind of 2023, not just in housing, but I think in all consumer spending, consumers are feeling the affordability pinch, and it's part of the reason that we've worked so hard to find prices that we believe help to address some of that affordability pinch. With that comes the cost side that you're appropriately highlighting. We have certainly seen and we've gotten very positive reception from our trade partners around the front end of the house as they've started to see a slowdown in new starts and kind of permits pulled. We've been collaborative in talking about what we're seeing and hearing from consumers. And they really -- they've worked to help reduce costs kind of as we've reduced our prices as well. We've seen a lot of progress with lumber. That's certainly a commodity and those things can kind of change. So we'll keep an eye on that. Probably the thing that I would tell you is going to be hardest on the cost side is the labor side of things. And that's the piece that I think will be sticky. Those wage increases have been real, and I think once those wage increases have been provided or given, they're hard to get back. Not impossible, but the material side -- not saying the material side will be easy, but I think we will likely have more success or easier success on the material side than we will labor. So time will tell as the year plays out. As I highlighted in some of my remarks, we've got some really aggressive goals that our procurement teams are working on to reduce overall costs.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Just if I could squeeze in one last one there. So on the lumber side, I just want to make sure I understand the timing of this. You mentioned that you're benefiting now on 1Q deliveries from the pullback we saw last year. Assuming this 40% increase kind of holds here or maybe even goes a little bit higher, when would that eventually be a headwind to your margins? Would that be kind of a second half of this year type impact?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes.\nAlan Ratner: Thank you, Bob. Appreciate it.\nRyan Marshall: Efficient, very efficient answer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nRyan Marshall: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Rehaut: I wanted to circle back to the gross margins in the fourth quarter and the first quarter guide. And as Alan referenced, you\u2019ve a significant gap positively in your favor, obviously relative to the rest of the industry at this point. And it's interesting that, obviously, one or two quarters doesn't make a trend, but when you look back in prior years, the historical gap of gross margins was in the 200 to 250 bps range, and now we are talking double that, if not more. I just wanted to make sure because I think it would be helpful for investors to kind of understand. If there isn't any type of kind of short-term actions or things within the mix or relative to what you have in backlog that if there's any reason that there's some unusual short-term items that are helping the gross margins. Because we all kind of remember the comments you made last quarter of not being margin proud, and you didn't have a significantly lower order growth number than we were looking for, but just wanted to understand kind of some of the puts and takes there, and if you're doing anything significantly different in the industry in the marketplace that might allow this larger gap to continue.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, I think I understand your question. Hopefully, you appreciate, when we provide commentary on our results, if there are unusual things happening, we tell you about them, whether it's in the form of an adjustment or when we present adjusted data. And to answer your question as directly as I can, there's nothing unusual happening in our margin in the fourth quarter. We are not projecting anything unusual to happen in our margin in the first quarter other than the homes that we are closing. I think if you reflect on the answer that Ryan gave, and I can't comment on the relativity to other people's margins, what they're doing pricing lines, what we're doing pricing wise. We can only comment on what we are doing, which is trying to run a thoughtful business, get to a point where we can offer affordability to the consumer where we can earn a return. So I don't know if that gets where you need to be, but there's nothing unusual happening in our margins.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, and let me maybe just pick up on the comment you made about the comment I made last quarter about not being margin proud, that's still 100% accurate. And we've tried to reflect that in the way I laid out, we are going to be operating our business, which is to find a market price that will allow us to maintain a predictable and consistent turn of our inventory. It's the way that we can keep this business running efficiently and deliver the high returns that Bob talked about. So while we are -- we would certainly endeavor to do much better from a comparable sales standpoint than what we had in the fourth quarter. I think relative to our peer set, you can see that we are selling homes. And we are going to continue to make sure that we are priced competitively with our market offerings.\nMichael Rehaut: Yes. No, I appreciate that. I mean, I guess, I was trying to get to something you don't want to give, which is second quarter guidance, and we understand that. But I think people would kind of think, okay, you have a significant positive gap here as there were [indiscernible] drop maybe in the backlog that might allow that gap to revert to normal, but it doesn't sound like that's the case. I guess secondly, the SG&A guidance was pretty encouraging as well given the decline in closings yet the midpoint being similar to a year ago. So just wanted to delve into that a little bit. If you could kind of talk about what you're doing on the cost side there in terms of either headcount or other cost management? And if we were to expect a similar type of percentage decline in the coming quarters, given what you've been able to do in the first quarter, is that something where we could see a similar SG&A in spite of a 5%, 10% or, let's say, 10%-ish decline in closings?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, hopefully, you can appreciate we -- on our most recent call, had highlighted we would be looking at our overheads to make sure that they are efficient given the scale of the business that we are operating today. We have taken actions on costs, and they are varied by market depending on how that particular market is performing. I think you can and should expect us to always do that, right? I mean we are always looking at it. Are we running an efficient business? As it relates to beyond the first quarter, like everything else, there's -- it's a volatile -- not a volatile, but it's a market in flux. We haven't provided a guide on that. But I can tell you, we will be looking at our overheads as part of -- as we see the business develop, we will develop our plans around overhead spend as well.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. Just one last quick one, if I could. It's actually kind of also in response to clarification on a prior sneaking question. When you talk about the lumber costs being up year-to-date and that impacting maybe the back half of the year, just wanted to get a sense from you. I mean, on a dollar basis, it's significantly lower than it -- the percentage is kind of obfuscates the dollar amount, which is somewhat lower on an absolute basis when you think about where lumber was. And secondly, I would presume there's also some amount of potential labor savings that might come through in the back half just given where the market has gone over the last 6 months and a 40% increase in lumber, all else equal sounds one way, but, to me, there's potential offsets to that. Just wanted to know what you thought if that makes to you?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So in real math, our lumber load was down about $10,000 in the deliveries. Q1 will have that benefit in it. That obviously impacts the margin guide that we gave. I think you heard Ryan say that labor is actually likely to be a little bit stickier so we don't really know if we're going to be able to drive those costs down. So -- and Ryan, I think, said it well. Lumber is a commodity. We typically have the pricing of the lumber impact our closings two quarters in the future, right, because when we order then build the house so the pricing we feel in the market, we feel in our income statement two or three quarters later. And that's true for most of our commodity pricing. And I would tell you, other than lumber, it's been an inflationary market, so we've seen pressure on pricing. Again, Ryan talked about labor being a little bit sticky. Obviously, we are working with our trades, and it's how we build, where we build, can we help them be more efficient in order to offer us a better price, and that's what our procurement teams are working on right now. And as we highlighted in the prepared commentary, that process, whatever it yields, will impact our margin profile likely late in '23 or even into early '24 by the time those price changes get negotiated and then start flowing into houses that would close with a 6-month build time, again, two, three quarters from now.\nMichael Rehaut: Perfect. Thank you so much \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. [Indiscernible] you mentioned, Ryan or Bob, the mix of deliveries 36% first time, 39% move up, 25 active adult. Is your expectation for '25 -- or '23 on that 25,000 unit guide to be much different than that mix or shift in any meaningful way?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: It's interesting, Carl. I don't know that meaningful, but certainly, you heard a couple of things hopefully from us. 60% of our sales have been spec. They are -- our spec inventory is largely in our first-time communities. Our community count, which was up 8% year-over-year, the preponderance of that is in first-time communities. The mix of our lots looking forward is a little bit richer towards first time. So I wouldn't call it a big shift. But yes, I would tell you that first-time has been -- even if you think about the sales paces in the quarter, the decline was the lowest in that first-time space. So that's where the activity is today.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. Thanks for confirming that, Bob. And then just on active adult, I'm curious how that business has trended. Has it been over the course of the last four months or so given that customer is more likely to pay cash, less worried about rates? We had a thin existing home sales environment, but the stock market has been tough. Could you just maybe chat a little bit about how that customer seems to be faring in an environment like this and contrast them with what you're seeing in the first time in the move-up market just attitudinally? Thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Carl, it's a great question. And as I think you're aware, we are really proud of our Delaware business and what it adds to kind of the overall mix of our portfolio. You highlighted that buyer tends to be probably most reactive, positive and negative, to volatility within the broader market. And there's certainly been a fair amount of kind of volatility lately. That tends to cause that buyer to maybe pause as opposed to stop. On the positive side, you highlighted it's a thin resale inventory market. And so I certainly think that buyer has been able to sell their home. They've been able to sell their home, but I think at pretty good price. And on the buy side, they're not necessarily looking for a mortgage or the mortgage they're looking for is pretty small. So there are some puts and takes. A couple of other things that I'd highlight, relative to the other two buyer groups that we serve, they were -- the active adult was in the middle. They weren't quite as strong as the first-time buyer. Again, I think because they don't have to move, they've got options, they can be a little more patient. They were certainly more strong -- or did better than the move-up buyer, I think, mostly driven by the fact that they're not as rate sensitive. So on balance, Carl, we feel pretty good about the active adult space, kind of all things considered. And I think it will continue to be a strong benefit to the overall enterprise.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nQ - Anthony Pettinari:  Good morning. Just following up on affordability, when we look at net order ASP, I guess, down 5% quarter-over-quarter, is it possible to break that out between incentives based price reductions and kind of any mix shift that you saw?\nRyan Marshall: Anthony, we haven't provided that, and so we're not going to reluctantly.\nQ - Anthony Pettinari: Yes. I mean, directionally, is there a way to think about mix shift as being significant or not significant? I don't know if there's any kind of parameters you can put there?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Anthony, I think what I would tell you is that it's fluid. And sometimes things that start as kind of discounts off of a price or adjustments to lot premiums, sometimes those are rolled into kind of base price changes or base price reductions. And so the discount gets embedded over time into kind of what the new market price is. So, to Bob's point, we are not going to probably break it out at this point. But you can see, based on the incentive load that I talked about as well as the kind of reduction of base price, we are finding what we think is the market-clearing price to continue to sell homes.\nQ - Anthony Pettinari: Okay, okay. Understood. And then just I think your selling homes on land that was partially or maybe even largely put under control prior to the pandemic. Just how long kind of roughly before you sort of exhaust that cost basis? And then can you just touch on impairment risk? I mean what kind of -- what level of margin or price pressure would you need to see before a community would come under review for impairment?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So in answer to the first question, I think we, on average, been buying 3 to 4 years of land. When you add in development time lines, land is going to be hanging around 4 -- in the neighborhood of 4 years. And so if you think of that, pre-pandemic land would be kind of working its way through the system now. In response to the impairment question, obviously, we do impairment reviews every quarter. We are coming from a pretty strong margin position, but we always look and, for instance, in this most recent quarter, we actually looked at 16communities for impairments and impaired 4 of them for about -- it was about $2 million in costs that flow through the quarter, the other 12 did not. And so I think, absent some real structural shift in the market, I wouldn't anticipate a widespread kind of remark of our book. I think you will continue to see us as we look at this, evaluate communities one by one. And depending on the market conditions for that community, if we are in a position like we were with these four communities in the quarter, we'll adjust.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, Bob, appreciate the color so far. A couple of follow-ups here. In terms of the incentives, I think -- and maybe I'm mistaken, but I think the incentives, given we are on closings, the increase to 4%. Can you just help us understand, you talked about the improvement in demand, but also making further adjustments on price incentives. What's your current incentive load on orders, if you can give us that?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, Mike, we haven't. And to the comment that Ryan just made, I think he said it well. Pricing is dynamic in the market, right? And so if you adjust base pricing, it doesn't show as an incentive, it's just a lower sales price. And so on a relative basis, over time, we are in a position where we haven't given a guide on margin. We have given you what the incentive load went to, which was 4.3%, which is almost double, but there were price changes embedded in that, too, right? So all those things factor in, so the guide we've given for Q1 margin reflects everything that we've done to this point, and I think we will leave it there.\nMike Dahl: Got it. And then in terms of the improvement through the quarter, I appreciate, like to get into the specifics here, but since you gave the commentary about orders progressing through the quarter in January, can you just enlighten us on a year-on-year basis? Where did you -- where have you stood month-to-date in January? Help us understand the magnitude of improvement versus what you saw through the fourth quarter?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, we don't -- we've never kind of given that type of kind of inter-quarter trajectory. So we are going to leave it probably where we're at, which is we are optimistic and encouraged, not only based on what we saw things kind of progressed through the fourth quarter, which, as I mentioned, is pretty atypical to see the fourth quarter build strength, but we've certainly seen that strength also continue into January. So cautiously optimistic and rates in that period have certainly been lower. So we think that has contributed. We will see kind of what the Fed does here in the next meeting. But all things considered, the operating environment, which we've -- I think we've talked at [indiscernible] is going to be more difficult. We are pretty pleased with what we are seeing in the sales for [ph].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Encouraging stuff regarding your comments on the market, and that certainly aligns with what we're hearing as well. I wanted to follow-up on your comment about rates being a major driver to the improvement that you've been seeing. At this point, what share of would you say prospective buyers that you're seeing are having their mortgage application rejected? So you're actually not seeing them able to qualify compared with, let's say, what you would have seen in 2019. And when you think longer term about your business, I think you said 25,000 starts or something like that. How much of that production do you expect to be used for rental purposes relative to, again, a normal time, let's say, 2019.\nRyan Marshall: So, Stephen, let me grab the first piece of that. I will let Bob take the mortgage side. I would tell you rate -- the first, your comment on rate, rate is part of it. What's really driving kind of the sales trajectory right now is affordability, and rate is part of that equation. We've also done things in the way we've repriced, the way we've created incentive loans that have helped so affordability as well. So I think that's a big part of it. I will skip to a couple of things that you said about production. Just to clarify so everybody is on the same page, we've got enough production based on what was already in production, plus what we intend to start that will deliver in this year such that our universe -- our production universe will be big enough such that we'd expect to have enough homes to close, approximately 25,000 homes. So -- and then from a rental -- your rental question, we've targeted -- if you go back to the announcement we made a few years ago that we want to do -- have roughly 7,500 homes over a 5-year period, kind of works out to be about 1,500 homes a year once we get fully kind of ramped up. So fairly small piece of our business, which is kind of how we strategically designed that. And I'll flip it to Bob, and he can talk about the mortgage piece.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. I guess the good news is, Stephen, we haven't seen a change really in people's ability to qualify, or we haven't seen people not being able to qualify increasing in a disproportionate way because of the rising rates. And I think more often than not, people know what they can spend. They're prequalifying as they go through the process. So over the -- I won't say that I know that versus 2019, but if you look back over the last year or 2 we have seen a pretty consistent cadence of the percentage of people that are canceling contracts because they can't qualify. It has not moved materially with the change in rates.\nStephen Kim: Yes. That's really -- that's interesting and encouraging. I guess, Ryan, you just mentioned you sort of were more specific about your comment about that 25,000 unit mark, and that's helpful. And what I gathered from your comment is that you may actually start fewer than 25,000, correct me if I'm wrong, and so you're addressing sort of your ability to sort of scale down your starts as you have because you actually, I think, peaked at like 35,000 starts in 2021, I think it was. And so I guess my question regarding how you're thinking about the size of your business when things sort of normalize whenever that happens. How quickly could you reattain that level of35,000 starts? What would it take? Is that something that you think that you could do relatively quickly if market conditions permitted it? And then along with that, your lot count, owned lot count declined again this quarter. And I'm curious, do you expect it to decline further into the first half of 2023?\nRyan Marshall: Well, Stephen, so there's a lot to unpack there. I will try and touch on as many as I can, and I will ask Bob for a little bit of help here. I'll maybe start with your starts question. We've got 211,000 lots that we control, half of those are owned. We've highlighted with the amount of land that our land spend for the year, which is going to be down substantially from 2022 with the lion's share of kind of what we're going to spend in 2023 be in development. Soon stuff that we've owned and we've purchased and we've underwritten and we're -- and we've got it in the kind of entitlement pipeline, we are going to spend the money to get those communities developed and open. So assuming the market cooperates and we see continued strength, I think that we've got the land pipeline such that we can ramp our production in concert with the consumer behavior. So I feel pretty good about that. And then there are a couple of other pieces there that you asked, Bob, -- maybe help me out here if there is anything that is the answer.\nJim Zeumer: [Indiscernible] lots and what we are going to see in Q1, if there would be further decline. I think it was the \u2026\nRyan Marshall: In lots owned, yes, decline in lots owned this year or next quarter.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, like anything else, it depends on the demand environment, how many homes we close for lots, as an example, part of it will be things that are under option today. Are we able to negotiate? If we so desire a deferral of that. So it's hard to give you an answer on that, Stephen, because we are negotiating contracts all the time.\nStephen Kim: Okay. All right. And what I was also asking, Ryan, was how quickly could you reattain a level of 35,000 starts?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Stephen, that's what I was trying to address with my commentary around land. We have the land pipeline such that we can do it. So really to be dependent on how deep -- how deep is the consumer demand, and can we get the trades back on our job site? It's part of the reason that you've also heard us say that we are going to continue to maintain a level of production that allows us to retain those trades on our job sites. So I think they're linked. It's a hard question to answer because I don't know the answer on when demand is going to return to that level. But suffice it to say, I think we've got a production machine that's capable of delivering that if demand is there.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. This is actually Charles [indiscernible] for Susan. I guess my first question is looking at the improvement in activity that you've seen through January, is it fair at this time to expect to sell space in Q1 to be in line with the pre-pandemic historical seasonality kind of a 30% to 40% improvement sequentially from 4Q to Q1?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: We haven't provided any commentary on the sales environment. And what we've highlighted is that it's variable. So I wouldn't want to try and answer that question for you. That's -- you can decide that?\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Okay. And second, you highlighted the potential to improve cycle times through the year. What are some of the key factors that could lead you to improvements in 2023, maybe between the material supply chain issues versus addressing labor availability challenges in the production?\nRyan Marshall: Well, there's less production overall in the supply chain. So I think we can be more efficient with the labor that's there. And then the biggest issue that contributed to an elongation of cycle times over the last couple of years was impacts to the pandemic. A big part of that was supply chain related. There was also a decent sized piece of it in terms of the work environment, work-from-home, safe work environment, less inspectors in the job sites -- on the job sites, less permit reviewers in municipal offices. I mean it was really a combination of things, but probably the biggest variable that is really -- I don't want to declare victory, but it's probably better than it's been over the last couple of years as the supply chain environment is healing.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A of today's call. I now turn the call over to Mr. Zeumer for closing remarks.\nJim Zeumer: Appreciate everybody's time today. We are certainly around for the remainder of the day if you've got any questions. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you on our next call.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We ended 2022 on a high note as we closed almost 8,900 homes and delivered all-time fourth quarter records with homebuilding revenues of $5.1 billion and earnings of $3.85 per share. These results, in turn, helped PulteGroup finish the year with over $1 billion in cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio below10%. Bob will detail the rest of our Q4 results in a few minutes. Driven by the company's exceptional fourth quarter performance, PulteGroup delivered another year of great financial results. For 2022, our home sale revenues increased 18% over the prior year to $15.8 billion, our reported pre-tax earnings increased by 37% to $3.4 billion and our reported earnings increased 48% to $11.01 per share. These results provided us the flexibility to invest $4.5 billion into the business, while returning over$1.2 billion to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases. Let me just pause right here and thank our entire organization for their efforts in delivering such a great operating and financial results under some challenging market conditions. We are truly fortunate to have such an outstanding team. In assessing our 2022 financial results, we fully appreciate that gains in volume, pricing, gross margin and earnings reflect the stronger demand environment that existed earlier in 2022. As we all know, the Federal Reserve decision to hike rate 7x in 2022 and its fight against inflation is successfully slowing the economy, including housing. For the full year, national new and existing home sales across the country fell 16% and 18%, respectively from 2021. Consistent with the trend of these national numbers, our 2022 net new orders were down roughly 27% from 2021. The softer demand we've experienced as a result of consumers priced out of the market by higher prices and higher mortgage rates, along with those individuals who have moved to the sidelines given market uncertainties and risks. Despite the higher rate environment dominating the national conversation, we saw buyer demand improve as the fourth quarter progressed and can confirm this strength continued through the month of January. We will have to see how things progress from here, but I think this improvement attests to the ongoing desire for homeownership that exists in this country. Net signups both in absolute number and absorption pace increased as we move through each month of the fourth quarter and through the month of January. While seasonal trends have been distorted over the past few years, monthly sales moving higher as the fourth quarter progressed is atypical. In short, we're encouraged by the recent improvement in our new home sales. Based on feedback from our sales offices, buyers have been responding to the decline in mortgage rates. Consistent with this idea, I would add that rate buydowns remain among the top incentives for our customers. Along with the decline in mortgage rates, actions we've taken to help improve overall affordability appear to be gaining traction. In alignment with our strategy to find price and turn our assets, we continue to implement programs that enable consumers to buy homes in today's higher rate environment. The cost of these programs which might include rate buydowns, lower lot premiums, or even price reductions can be seen in our higher Q4 incentives. In the fourth quarter, incentives increased to 4.3% of sales price. On a sequential basis, this is up from 2.2% on closings in the third quarter of 2022. Beyond just adjusting incentives in many of our active communities, we have already introduced smaller floor plans to help lower future prices and associated costs. The introduction of smaller floor plans is just part of a comprehensive effort to lower overall construction costs to help offset the pressure on sales price. The obvious question now is will this strengthening of demand continue? Like all of us on this call, I've heard strong arguments on both sides. But the honest answer is that no one really knows. Home Builders are optimist by nature. And I want to believe that the Fed can orchestrate a soft landing, but the risk of a recession is real. We're currently seeing buyers respond to lower rates, and better pricing. But what happens is fed actions weaken the employment picture is uncertain. With today's volatile market dynamics, one of our frequent conversations with investors is around how Pulte plans to operate its business over the near-term. Given the long timelines associated with land development and home construction, we need to set a plan, but be prepared to adjust as market dynamics require. At a high-level, I'd like to share how we plan to operate the business for the foreseeable future. At our core, we remain a build order builder, but our system operates best with a steady volume of production. As such, our plan for the -- our plan is for a consistent cadence of new starts. This would include starting spec homes on a pace consistent with spec sales. We've shared on prior calls that in the current environment, buyers are showing a preference for homes that have near-term delivery dates. As an example, in the fourth quarter, spec sales represented over 60% of our new orders. Our recent sales show that we are finding the market clearing price using our strategic pricing tools to set price and incentives. Within today's sales environment, we will be intelligent about the process as we optimize our production machine and turn through our land assets. As always, our primary focus will be to deliver strong relative returns on invested capital through the cycle. In planning for 2023, we have assumed our current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the reality for the next several months. Combining our planned starts, with our 18,000 homes currently in production, we expect to have a production universe that will allow us to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023. We have goals in place to reduce cycle time, and our procurement and construction teams are already realizing success in cutting production days, but a lot of work remains to be done. Buyer demand will ultimately determine what the coming year looks like, but this is our operating plan. We see this as a prudent, balanced approach that checks key strategic boxes, namely; we maintain a level of production in our communities, which is critical when negotiating with local trades and suppliers. We keep an appropriate level of specs in production while seeking to control finished inventory, and we continue to turn our assets, generate cash and position the business for the next leg of the housing cycle. Given today's market dynamics, at this time, we will be providing guidance for our first quarter, but not the full year. In sharing our operational approach for 2023, we have hopefully conveyed a thoughtful process and conceptualize the opportunity we see for our business. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Thanks, Bob. For all the financial success that we realized in 2022, I can tell you it was a hard year to navigate. When the year started out, we had almost unlimited demand, but supply chain disruptions resulted in countless bottlenecks and extended build cycles. As the year progressed and rising interest rates push more and more consumers to the sidelines, we initiated a series of operational changes as we quickly adapted to the more competitive market conditions. If there is a silver lining in today's challenging demand environment, I think we have what can be viewed as favorable supply -- as a favorable supply dynamic. Recent figures from the National Association of Relators show the inventory of existing homes for sale at 970,000, or only 2.9 months of supply. Existing homes are our industry's biggest source of competition, so such limited supply is certainly advantageous. As we sit here today, I'm incrementally more optimistic about the year ahead, but as the expression goes, hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I think what we've done -- well, I think that we've done that in terms of how we've setup our business. We head into 2023 with enough units in production to meet demand and with production plans will allow us to continue turning assets. At the same time, we don't have an excess of spec homes in the system that will cause incremental self-inflicted pressures. We are in a strong competitive position within the markets that we serve. We are typically among the biggest builders in our markets, and our ability to serve all price points provides opportunities with land sellers and municipalities. And finally, we are in exceptional financial position with plenty of liquidity, no debt maturities for 3 years and expectations for another year of strong cash flow. There are opportunities to be seized upon even in challenging market conditions. When the time comes, PulteGroup will have the flexibility to take advantage of those opportunities. I will close by again thanking the entire PulteGroup organization for their work this past year to build outstanding homes and to provide an exceptional customer experience. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. John, the improvement really came across the footprint on a relative basis. Speaking geographically, we continue to see strength in Florida and the Southeast. As Bob just highlighted in the last answer, we continue to see great performance out of the Texas markets. And probably one of the more encouraging signs that we've seen as we started to see our Western markets, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Southern California, Northern California, we started to see those markets come back to life. So kind of broad based improvement across the footprint. Truman, I think you've highlighted the variables that are out there. And at this point in time, we've given a guide for Q1. And as I mentioned in my comments, that's the extent of kind of what we are going to provide at this point. Well, Truman, I think, as we've talked about with our land acquisition strategy over the years, we've attempted to stay closer into the core, closer to the job market in some of the retail sectors. We certainly have a sizable first time entry-level buyer business and affordability there matters. So we do have communities that are more in the growth rings and on the -- in the tertiary areas, but I don't believe that our land footprint goes out quite as far as maybe some of our competitors. So what I'd tell you is it kind of depends on -- it's a community-by-community situation that is, as much as anything, from a margin standpoint, dependent on the structure of the land deal. And like, I think, you've heard from us in a lot of situations, we don't underwrite the gross margin, we really focus on underwriting to return. But going back to the question that John asked, we've seen relative strength and improvement in kind of sales across the board, that's not just geographically speaking, but that's community by community as well. Yes, Alan, thanks for the question. I appreciate it, and I think, for those that have followed us for years, yourself in that category, I think everybody is aware that we've implemented a number of really important kind of changes in the way that we operate our business that has driven higher returns over the housing cycle, and certainly, higher margins have been part of that. Those initiatives have touched everything from the way that we design our homes and communities to how we price and sell homes. And a really big part of it is the quality of the dirt that we're buying. A little bit back to the question that Truman announced a minute ago. And the way that we have evaluated and underwritten risk and the associated requisite returns that we ask for as part of the risk associated with those communities. So I think you're seeing -- I think you're certainly seeing that pay off. We have highlighted on this call, in my prepared remarks, the way that we are going to run the business in this environment, which is a tougher operating environment. And we really feel it's important to turn our inventory to get good flow-through and to sell and define kind of a market clearing price. So while we believe that the operating model that we have is a great one, and we are really reaping the rewards from it, we won't be immune to some of the market pressures that are certainly out there. But we think that we are an efficient homebuilder, and we are going to continue to be very disciplined and prudent in the way that we are making pricing decisions. Well, Alan, it's going to be tricky, and I will break down a couple of components that we are looking at on the cost side. We've talked a lot about affordability being the biggest challenge that we've had over the last several quarters. And I think affordability is going to continue to be the theme as we move through kind of 2023, not just in housing, but I think in all consumer spending, consumers are feeling the affordability pinch, and it's part of the reason that we've worked so hard to find prices that we believe help to address some of that affordability pinch. With that comes the cost side that you're appropriately highlighting. We have certainly seen and we've gotten very positive reception from our trade partners around the front end of the house as they've started to see a slowdown in new starts and kind of permits pulled. We've been collaborative in talking about what we're seeing and hearing from consumers. And they really -- they've worked to help reduce costs kind of as we've reduced our prices as well. We've seen a lot of progress with lumber. That's certainly a commodity and those things can kind of change. So we'll keep an eye on that. Probably the thing that I would tell you is going to be hardest on the cost side is the labor side of things. And that's the piece that I think will be sticky. Those wage increases have been real, and I think once those wage increases have been provided or given, they're hard to get back. Not impossible, but the material side -- not saying the material side will be easy, but I think we will likely have more success or easier success on the material side than we will labor. So time will tell as the year plays out. As I highlighted in some of my remarks, we've got some really aggressive goals that our procurement teams are working on to reduce overall costs. Efficient, very efficient answer. Hi, Mike. Yes, Mike, and let me maybe just pick up on the comment you made about the comment I made last quarter about not being margin proud, that's still 100% accurate. And we've tried to reflect that in the way I laid out, we are going to be operating our business, which is to find a market price that will allow us to maintain a predictable and consistent turn of our inventory. It's the way that we can keep this business running efficiently and deliver the high returns that Bob talked about. So while we are -- we would certainly endeavor to do much better from a comparable sales standpoint than what we had in the fourth quarter. I think relative to our peer set, you can see that we are selling homes. And we are going to continue to make sure that we are priced competitively with our market offerings. Yes. So in real math, our lumber load was down about $10,000 in the deliveries. Q1 will have that benefit in it. That obviously impacts the margin guide that we gave. I think you heard Ryan say that labor is actually likely to be a little bit stickier so we don't really know if we're going to be able to drive those costs down. So -- and Ryan, I think, said it well. Lumber is a commodity. We typically have the pricing of the lumber impact our closings two quarters in the future, right, because when we order then build the house so the pricing we feel in the market, we feel in our income statement two or three quarters later. And that's true for most of our commodity pricing. And I would tell you, other than lumber, it's been an inflationary market, so we've seen pressure on pricing. Again, Ryan talked about labor being a little bit sticky. Obviously, we are working with our trades, and it's how we build, where we build, can we help them be more efficient in order to offer us a better price, and that's what our procurement teams are working on right now. And as we highlighted in the prepared commentary, that process, whatever it yields, will impact our margin profile likely late in '23 or even into early '24 by the time those price changes get negotiated and then start flowing into houses that would close with a 6-month build time, again, two, three quarters from now. Yes, Carl, it's a great question. And as I think you're aware, we are really proud of our Delaware business and what it adds to kind of the overall mix of our portfolio. You highlighted that buyer tends to be probably most reactive, positive and negative, to volatility within the broader market. And there's certainly been a fair amount of kind of volatility lately. That tends to cause that buyer to maybe pause as opposed to stop. On the positive side, you highlighted it's a thin resale inventory market. And so I certainly think that buyer has been able to sell their home. They've been able to sell their home, but I think at pretty good price. And on the buy side, they're not necessarily looking for a mortgage or the mortgage they're looking for is pretty small. So there are some puts and takes. A couple of other things that I'd highlight, relative to the other two buyer groups that we serve, they were -- the active adult was in the middle. They weren't quite as strong as the first-time buyer. Again, I think because they don't have to move, they've got options, they can be a little more patient. They were certainly more strong -- or did better than the move-up buyer, I think, mostly driven by the fact that they're not as rate sensitive. So on balance, Carl, we feel pretty good about the active adult space, kind of all things considered. And I think it will continue to be a strong benefit to the overall enterprise. Anthony, we haven't provided that, and so we're not going to reluctantly. Yes. Anthony, I think what I would tell you is that it's fluid. And sometimes things that start as kind of discounts off of a price or adjustments to lot premiums, sometimes those are rolled into kind of base price changes or base price reductions. And so the discount gets embedded over time into kind of what the new market price is. So, to Bob's point, we are not going to probably break it out at this point. But you can see, based on the incentive load that I talked about as well as the kind of reduction of base price, we are finding what we think is the market-clearing price to continue to sell homes. Yes. So in answer to the first question, I think we, on average, been buying 3 to 4 years of land. When you add in development time lines, land is going to be hanging around 4 -- in the neighborhood of 4 years. And so if you think of that, pre-pandemic land would be kind of working its way through the system now. In response to the impairment question, obviously, we do impairment reviews every quarter. We are coming from a pretty strong margin position, but we always look and, for instance, in this most recent quarter, we actually looked at 16communities for impairments and impaired 4 of them for about -- it was about $2 million in costs that flow through the quarter, the other 12 did not. And so I think, absent some real structural shift in the market, I wouldn't anticipate a widespread kind of remark of our book. I think you will continue to see us as we look at this, evaluate communities one by one. And depending on the market conditions for that community, if we are in a position like we were with these four communities in the quarter, we'll adjust. Yes, Mike, we don't -- we've never kind of given that type of kind of inter-quarter trajectory. So we are going to leave it probably where we're at, which is we are optimistic and encouraged, not only based on what we saw things kind of progressed through the fourth quarter, which, as I mentioned, is pretty atypical to see the fourth quarter build strength, but we've certainly seen that strength also continue into January. So cautiously optimistic and rates in that period have certainly been lower. So we think that has contributed. We will see kind of what the Fed does here in the next meeting. But all things considered, the operating environment, which we've -- I think we've talked at [indiscernible] is going to be more difficult. We are pretty pleased with what we are seeing in the sales for [ph]. So, Stephen, let me grab the first piece of that. I will let Bob take the mortgage side. I would tell you rate -- the first, your comment on rate, rate is part of it. What's really driving kind of the sales trajectory right now is affordability, and rate is part of that equation. We've also done things in the way we've repriced, the way we've created incentive loans that have helped so affordability as well. So I think that's a big part of it. I will skip to a couple of things that you said about production. Just to clarify so everybody is on the same page, we've got enough production based on what was already in production, plus what we intend to start that will deliver in this year such that our universe -- our production universe will be big enough such that we'd expect to have enough homes to close, approximately 25,000 homes. So -- and then from a rental -- your rental question, we've targeted -- if you go back to the announcement we made a few years ago that we want to do -- have roughly 7,500 homes over a 5-year period, kind of works out to be about 1,500 homes a year once we get fully kind of ramped up. So fairly small piece of our business, which is kind of how we strategically designed that. And I'll flip it to Bob, and he can talk about the mortgage piece. Well, Stephen, so there's a lot to unpack there. I will try and touch on as many as I can, and I will ask Bob for a little bit of help here. I'll maybe start with your starts question. We've got 211,000 lots that we control, half of those are owned. We've highlighted with the amount of land that our land spend for the year, which is going to be down substantially from 2022 with the lion's share of kind of what we're going to spend in 2023 be in development. Soon stuff that we've owned and we've purchased and we've underwritten and we're -- and we've got it in the kind of entitlement pipeline, we are going to spend the money to get those communities developed and open. So assuming the market cooperates and we see continued strength, I think that we've got the land pipeline such that we can ramp our production in concert with the consumer behavior. So I feel pretty good about that. And then there are a couple of other pieces there that you asked, Bob, -- maybe help me out here if there is anything that is the answer. In lots owned, yes, decline in lots owned this year or next quarter. Yes. Stephen, that's what I was trying to address with my commentary around land. We have the land pipeline such that we can do it. So really to be dependent on how deep -- how deep is the consumer demand, and can we get the trades back on our job site? It's part of the reason that you've also heard us say that we are going to continue to maintain a level of production that allows us to retain those trades on our job sites. So I think they're linked. It's a hard question to answer because I don't know the answer on when demand is going to return to that level. But suffice it to say, I think we've got a production machine that's capable of delivering that if demand is there. Well, there's less production overall in the supply chain. So I think we can be more efficient with the labor that's there. And then the biggest issue that contributed to an elongation of cycle times over the last couple of years was impacts to the pandemic. A big part of that was supply chain related. There was also a decent sized piece of it in terms of the work environment, work-from-home, safe work environment, less inspectors in the job sites -- on the job sites, less permit reviewers in municipal offices. I mean it was really a combination of things, but probably the biggest variable that is really -- I don't want to declare victory, but it's probably better than it's been over the last couple of years as the supply chain environment is healing."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup completed the year by delivering a strong fourth quarter results, the benefits of which can be seen throughout our financial statements. In my analysis of the company's operating and financial performance, I will review our reported numbers as well as our financials adjusted for the specific items Jim noted at the start of this call. PulteGroup's fourth quarter home sale revenues increased 20% over last year to $5.1 billion. Higher revenues for the period were driven by a 3% increase in closings to 8,848 homes in combination with a 17% increase in average sales price to $571,000. The increase in average sales price in the quarter was driven by double-digit gains in pricing across all buyer groups. Our closings for the quarter came in above our Q4 guide as we benefited from higher spec sales that closed in the quarter and a faster-than-anticipated recovery in our Florida operations following the impact of Hurricane Ian. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter was 36% first-time buyers, 39% move-up buyers and 25% active adult. This compares with last year's closings, which were comprised of 33% first time, 42% move-up and 25% active adult. The increase in first-time closings is consistent with changes in our mix of communities and the greater availability of spec homes in our first-time buyer neighborhoods. Our spec strategy emphasizes production within our Centex brand as almost 60% of spec units are in communities targeting first-time buyers. In the quarter, we recorded net new orders of 3,964 homes, which is a decrease of 41% from the same period last year. The decline in orders for the period reflects the ongoing softness in buyer demand caused by the significant increase in interest rates realized in '22 in combination with higher cancellations experienced in the period. As a percentage of sign-ups, the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was 32% compared with 11% last year. Cancellations as a percentage of backlog at the beginning of the quarter totaled 11% in the fourth quarter this year compared with 4% in the fourth quarter last year. I would note that in the 4 years prior to the pandemic, quarterly cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog averaged 10%, so Q4 cancellations in relation to backlog were in line with historic norms. In the fourth quarter, our average community count was 850, which is up 8% from an average of 785 last year. Community count growth reflects new community openings as well as the slower closeout of certain neighborhoods. Based on planned community openings and closings, we expect our average community count in the first quarter of '23 to be flat sequentially or approximately 850 communities. For the remainder of '23, we expect quarterly community count to be up 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. By buyer group, fourth quarter orders to first-time buyers decreased 28% to 1,574, while move-up demand was lower by 56% to 1,241 homes and active adult declined 36% to 1,149 homes. As has been widely discussed, housing demand remains under pressure as higher interest rates and years of price appreciation have stretched affordability for buyers. We ended the quarter with a backlog of 12,169 homes with a value of $7.7 billion. This compares to the prior year backlog of 18,003 homes with a value of $9.9 billion. As Ryan discussed, our objective is to keep turning -- keep inventory turning, which requires that we start an appropriate number of homes. In the fourth quarter, we started approximately 4,000 homes, which is down 50% from the fourth quarter of last year, and, on a sequential basis, down about 40% from the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with a total of 18,103 homes in production, of which 10% were finished. Of our total homes under construction, 43% were spec. This is slightly above our target of having specs comprised approximately 35% of our work in process, but given buyer preference for a quicker close, we are comfortable having a few more homes in production. Based on our production pipeline, we currently expect to deliver between 5,400 and 5,700 homes in the first quarter of the year. As Ryan indicated, for the full year, we will have the production potential to close approximately 25,000 homes. These production numbers assume a continuation of current construction cycle times. Given the price of homes in backlog, the mix of homes we expect to close and the anticipated level of spec closings in Q1, we expect the average sales price for Q1 closings to be between $565,000 to $575,000. At the midpoint, this would be an increase of 12% over the first quarter of '22. In the period, we reported gross margins of 28.8%, which remain near historic highs for the company. This represents an increase of 200 basis points over the comparable prior year period, although down sequentially from the 30.1% gross margin we delivered in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to deliver another strong quarter with Q1 gross margins of 27%, which includes the benefit of lower lumber costs due to the fall in lumber prices in the back half of '22. Any savings from ongoing renegotiation of labor and material contracts will be realized in future quarters, and we will have to see how much of this work benefits our '23 versus our '24 closings. Our reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $351 million, or 6.9% of home sale revenues, includes a net pre-tax benefit of $65 million from adjustments to insurance-related reserves recorded in the period. Exclusive of this benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $415 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues. In Q4 of last year, our reported SG&A expense of $344 million or 8.2% of home sale revenues included a net pre-tax benefit of $23million from insurance-related reserve adjustments [ph]. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $367 million or 8.7% of home sale revenues. With the pullback in overall housing demand, we've worked hard to ensure our overheads are properly aligned with today's tougher operating conditions. As such, we expect SG&A expense in Q1 to be in the range of 10.5%to 11% compared with 10.7% last year. In other words, even with lower closing volumes, we are in a position to realize overhead leverage that is comparable to '22. Reported fourth quarter pre-tax income from our financial services operations was $24 million, down from $55million last year. The decline in pre-tax income reflects both lower profitability per loan and an overall decrease in loan origination volumes as mortgage capture rate declined by 10 percentage points to 75%. In the fourth quarter, we walked away from 21,000 option lots and an associated $900 million in future land acquisition spend. As a result of these actions, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $31 million for the write-off of related pre-acquisition costs and deposits. This charge was offset by a pretax gain of $49 million in JV income associated with the sale of commercial property completed in the quarter. Our reported tax expense for the fourth quarter was $282 million, which represents an effective tax rate of24.2%. Our Q4 taxes included a $12 million charge associated with deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments recorded in the period. We expect our tax rate in the first quarter and for the full year in '23 to be 25%. On the bottom line, our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $882 million or $3.85 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company's net income was $832 million or $3.63 per share. These results compared with prior year reported net income of $663 million or $2.61 per share, and adjusted net income of $637 million or$2.51 per share. Moving past the income statement, we invested $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, with almost 65% of this spend for development of existing land assets. For the full year, we invested a total of $4.5 billion in land, including $1.9 billion of acquisition and $2.6 billion of development spend. Given recent decisions to exit certain option land positions, we ended the year with 211,000 lots under control, which is down 8% from last year and down 13% from the recent Q2 peak of 243,000 lots. With the decision to drop option lot deals over the past two quarters, owned lots currently represent 52% of lots under control. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, given the slowdown in overall housing activity, we plan to dramatically lower our land spend in 2023. At this time, we expect our total land investment to be approximately$3.3 billion, with an estimated 65% of these dollars going toward development of owned land positions. Along with investing in the business, we continue to allocate capital back to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million common shares at a cost of $100 million for an average price of $41.81 per share. PulteGroup continues to maintain one of the most active share repurchase programs in the industry, having repurchased 24.2 million shares of common stock in 2022, or almost 10% of our shares outstanding, for $1.1billion at an average cost of $44.48 per share. In 2022, we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. After allocating capital to the business and our shareholders, we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and a net debt to capital ratio of 9.6%. On a gross basis, our debt to capital ratio was 18.7%, which is down from 21.3% last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Yes. It's interesting. It depends, and I hate to give you the mix, but geographically, it makes a difference. Obviously, we are going to see stronger performance in markets where we are seeing stronger sales activity, I think the Southeast of Florida, specs out West are a little bit more challenged. So it really does matter where. On balance, we've seen -- interestingly, if you think about our Q4 guide for margins, we outperformed it. Part of that was that geographic mix. We've talked about getting more volume out of Florida which is one of our better margin performances, but also because of the relative strength of spec sales, we did a little bit better on those than we anticipated when we gave the guide. Yes. Yes, Mike, I think I understand your question. Hopefully, you appreciate, when we provide commentary on our results, if there are unusual things happening, we tell you about them, whether it's in the form of an adjustment or when we present adjusted data. And to answer your question as directly as I can, there's nothing unusual happening in our margin in the fourth quarter. We are not projecting anything unusual to happen in our margin in the first quarter other than the homes that we are closing. I think if you reflect on the answer that Ryan gave, and I can't comment on the relativity to other people's margins, what they're doing pricing lines, what we're doing pricing wise. We can only comment on what we are doing, which is trying to run a thoughtful business, get to a point where we can offer affordability to the consumer where we can earn a return. So I don't know if that gets where you need to be, but there's nothing unusual happening in our margins. Yes, Mike, hopefully, you can appreciate we -- on our most recent call, had highlighted we would be looking at our overheads to make sure that they are efficient given the scale of the business that we are operating today. We have taken actions on costs, and they are varied by market depending on how that particular market is performing. I think you can and should expect us to always do that, right? I mean we are always looking at it. Are we running an efficient business? As it relates to beyond the first quarter, like everything else, there's -- it's a volatile -- not a volatile, but it's a market in flux. We haven't provided a guide on that. But I can tell you, we will be looking at our overheads as part of -- as we see the business develop, we will develop our plans around overhead spend as well. It's interesting, Carl. I don't know that meaningful, but certainly, you heard a couple of things hopefully from us. 60% of our sales have been spec. They are -- our spec inventory is largely in our first-time communities. Our community count, which was up 8% year-over-year, the preponderance of that is in first-time communities. The mix of our lots looking forward is a little bit richer towards first time. So I wouldn't call it a big shift. But yes, I would tell you that first-time has been -- even if you think about the sales paces in the quarter, the decline was the lowest in that first-time space. So that's where the activity is today. Yes, Mike, we haven't. And to the comment that Ryan just made, I think he said it well. Pricing is dynamic in the market, right? And so if you adjust base pricing, it doesn't show as an incentive, it's just a lower sales price. And so on a relative basis, over time, we are in a position where we haven't given a guide on margin. We have given you what the incentive load went to, which was 4.3%, which is almost double, but there were price changes embedded in that, too, right? So all those things factor in, so the guide we've given for Q1 margin reflects everything that we've done to this point, and I think we will leave it there. Yes. I guess the good news is, Stephen, we haven't seen a change really in people's ability to qualify, or we haven't seen people not being able to qualify increasing in a disproportionate way because of the rising rates. And I think more often than not, people know what they can spend. They're prequalifying as they go through the process. So over the -- I won't say that I know that versus 2019, but if you look back over the last year or 2 we have seen a pretty consistent cadence of the percentage of people that are canceling contracts because they can't qualify. It has not moved materially with the change in rates. Well, like anything else, it depends on the demand environment, how many homes we close for lots, as an example, part of it will be things that are under option today. Are we able to negotiate? If we so desire a deferral of that. So it's hard to give you an answer on that, Stephen, because we are negotiating contracts all the time. We haven't provided any commentary on the sales environment. And what we've highlighted is that it's variable. So I wouldn't want to try and answer that question for you. That's -- you can decide that?"

Q3 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, you may begin.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call for our third quarter ended September 30, 2022. Joining me to discuss PulteGroup's third quarter results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the webcast slides that accompany this call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post a replay of today's call later today. As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by the comments we make today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying webcast slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I suspect that throughout this morning's call, we will find ourselves delineating between the favorable demand environment that existed earlier this year, which drove PulteGroup's third quarter earnings versus the more challenging market conditions we're encountering today. Stating the obvious, the primary difference between the two periods is that mortgage rates have more than doubled since the start of the year to upwards of 7%. Our Q3 earnings reflect the benefits of the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first few months of 2022. The favorable demand and pricing dynamics, which existed at the time are reflected in the 15% or $71,000 increase in the average sales price of closed homes that we reported for our third quarter. Further, even with tight labor and a difficult supply chain, we were able to leverage this pricing gain into a 360 basis point expansion of gross margin and an almost 50% increase in earnings to $2.69 per share. Bob will provide more details on our third quarter results in a few minutes, but it is important to acknowledge the success and recognize the efforts of the entire PulteGroup organization in delivering these great results. If our income statement demonstrates prior demand strength, third quarter order and cancellation rates show the more challenging market dynamics we are operating under today. As we move throughout the quarter, you could almost see demand ebb and flow with the movement of interest rates. Softness in July's home buying demand eased as mortgage rates fell in August. The positive trend in demand was short-lived, however, as interest rates surged higher in September in response to Federal Reserve actions and hawkish commentary from Chairman Powell. The pullback in demand was widespread across geographies and consumer groups as potential home buyers move to the sidelines, some because they can no longer afford a home and others because they were unsure if now it's truly the best time to buy a home. The impact of consumers dealing with issues of financing or fear also extended to our backlog as cancellation rates increased 24% in the quarter. While there are a number of factors influencing housing demand, the rise in mortgage rates has likely had the most significant impact on today's consumers. Based on their commentary, expectations are that the Federal Reserve will continue to aggressively raise rates to control inflation for at least the remainder of 2022 and then likely hold rates higher for longer. Given these market dynamics, we continue to meaningfully adjust our operating practices as we adapt to today's more challenging market conditions. On the sales side, we are working closely with our divisions on a market-by-market and even community-by-community basis to find pricing or buyers are able and are willing to transact. When demand first begin to slow in response to higher rates, incentives in most of our markets were focused on mortgage rate locks and buy downs, as mortgage rates have moved even higher, incentives have extended to other areas, including more aggressive discounting of standing inventory and price reductions. As we move through the third quarter, absorption paces were choppy, but on average, slowed as the quarter progressed. This trend continued into October, although ongoing adjustments to incentives and pricing are gaining some traction with consumers. We've told our divisions to be strategic in their decision-making, but we need to intelligently find the market and turn our inventory. The reality is that, we can't be margin proud, but rather, we need to protect our share of sales within the markets. Housing this front and center in the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation. As the Fed clearly desires, new home sales rates and selling prices are in the process of adjusting lower in response to higher interest rates. With home sales slowing, we are adjusting how we approach ongoing land investment. At the end of the second quarter, we controlled 130,000 lots under auctions. Given the more challenging demand conditions we face today, we are re-underwriting our land deals using price, pace and cost assumptions based on current market conditions, with a view towards assessing whether expected returns still achieve or exceed our required hurdle rates. As a consequence of these reviews, in the third quarter, we canceled agreements accounting for approximately 19,000 lots or 14% of the lots we held via option at the end of the second quarter. In taking these actions, we walked away from almost $800 million of future land acquisition spend. No one wants to write off $24 million of deposits and pre-acquisition spend, but the flexibility to exit these transactions reaffirms the strategic importance of building more optionality into our land pipeline. Homebuyer demand clearly moved lower as the third quarter progressed, but the dramatic and ongoing rise in interest rates likely being the biggest concern for most consumers. However, there are certainly other factors at play, including inflation, fear of recession or increasing concerns about job loss. Given all of these considerations, it is easy to understand why consumers have moved to the sidelines. Having said that, people still desire homeownership and are prepared to buy when they find a compelling offer. Operationally, we are appropriately taking a more defensive posture for at least the near-term as we work to navigate today's more turbulent conditions. We believe this approach is appropriate today, and appreciate that stability whether talking about mortgage rates, the stock market or inflation, maybe what people will need to move off the sidelines and become homebuyers again. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of our Q3 operating and financial results.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. There's a lot to review this quarter, so I'll dive right in. Home sale revenues for our third quarter totaled $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 16% over the same period last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven primarily by a 15% increase in our average sales price to $545,000. The year-over-year increase in average sales price of $71,000 was driven by improved pricing across all buyer groups as first time was up 20%, move-up gained 16% and active adult was up 15%. Unit closings in the quarter increased by 1% over last year to 7,047 homes. It's worth noting that approximately 200 closings that were slated for the fourth -- the third quarter were delayed due to Hurricane Ian as we shut down or slowed operations across a number of our Florida and Carolina markets ahead of the storm. On a year-over-year basis, the mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed slightly as 36% were first-time buyers, 38% were move-up buyers and 26% were active adult buyers. In the prior year, 31% of homes delivered were first-time, 44% were move-up and 25% were active adult. The shift in mix to more first time is in alignment with our strategy of having approximately one-third of our business in the first-time buyer space. Net new orders in the third quarter totaled 4,924 homes, which is a decrease of 28% from last year. The year-over-year decline in orders reflect softer demand, resulting primarily from higher interest rates as our absorption pace fell to 2.0 homes per month, down from three homes per month for the same period last year. Along with a slower pace of sales, our reported net new orders in the third quarter were impacted by a significant increase in cancellations. Our cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%, which compares with 10% in the third quarter of last year and 15% in the second quarter of this year. In the quarter, orders among first-time buyers increased 3% over the prior year as sales benefited from a double-digit increase in community count and the availability of quick move-in homes as the majority of our spec production is in our Centex communities. Orders for move-up buyers were lower by 45% than the prior year, while active adult orders decreased by 31%. Changes in community accounts did not materially impact -- did not materially impact order rates among either of these buyer groups. During the quarter, we operated from an average of 823 communities, which is up 7% from last year. The increase in community count is consistent with our previous guidance and reflects both new store openings and the slower closeout of existing communities. Average community count for the fourth quarter should increase slightly to 840. At quarter end, our backlog totaled 17,053 homes, which is down 14% from the same period last year. While unit backlog is lower, the dollar value of our backlog increased 3% over the prior year to $10.6 billion due to the rise in our average sales prices. We ended the third quarter with a total of 23,010 homes under construction, which is up 22% over last year. Of the units under construction, 65% were sold and 35% were spec. Consistent with comments made on prior earnings calls; we've been working to increase our inventory of spec homes primarily in our Centex communities to better serve first-time buyers. We continued start expects in the third quarter as we have continued to see buyer preference for homes that can close in 30 to 90 days across all buyer groups. At quarter end, we were still well below our commonly used metric of one finished spec per community. However, with 8,000 specs in production, we believe we are well positioned to meet demand and to compete effectively in our markets. Having achieved our targeted level of spec within our production universe, we have now lowered our spec starts and we'll manage our production to maintain the balance of our spec and dirt inventories, with an emphasis on build-to-order production for move-up and active adult consumers. Based on the homes we have in production and current sales rates, we now expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. The decrease in expected deliveries relative to our prior guide reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on our Florida operations. To the last point, while damaged to faulty communities in Florida and the Carolinas was limited, municipal resources are appropriately being diverted to the repair and restoration of services at the expense of getting power to new homes and communities. Based on the mix of homes we expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the average sales price on closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000. At the midpoint of our range, this would be up 15% over last year. Please note that, all of the guidance we provide on this call, including ASP, reflects our current best estimate, but cancellation rates and pricing dynamics as we move through the quarter could impact our actual results. For the third quarter, our homebuilding gross margin was 30.1%, which represents an increase of 360 basis points over the third quarter last year. Referring back to Ryan's opening comments, our third quarter gross margins benefited from the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first half of 2022. These conditions supported the double-digit price increases we show in the quarter and allowed us to cover higher material and labor costs, including elevated lumber prices. The strength of demand in that period can also be seen in our sales discounts, which were only 1% for homes closed in the third quarter. By contrast, discounts on new orders taken in the quarter increased 180 basis points over last year to 2.5%. It's worth noting that, this increase in discounts is in addition to the higher financing incentives we've discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Financing incentives on new orders in the third quarter were 1.9%, which is approximately 80 basis points above last year and our historic average. Given the demand and pricing dynamics we are currently experiencing in the market, in addition to the increase in incentives needed to attract sales, we currently expect our fourth quarter homebuilding gross margin to be approximately 28%. This would represent an increase of 120 basis points over last year, but would be lower sequentially and is down from our previous guide. Given the changing market dynamics, our procurement teams are already having discussions with suppliers and trade partners in an effort to identify opportunities to reduce our land development and house construction costs. However, at this point, any savings we are able to realize would benefit our business in 2023. In the third quarter, our SG&A expense was $350 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. The company remains on track for full year SG&A to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%. Given the pullback in buyer demand and expectations that market dynamics will remain challenging for summer all of 2023, we are taking needed actions to better align overheads with current demand. For the third quarter, higher gross margin and greater overhead leverage helped PulteGroup generate an operating margin of 21%, which represents an increase of 410 basis points over the prior year. Turning to financial services. Our operations continue to face extremely challenging market conditions. In the third quarter, our reported pre-tax income totaled $28 million, which is down from $49 million last year. In the quarter, lower loan origination volumes driven in part by a lower capture rate and decreased profitability per loan were the primary drivers of the decline in pre-tax income. Capture rate for the quarter was 77% compared with 85% last year as our mortgage business seeks to be competitive but not to chase unprofitable business. Our tax expense for the third quarter was $183 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.6%. Our taxes in the third quarter include federal energy-efficient home credits, which were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted into law in August of this year. In total, PulteGroup's reported net income for the third quarter increased to $628 million or $2.69 per share. The company's prior year net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share. In the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase activity, buying 4.4 million shares or another 2% of our outstanding common shares for $180 million or an average price of $41.20 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we have repurchased approximately 9% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of the year for $975 million. Along with buying back stock, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the quarter, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets. As Ryan discussed, in response to changing market conditions, we are re-underwriting every land transaction based on current price, pace and cost dynamics. We ended the third quarter with approximately 232,000 lots under control, which is down 11,600 lots from the end of the second quarter of this year due in large part to the deals we elected to terminate. At quarter end, 50% of our total land pipeline was controlled via option and we continue to work toward our long-term goal of getting to 65% to 70%. While we have terminated a number of transactions, there are land positions that we have under control that we still project to achieve or exceed our required rates of return. As a result, we currently expect to close on such transactions and expect our result in full year land investment to be approximately $4.8 billion, which is in line with our prior guide. Given the change in buyer demand and the resulting impact on the turning of our own land inventory, we currently expect that our land spend will drop materially next year. While we are still in the planning process, our preliminary estimate is that land acquisition and development spend in 2023 will drop by $1.5 billion to approximately $3.3 billion. Of this spend, we expect that upwards of two-thirds will be for the development of existing land assets. We will provide more details on next year's planned land acquisition and development spend during our Q4 earnings call. We ended the quarter with $291 million in cash and had $319 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. Our drawings under the revolving credit facility were driven primarily by our land acquisition and development spend, an increase in our house inventories as we move homes through production and the delay in closings related to Hurricane Ian. Our debt-to-capital ratio at quarter end was 22.5%. Wrapping up the higher interest rates being orchestrated by the Federal Reserve are achieving the Fed's objective in terms of slowing demand and negatively impacting price appreciation in the market. While conditions have gotten tougher, I am confident in PulteGroup's competitive position and in our ability to successfully work through this phase of the housing cycle. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Looking at the tables in this morning's press release, you can see that on a year-over-year basis, our net new orders were lower across the country, although we continue to see relative outperformance in Florida, Texas and the Southeast. Generally, we are faring better in markets where buyers can still find affordability. In contrast, conditions in our western markets are clearly more difficult as price appreciation, generally higher selling prices and the spike in mortgage rates have force buyers to pause their buying plans. The softer demand conditions that we experienced in the third quarter continued into October and have likely gotten even more challenging with mortgage rates now pushing 7%. Running a homebuilding company during this part of an economic cycle is complicated, but we are fortunate to have an experienced leadership team that knows how to operate the business. We are taking action to impact the critical areas of the business, including finding price at a community level where we can sell homes. We will do the best we can to protect backlog, but we won't sit on inventory. With the right level of home inventory to meet demand and to compete effectively, we are aligning starts with the ongoing pace of sales and remain committed to our build-to-order model. We remain disciplined in our approach to land acquisition. It's hard to cancel a land deal that you've worked on for months or even years, but if the return is no longer pencil then we will walk away. We will work intelligently with our suppliers and trade partners to adjust costs given the new market pricing dynamics. And we will continue to evaluate and adjust our overhead spending and changes in current \u2013 to changes in current and expected construction volumes. For all the defensive actions we are implementing, I remain constructive on long-term housing demand. While we expect the coming quarters will be difficult for the industry, long-term dynamics for housing remain positive. If the Federal Reserve just pauses, or if the stock market doesn't swing 5% in a single day, or if inflation starts to ease, that might go a long way towards giving consumers enough confidence to get back into the market. While we wait for conditions to stabilize, we will be aggressive in managing our day-to-day business to sell homes, efficiently run our operations intelligently manage land investment and work to deliver high returns. I want to recognize our employees for their tremendous work in delivering a great third quarter. I also want to call out our teams impacted by Hurricane Ian. You have done tremendous work taking care of each other and the communities you serve. Before opening the call to questions, I want to provide a quick comment on the second press release we issued this morning. After a 30-plus year career with our company, John Chadwick, PulteGroup Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has announced his plans to retire in 2023. John has had an amazing career with our organization, and has been instrumental in its success over the years. I know, I speak for our Board and our entire company in wishing John all the best in retirement. Brandon Jones, Senior Vice President, Field Operations, has been named to replace John effective January 1, 2023, as Chief Operating Officer. Brandon began his Pulte career 18 years ago as the Director of Operations in Arizona and has held a series of field positions of increasing responsibility, including Division President, in several markets and Area President of our Southeast area. Since being named Senior Vice President of Operations in 2021, Brandon has been managing our construction operations throughout the country, so I expect the seamless transition into his new role. John will remain with the company through April of next year to assist with the changeover. We are fortunate to have a deep and talented bench within PulteGroup, and I look forward to advancing the great partnership Brandon and I have built over the years. Now let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions so we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And now, Chris, if you will explain once again how to ask questions, we'll get started with Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open.\nCarl Reichardt: Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Ryan, can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned October pricing and it's the -- in October, you saw some pricing and incentives in certain markets are starting to have some traction. Can you expand a little bit on that, sort of, where and what you're doing where you might be seeing at least a little bit of stabilization in absorptions?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Carl. I appreciate the question this morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is we've worked through the changing market conditions over the last three to four months, early on our incentives were largely financing-related incentives, things that aimed at buying the rate down, extended rate locks, things of that nature. We felt early on that we were getting traction with consumers, especially when you could provide interest rates that were sub-5%. And in some cases, we were able to even get sub-4% with the incentives. As rates have pushed up into the 7% range, we're finding those things to be less effective. And so we've really focused the majority of our energy on pricing to what we believe current market conditions are. So price rollbacks and price drops. We have been strategic in those, Carl, but as I've talked about, we've worked to protect backlog as best we can, but we really feel it's important to continue to move inventory and to maintain the market share that we've worked so hard to get in the market. It's really those price rollbacks that we've seen get some traction over the last two to three weeks. And so we do feel while it's tough, we are encouraged with the activity that we're seeing.\nCarl Reichardt: All right. Thanks Ryan. And then can you talk a little bit about can rates by buyer segment and how those might compare currently to what your long-term averages are? Thanks.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. We typically don't give that level of detail, Carl. What we have seen with cans is a little bit of a change versus where we were three months ago, we were seeing churn in the 30 to 60 days. What we have seen is a little bit more cancellation for folks that have been in backlog a little bit longer, and it's that rapid and substantial rate increase from when they signed. So at the end of the day, I think -- I don't think that we're surprised by that, but we have seen a little bit of movement from people that have been in backlog a little bit longer.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay.\nRyan Marshall: The one comment I would offer to that, Carl, is we have historically seen the lowest can rate out of our active adult consumer that's a buyer that's not as heavily dependent on financing. That's been consistent over the years, and the trends that we're seeing today continue to support that.\nCarl Reichardt: Great Ryan. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Carl.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys for all the color and good job in the quarter in a tough market. Wanted to ask you a question related to your strategy going \u2013 your strategy in light of the tremendous mortgage rate volatility that we've seen. I mean, obviously, in the last couple of months, it's just been volatility to the upward direction. But with the spreads over the 10-year treasury being what they are, there's a lot of thought that you might see a drop actually in mortgage rates at some point, tough to predict. You don't want to assume that, but I was curious to what degree you're ready for that, if it were to happen in the next several months. So, do you have a marketing plan to be proactive in the event you do see rates drop, let's say, mortgage rates drop back into the low sixes, let's say? Do you have a list of buyers who couldn't qualify today but could if you had a lower 6% rate? And can you give us a sense for how big that list might be?\nRyan Marshall: Well, Stephen, let me maybe just start with saying we've got \u2013 we've got a really outstanding sales and marketing team that has always focused on the basics of working our entire lead funnel. And that hasn't changed in good market times or even these more challenging market times. So our ability to get relevant and timely messages out to our sales funnel, I'm very confident in our ability to do that. So if we're so fortunate to see rates drop. I know that, we can get the right messaging out to let folks know are \u2013 we really emphasize and push with our local sales professionals as well to maintain the relationships with our lead banks and with our interested buyers at a very local and personal level. So I think there's multiple ways using kind of the big bullhorn of the corporate marketing platform, but you've also got the grassroots local relationships with our sales professionals. Maybe just the last thing is I think the market itself, if we were so fortunate to see rates come back I think we'll probably be the greatest marketing machine of any of them.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully, people have their ear to the ground. Great. Secondly, can we talk about production, could you give us your sticks and bricks figure to start with? And then when I look at your level of homes under construction, your inventory homes \u2013 or I'm sorry, your spec levels per community, the number of total specs you have per community. You were at 9.8%, if I \u2013 if my math is right, that's pretty significantly higher than what you were running at pre-pandemic, but you're also intentionally doing more specs. So I'm curious, what is the level of specs per community that \u2013 this is total specs, by the way, that we could expect by the end of the year?\nRyan Marshall: Stephen, Jim will give you the sticks and bricks, and then I'll take the second piece of the question.\nJim Ossowski: Under production, we've got $3.164 billion, and then we have another $328 million in models for sticks and bricks.\nRyan Marshall: And then, Stephen, as to your question on our level of spec inventory, we're \u2013 we've been talking for the better part of the last two to three quarters about our desire to have more spec inventory in the system. Over the last three to four months as the market has slowed we've seen a real preference for homes that are able to deliver in the next 30 to 90 days, and that continues to this very moment. In terms of the inventory we have in our system, 35% of our leap [ph] is spec, and that is right where we want to be. So we feel very comfortable with respect to that. Looking at the finished inventory, we continue to have less than one finished home per active community, which has always been our historical benchmark. So we also feel comfortable that we're not under any pressure with finished inventory. We continue to see good flow-through of our sales rate of specs that are being sold and that are delivering in the near term, which is a real positive for us. And then maybe just the last thing, Stephen, and you've seen this transition over the last couple of years, as we've moved more of our business to the first-time entry-level product, we've intentionally put more spec inventory into those first-time entry level communities. And certainly, that's where the higher percentage of our spec inventory resides. So we feel comfortable with that. The last thing and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, as it relates to forward starts of new inventory, we've significantly slowed that, and we're matching that to what our sales rate is. So we think we've done exactly what we said we were going to do and we've made additional adjustments based on how we see market conditions at the moment.\nStephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but just what as a percent of price or sales price, what were incentives running during the quarter and where did you end, and if that includes price adjustments as well?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. So in the most recently printed quarter today, third quarter, our incentive load was 1% on closing. And that is a little bit better than last year, 30 basis points better than closings during the third quarter of last year. What we did highlight was on the sales in this quarter, so not the closings, but the sales that rate ran up to about 2.5%. So running higher and also that financing incentives, and we talked about this in the second quarter, we're up over sales in the third quarter of last year, so that the total load of incentive is up on current sales, by a couple of hundred basis points versus the closings that we had in this quarter. So then that will influence our business over that couple of quarters as those homes close.\nRyan Marshall: Mike, the only -- in addition to Bob's comments, I'd just highlight that as we make price adjustments, those adjustments are made to base price. And so those adjustments aren't going to necessarily show up in the incentives that Bob just described. And we've talked about it for the last several quarters as well as we're opening new communities, which there are a fair number of those. We've been very intentional in pricing to the current market such that you have -- what we believe is a more normal incentive load.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. That's -- I appreciate that. I mean that's exactly what I was trying to get at in terms of where you are today. You kind of mentioned that, as the quarter progressed, you took perhaps a little bit more of an aggressive posture and as I said, trying to meet the market with price reductions and I'm sure price adjustments. So just trying to get a sense, I guess, as you've taken those actions maybe over the last 30, 45 days, if you could give us any sense in terms of what percent of ASP, those price adjustments or reductions might have amounted to at this point? And I would assume that that's something that we wouldn't see in the gross margin until the first half of next year?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah, Mike, it's \u2013 there's so much detail behind that, where \u2013 what the price points are. You can see, though, our sign-up \u2013 average price for sign-ups is down by about 6%. That certainly reflects some of the current pricing. You have to be a little bit careful because our sign-ups were a little bit more skewed towards first time, and so mix matters in that. So I wouldn't want to put a number on x percent down, because it really varies by market, by community. But again, you can see that ASP is likely to come down and there will be some margin consequence. And you can see it in the guide that we gave, where we at 28%.\nRyan Marshall: And then Mike, to your margin question, yes, a lot of that will certainly be next year for homes that are on a build-to-order model. If it was a spec home, then those will show up more likely than not in the fourth quarter, and that is incorporated into the margin guide that Bob gave for the fourth quarter. Depending on kind of the nature of the adjustments we've made, some of those incentives also have flown into backlog as we work to protect the backlog and get those homes closed as well. That's also incorporated into the guide for the fourth quarter.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. One last quick one, if I could. Order trends by month, sometimes you were able to give that out. Just you kind of mentioned that, there was few differences a little bit as rates kind of fluctuated a little bit during the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of year-over-year trends and as you say that October kind of remained a little soft, if any sense of that type of number as well?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. Without getting into the detail month by month, I think you heard it in Ryan's prepared comments. The demand equation followed the rate movements. And so you saw a little bit of a dip in rates in August. We saw some activity around that, where people came off the fence as rates progressed higher after that, we saw a relative decrease in demand.\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask on this $24 million write-down, obviously, small kind of in and of itself. But can you kind of speak or sort of how do you think about the risk of maybe larger write-downs occurring in that particular bucket where you saw it in the deposits bucket? And then ultimately, as this market evolves from here, what's the risk of write-down spreading to sort of the owned land portfolio? Thank you.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. It's interesting. The market will tell us that. I don't want to predict. We've got obviously call it, $400 million, $450 million of total money at risk around option deals. So that's going to be pre-acquisition spend, legal, et cetera, as well as deposits. You heard us say and we've been doing this for a while now, we're reevaluating every land transaction. And it's interesting because we made the point in the prepared remarks we have been closing on a lot of transactions. And our expectation is that we will for the balance of the year, there will be some stuff that we walk away from. I wouldn't want to try and quantify it. But part of the reason our land spend is projected to go down next year is because it's getting harder to make stuff work, especially in things that were negotiated more recently. So as that stuff comes to the table, I think we're going to have some questions to answer internally as to whether it still meets our return requirements. The good news is, and again, it was in Ryan's prepared remarks, the 11,600 lots that we walked away from had a land act spend of $800 million. And if we had bought all that land at a point in time, that might have been some tough markets that we would have had to work through. So we feel -- and Ryan said it, we don't feel good about a $24 million charge. Having said that, having to work through $800 million of land with, oh, by the way, a lot of development spend on top of that. So we feel like it's actually operating the way we are as we look at the market, we're trying to get more of that optionality into our book. We've targeted 65% to 70%. We're pushing our teams to look for optionality, whether it be in time or take down. So I think -- I don't want to guess at what the market is going to bring to us. We'll work through each transaction as we go.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that Bob. And then I guess the second one zooming into the margin guide. I think the Q4 guide is for -- margin is down 200 basis points sequentially. I know you mentioned everything around incentives and the change in price, perhaps more impactful to 2023. I think, Ryan, you just said that there's certainly some spec impact there in the Q4 guide. But just given a lot of these changes won't flow through into 2023, I'm just curious if you can bridge us to that 200 basis points decline in Q4 and why this margin decline is happening this quickly? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Matt, it was really wrapped up and I think the prior answer that I gave. As we looked at what we'll close in the fourth quarter, it incorporates specs that have been sold, some specs that still need to be sold, as well as some adjustments that flowed through the backlog based on pricing adjustments that we made in active communities. Those are the big drivers that are influencing the Q4 guide. The only other piece that I would add is there's a little bit of continued labor pressure with back-end trades, specifically the finished trades for what is still a pretty heavy load of inventory that's moving not only through our production machine, but the industry's production machine. We are starting to see some of that subside on the front end of things as starts have started to come down, and it's given us better ability to have productive conversations with front-end trades, as we work to pull costs back that are responsive to the dynamic environment that we're seeing.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: The next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. As demand has slowed and you've pulled the price lever to maintain volumes, is there a base level of absorptions we should think about as being a floor before you start to maybe see some diseconomies of scale? And is it possible to talk about what you see as maybe an ideal absorption pace, understanding it's a very dynamic market?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Anthony, it's a fair question, and I'll go back to what I think we've talked about for years. We really look to maximize return and so we're focused on both the pace and the price kind of levers. I would tell you, we'd like to see more volume than what we're currently seeing. But as I highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're trying to be strategic and take a long-term view of that's really underpinned by what we still see as a very positive housing market. Unfortunately, we've had a doubling of interest rates in 10 months, which we've never seen in this country, at least not in the last four years. And that's coming on the heels of an unprecedented global pandemic. It's created certainly some dynamics that we're being responsive to, but we're not going to overreact.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on your comment on trades and some of those discussions becoming more constructive, can you quantify the extent to which your cycle times increased in the quarter or decreased, if at all? And would you expect a shortening of cycle times maybe in 4Q or early next year?\nRyan Marshall: Anthony, we're \u2013 as I highlighted in maybe my previous question, we're continuing to see some back-end labor pressure with the finished trades. And then at the current environment, we haven't seen a bunch of progress with cycle times. We're still running right around six months, which is kind of unchanged from where we were in the prior quarter. I wouldn't expect to see any improvement in Q4. There's just too much production still on the machine. I am very focused with our production teams to claw back cycle time in 2023. So my hope would be by the time we hit Q2, Q3, Q4 of next year, we're starting to see some meaningful kind of quarter-over-quarter improvement as we get back to more typical cycle times. So I'm confident based on the drop in volume, but also just the healing of the supply chain, which continues to get better and better \u2013 that, that can become a reality in 2023 and beyond.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nOperator: The next question is from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nIvy Zelman: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I appreciate all the information. Maybe, Ryan, you could just speak to sort of broadly the consumer that has already put an order in \u2013 in backlog and the cancellations that you're seeing. Is this a function of how much of a function of not being able to afford the monthly payment versus how many people are just getting cold feet and walking away from built in equity? And then just more broadly, I get a lot of questions from clients, if you look at where rates are today, approaching 7%, what has that done in general to prospective buyer pool? Like where do you see? Is it now 25% of prospective buyers can't afford you more? I mean we see affordability as probably the most stretch it's been going back several decades. So maybe you can help us understand what needs to happen with respect to getting buyers more comfortable given such elevated pricing and the dynamics that led us here?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Ivy, thanks for the questions. I appreciate it. In terms of the cancellations that we're seeing, it's both. We're absolutely seeing buyers that can no longer afford, we're also seeing buyers that still can't afford, but they've gotten cold feet for whatever reasons. And in many cases, they're walking away from pretty sizable earnest money deposits that economically don't make a ton of sense, but that's where you really get into the psychology. They're just not confident in making a purchase. I'd tell you, as we look at the trends over the last couple of quarters, we haven't seen a noticeable or a significant change in the mix of reasons why folks are canceling. That's been pretty consistent. In terms of the buyer pool, Ivy, it's understandably less, and I'll specifically focus on who can afford as the industry is going through some pricing adjustments, I think we are working to get more people into that pool. The pool that's harder to quantify, and I'm not even going to attempt to guess is how many people are on the sideline because of psychological fear. Those folks just aren't engaging with us. They're waiting. And as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, I think the only way we get that buyer back into the market is through stability and those are unfortunately things that we don't directly control. So -- and we've highlighted what we think they are.\nIvy Zelman: No, that's helpful, Ryan. And just if I could just follow-up on my second question as it relates to underwriting land right now and appreciating that you've taken some option on abandonments. Given the returns that are currently forecasted with the new pricing on communities that have not been yet open, but are slotted to be open? Are we talking gross margins that would hit the return requirements because you have always been underwriting to a much lower gross margin than you're currently, obviously, achieving? So should we expect margins to be more normalized on whatever you're moving forward with new communities given the pricing environment, or is there a risk that could even be below normal at this point? Maybe you could just qualitatively give us some direction?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Ivy. What I'd highlight is we underwrite return, we've never underwritten the margin. And so the screen that we're using in the current environment is we're using current pace and price against the historical return on invested capital screen and risk grid that we've always used. And we have not compromised on that. The -- so the deals that we've elected to walk away from simply don't meet that screen. The ones that we've elected to move forward with, by and large, continue to meet our return-based screen and that includes margins that are all over the board in terms of the historical range that we've typically operated. And Bob, anything you'd add in terms of underwriting? So hopefully, Ivy, that helps in terms of your question.\nOperator: The next question is from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one is just given the more cautious near-term stance, pulling back on land spend, which is clearly prudent in our view. I mean, where do you intend to allocate the capital? I mean, could you be more aggressive on buybacks or continue to be aggressive on buybacks?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yeah. We'll go through the same exact exercise we always have. It's interesting we highlighted in this call. We are out on our revolver, which is \u2013 we started borrowing a little bit last quarter. We're actually out on the line today first and foremost, we'll pay that off. Our expectation is that we'll be able to do that in short order. Then what we always do is look at what the next several years. So it's not a point in time, capital generation and usages and we'll consider investment in land. We've highlighted that we think spend is going to be down, we'll be building and monetizing our backlog. So we think we're going to be cash flow positive. And so we'll look at the capital base that we've got and what to do. And we'll have choices. We can \u2013 we will obviously continue our dividend. We can look at share repurchases. We will also be looking at our leverage. Obviously, the run-up in rates makes our debt a little more attractive on a pricing basis. Not suggesting, we're going to do anything, but it's \u2013 and we look at these things consistently through time, and we'll consider all those things. But I think you can \u2013 should expect to see us in market for equity, and we'll look at any other use of cash at the same time.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of thinking about your overall land spend strategy now and just land in general, are you actually pulling back on community openings \u2013 communities that were slated to open? Are you holding back those given the demand environment?\nRyan Marshall: Not at all. We're continuing to move forward with it and open those communities. And in fact, some of the communities that we've recently opened have been some of our brightest and best performers, which is really encouraging. I think there's two reasons for that, John. One, these are good communities and good locations that have got great interest lists that we've been working for a long time referencing back to the marketing comment that was asked a little bit ago. We've also been very deliberate in making sure that we're pricing the current market. Now, we do that all the time when we open up new communities, but especially in light of the current environment, when we're opening, we're making sure that we're opening at a value, and we've seen traction there. So communities that are opening today have been in our pipeline for a long time. They were bought right. They were arguably developed at a pretty attractive cost basis as well. And so we can continue to deliver nice margins and more importantly, good returns out of those communities.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, just maybe a follow-up on Ivy's questions around cancellations and maybe it's \u2013 I don't know if it's a terminology issue in terms of talking affordability versus outright qualification \u2013 challenges, but Ryan or Bob, could you address what percentage of your cancellations or as you're kind of hearing from the field around prospective buyers, how you're seeing outright inability to qualify impact versus just a, hey, maybe I can qualify, but I can't actually afford the x dollars a month in incremental payments.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Looking. I don't -- we're going to have to get back to you on that. What I could tell you is that it is again, running at a consistent percentage. We haven't seen a run up in the percentage of people who just don't outright qualify or rejections. So -- but what the relative percentage of that is, I don't know off the top of my head.\nMike Dahl: Okay, got it. And then in terms of thinking through as are, obviously, pretty diversified in your market exposures in past cycles, you've seen builders of exiting markets during contraction periods. When you look at your land positions, when you look at some of the relative results across some of these markets, obviously, everything is getting hit, but some things harder than others. Are you at the point where you're evaluating whether or not certain markets makes sense, or maybe if there's any other regional color you can provide around something like that?\nRyan Marshall: No, Mike, we actually feel really good about our geographic footprint. We've entered into several new markets over the last three to four years, and we're as confident in those today as we were when we made the decision to go there. A lot of the places that we've entered into in recent years have been places that have had really attractive job growth and really nothing's changed along those lines. There are also places that are attractive climates. They generally tend to be more affordable places and there are locations that are predominantly in the Sunbelt. So we think our new market expansion strategy still makes a ton of sense. In terms of our existing markets, we're really happy with them. I wouldn't -- I don't know that I have any real additional color to add in terms of the geographies that are doing well versus not other than what I highlighted in my prepared remarks. The Western markets are the toughest for sure. I think that's been widely reported by -- for many sources. We're also seeing relative softness in the Northeast, some of the more expensive locales. The Southeast, Florida, Texas, relatively or performing better for a lot of the reasons that I just touched on as with my comments on expansion markets.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Final question today is from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTruman Patterson: Hey good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. First, we've had a nice run of lower realtor and broker commissions throughout 2021 and the first part of 2022. I'm just seeing if you all started to pull that lever to help augment sales, especially with quick move-in homes are generally preferred by realtors. So just seeing if you're increasing commissions there? And if so, what impact that could be to SG&A?\nRyan Marshall: Truman, the view that we've had on realtor commissions through time is to be balanced with it. We certainly appreciate when relators are the procuring cause or our \u2013 truly bring kind of a buyer into our sales office and help with that process. We've paid, I think, a market competitive broker commission. We're still in the same position today. So there's certainly cases here and there where you may have an above average broker commission, as an incentive to move a particular property that's got a unique set of circumstances, but broadly, you won't see us as a strategy employ above average broker commissions.\nTruman Patterson: Got you. Okay. But for the industry, has it generally kind of ticked up across the board or specific bonuses, et cetera?\nRyan Marshall: I think it depends on the market and it depends on the builder. I think there are certain builders that part of their strategy \u2013 their marketing strategy is largely directed toward outsized or above average broker commissions. So as the market gets tougher, you're seeing certain competitors that use that as maybe their primary marketing tool, you're starting to see those bigger numbers come into play.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Got you. And then could you all discuss \u2013 Ryan, you mentioned earlier about negotiations with trades and building products. But \u2013 could you discuss if you're getting any early traction on the price negotiations of any specific trades like framers or materials, building product categories \u2013 really outside of lumber?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Truman, it's really the \u2013 we've been talking with all of our trades, but I would tell you the more kind of recent and impactful conversations have been with the front-end trades \u2013 so underground plumbing foundation up through shell, exterior shell, those conversations have been frequent and helpful. Those are the trades that are feeling the slowdown in the industry right now. And so as they evaluate their kind of business situation and kind of the volume that they would like to be doing and what efficiencies look like. We're engaged in what I would tell you, are productive conversations. We need to pull cost out of housing generally. That's our organization, and that's our trades as well. I think we can all appreciate that we've seen unprecedented inflation, both in materials and labor. And those costs are real. And so I think we're trying to take a pragmatic but very intentful approach in how we try to pull cost out of the system.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Got you. Thank you. And good luck in the upcoming quarter.\nRyan Marshall: Thank you, Truman.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJim Zeumer: I appreciate everybody's time today. So we could not get through all the questions, but we'll be available over the remainder of the day. Certainly, feel free to call or e-mail. Outside of that, we will look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I suspect that throughout this morning's call, we will find ourselves delineating between the favorable demand environment that existed earlier this year, which drove PulteGroup's third quarter earnings versus the more challenging market conditions we're encountering today. Stating the obvious, the primary difference between the two periods is that mortgage rates have more than doubled since the start of the year to upwards of 7%. Our Q3 earnings reflect the benefits of the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first few months of 2022. The favorable demand and pricing dynamics, which existed at the time are reflected in the 15% or $71,000 increase in the average sales price of closed homes that we reported for our third quarter. Further, even with tight labor and a difficult supply chain, we were able to leverage this pricing gain into a 360 basis point expansion of gross margin and an almost 50% increase in earnings to $2.69 per share. Bob will provide more details on our third quarter results in a few minutes, but it is important to acknowledge the success and recognize the efforts of the entire PulteGroup organization in delivering these great results. If our income statement demonstrates prior demand strength, third quarter order and cancellation rates show the more challenging market dynamics we are operating under today. As we move throughout the quarter, you could almost see demand ebb and flow with the movement of interest rates. Softness in July's home buying demand eased as mortgage rates fell in August. The positive trend in demand was short-lived, however, as interest rates surged higher in September in response to Federal Reserve actions and hawkish commentary from Chairman Powell. The pullback in demand was widespread across geographies and consumer groups as potential home buyers move to the sidelines, some because they can no longer afford a home and others because they were unsure if now it's truly the best time to buy a home. The impact of consumers dealing with issues of financing or fear also extended to our backlog as cancellation rates increased 24% in the quarter. While there are a number of factors influencing housing demand, the rise in mortgage rates has likely had the most significant impact on today's consumers. Based on their commentary, expectations are that the Federal Reserve will continue to aggressively raise rates to control inflation for at least the remainder of 2022 and then likely hold rates higher for longer. Given these market dynamics, we continue to meaningfully adjust our operating practices as we adapt to today's more challenging market conditions. On the sales side, we are working closely with our divisions on a market-by-market and even community-by-community basis to find pricing or buyers are able and are willing to transact. When demand first begin to slow in response to higher rates, incentives in most of our markets were focused on mortgage rate locks and buy downs, as mortgage rates have moved even higher, incentives have extended to other areas, including more aggressive discounting of standing inventory and price reductions. As we move through the third quarter, absorption paces were choppy, but on average, slowed as the quarter progressed. This trend continued into October, although ongoing adjustments to incentives and pricing are gaining some traction with consumers. We've told our divisions to be strategic in their decision-making, but we need to intelligently find the market and turn our inventory. The reality is that, we can't be margin proud, but rather, we need to protect our share of sales within the markets. Housing this front and center in the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation. As the Fed clearly desires, new home sales rates and selling prices are in the process of adjusting lower in response to higher interest rates. With home sales slowing, we are adjusting how we approach ongoing land investment. At the end of the second quarter, we controlled 130,000 lots under auctions. Given the more challenging demand conditions we face today, we are re-underwriting our land deals using price, pace and cost assumptions based on current market conditions, with a view towards assessing whether expected returns still achieve or exceed our required hurdle rates. As a consequence of these reviews, in the third quarter, we canceled agreements accounting for approximately 19,000 lots or 14% of the lots we held via option at the end of the second quarter. In taking these actions, we walked away from almost $800 million of future land acquisition spend. No one wants to write off $24 million of deposits and pre-acquisition spend, but the flexibility to exit these transactions reaffirms the strategic importance of building more optionality into our land pipeline. Homebuyer demand clearly moved lower as the third quarter progressed, but the dramatic and ongoing rise in interest rates likely being the biggest concern for most consumers. However, there are certainly other factors at play, including inflation, fear of recession or increasing concerns about job loss. Given all of these considerations, it is easy to understand why consumers have moved to the sidelines. Having said that, people still desire homeownership and are prepared to buy when they find a compelling offer. Operationally, we are appropriately taking a more defensive posture for at least the near-term as we work to navigate today's more turbulent conditions. We believe this approach is appropriate today, and appreciate that stability whether talking about mortgage rates, the stock market or inflation, maybe what people will need to move off the sidelines and become homebuyers again. Let me now turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed review of our Q3 operating and financial results. Looking at the tables in this morning's press release, you can see that on a year-over-year basis, our net new orders were lower across the country, although we continue to see relative outperformance in Florida, Texas and the Southeast. Generally, we are faring better in markets where buyers can still find affordability. In contrast, conditions in our western markets are clearly more difficult as price appreciation, generally higher selling prices and the spike in mortgage rates have force buyers to pause their buying plans. The softer demand conditions that we experienced in the third quarter continued into October and have likely gotten even more challenging with mortgage rates now pushing 7%. Running a homebuilding company during this part of an economic cycle is complicated, but we are fortunate to have an experienced leadership team that knows how to operate the business. We are taking action to impact the critical areas of the business, including finding price at a community level where we can sell homes. We will do the best we can to protect backlog, but we won't sit on inventory. With the right level of home inventory to meet demand and to compete effectively, we are aligning starts with the ongoing pace of sales and remain committed to our build-to-order model. We remain disciplined in our approach to land acquisition. It's hard to cancel a land deal that you've worked on for months or even years, but if the return is no longer pencil then we will walk away. We will work intelligently with our suppliers and trade partners to adjust costs given the new market pricing dynamics. And we will continue to evaluate and adjust our overhead spending and changes in current \u2013 to changes in current and expected construction volumes. For all the defensive actions we are implementing, I remain constructive on long-term housing demand. While we expect the coming quarters will be difficult for the industry, long-term dynamics for housing remain positive. If the Federal Reserve just pauses, or if the stock market doesn't swing 5% in a single day, or if inflation starts to ease, that might go a long way towards giving consumers enough confidence to get back into the market. While we wait for conditions to stabilize, we will be aggressive in managing our day-to-day business to sell homes, efficiently run our operations intelligently manage land investment and work to deliver high returns. I want to recognize our employees for their tremendous work in delivering a great third quarter. I also want to call out our teams impacted by Hurricane Ian. You have done tremendous work taking care of each other and the communities you serve. Before opening the call to questions, I want to provide a quick comment on the second press release we issued this morning. After a 30-plus year career with our company, John Chadwick, PulteGroup Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has announced his plans to retire in 2023. John has had an amazing career with our organization, and has been instrumental in its success over the years. I know, I speak for our Board and our entire company in wishing John all the best in retirement. Brandon Jones, Senior Vice President, Field Operations, has been named to replace John effective January 1, 2023, as Chief Operating Officer. Brandon began his Pulte career 18 years ago as the Director of Operations in Arizona and has held a series of field positions of increasing responsibility, including Division President, in several markets and Area President of our Southeast area. Since being named Senior Vice President of Operations in 2021, Brandon has been managing our construction operations throughout the country, so I expect the seamless transition into his new role. John will remain with the company through April of next year to assist with the changeover. We are fortunate to have a deep and talented bench within PulteGroup, and I look forward to advancing the great partnership Brandon and I have built over the years. Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Yeah, Carl. I appreciate the question this morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is we've worked through the changing market conditions over the last three to four months, early on our incentives were largely financing-related incentives, things that aimed at buying the rate down, extended rate locks, things of that nature. We felt early on that we were getting traction with consumers, especially when you could provide interest rates that were sub-5%. And in some cases, we were able to even get sub-4% with the incentives. As rates have pushed up into the 7% range, we're finding those things to be less effective. And so we've really focused the majority of our energy on pricing to what we believe current market conditions are. So price rollbacks and price drops. We have been strategic in those, Carl, but as I've talked about, we've worked to protect backlog as best we can, but we really feel it's important to continue to move inventory and to maintain the market share that we've worked so hard to get in the market. It's really those price rollbacks that we've seen get some traction over the last two to three weeks. And so we do feel while it's tough, we are encouraged with the activity that we're seeing. The one comment I would offer to that, Carl, is we have historically seen the lowest can rate out of our active adult consumer that's a buyer that's not as heavily dependent on financing. That's been consistent over the years, and the trends that we're seeing today continue to support that. Thanks Carl. Well, Stephen, let me maybe just start with saying we've got \u2013 we've got a really outstanding sales and marketing team that has always focused on the basics of working our entire lead funnel. And that hasn't changed in good market times or even these more challenging market times. So our ability to get relevant and timely messages out to our sales funnel, I'm very confident in our ability to do that. So if we're so fortunate to see rates drop. I know that, we can get the right messaging out to let folks know are \u2013 we really emphasize and push with our local sales professionals as well to maintain the relationships with our lead banks and with our interested buyers at a very local and personal level. So I think there's multiple ways using kind of the big bullhorn of the corporate marketing platform, but you've also got the grassroots local relationships with our sales professionals. Maybe just the last thing is I think the market itself, if we were so fortunate to see rates come back I think we'll probably be the greatest marketing machine of any of them. Stephen, Jim will give you the sticks and bricks, and then I'll take the second piece of the question. And then, Stephen, as to your question on our level of spec inventory, we're \u2013 we've been talking for the better part of the last two to three quarters about our desire to have more spec inventory in the system. Over the last three to four months as the market has slowed we've seen a real preference for homes that are able to deliver in the next 30 to 90 days, and that continues to this very moment. In terms of the inventory we have in our system, 35% of our leap [ph] is spec, and that is right where we want to be. So we feel very comfortable with respect to that. Looking at the finished inventory, we continue to have less than one finished home per active community, which has always been our historical benchmark. So we also feel comfortable that we're not under any pressure with finished inventory. We continue to see good flow-through of our sales rate of specs that are being sold and that are delivering in the near term, which is a real positive for us. And then maybe just the last thing, Stephen, and you've seen this transition over the last couple of years, as we've moved more of our business to the first-time entry-level product, we've intentionally put more spec inventory into those first-time entry level communities. And certainly, that's where the higher percentage of our spec inventory resides. So we feel comfortable with that. The last thing and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, as it relates to forward starts of new inventory, we've significantly slowed that, and we're matching that to what our sales rate is. So we think we've done exactly what we said we were going to do and we've made additional adjustments based on how we see market conditions at the moment. Mike, the only -- in addition to Bob's comments, I'd just highlight that as we make price adjustments, those adjustments are made to base price. And so those adjustments aren't going to necessarily show up in the incentives that Bob just described. And we've talked about it for the last several quarters as well as we're opening new communities, which there are a fair number of those. We've been very intentional in pricing to the current market such that you have -- what we believe is a more normal incentive load. And then Mike, to your margin question, yes, a lot of that will certainly be next year for homes that are on a build-to-order model. If it was a spec home, then those will show up more likely than not in the fourth quarter, and that is incorporated into the margin guide that Bob gave for the fourth quarter. Depending on kind of the nature of the adjustments we've made, some of those incentives also have flown into backlog as we work to protect the backlog and get those homes closed as well. That's also incorporated into the guide for the fourth quarter. Yeah, Matt, it was really wrapped up and I think the prior answer that I gave. As we looked at what we'll close in the fourth quarter, it incorporates specs that have been sold, some specs that still need to be sold, as well as some adjustments that flowed through the backlog based on pricing adjustments that we made in active communities. Those are the big drivers that are influencing the Q4 guide. The only other piece that I would add is there's a little bit of continued labor pressure with back-end trades, specifically the finished trades for what is still a pretty heavy load of inventory that's moving not only through our production machine, but the industry's production machine. We are starting to see some of that subside on the front end of things as starts have started to come down, and it's given us better ability to have productive conversations with front-end trades, as we work to pull costs back that are responsive to the dynamic environment that we're seeing. Yeah, Anthony, it's a fair question, and I'll go back to what I think we've talked about for years. We really look to maximize return and so we're focused on both the pace and the price kind of levers. I would tell you, we'd like to see more volume than what we're currently seeing. But as I highlighted in our prepared remarks, we're trying to be strategic and take a long-term view of that's really underpinned by what we still see as a very positive housing market. Unfortunately, we've had a doubling of interest rates in 10 months, which we've never seen in this country, at least not in the last four years. And that's coming on the heels of an unprecedented global pandemic. It's created certainly some dynamics that we're being responsive to, but we're not going to overreact. Anthony, we're \u2013 as I highlighted in maybe my previous question, we're continuing to see some back-end labor pressure with the finished trades. And then at the current environment, we haven't seen a bunch of progress with cycle times. We're still running right around six months, which is kind of unchanged from where we were in the prior quarter. I wouldn't expect to see any improvement in Q4. There's just too much production still on the machine. I am very focused with our production teams to claw back cycle time in 2023. So my hope would be by the time we hit Q2, Q3, Q4 of next year, we're starting to see some meaningful kind of quarter-over-quarter improvement as we get back to more typical cycle times. So I'm confident based on the drop in volume, but also just the healing of the supply chain, which continues to get better and better \u2013 that, that can become a reality in 2023 and beyond. Yeah, Ivy, thanks for the questions. I appreciate it. In terms of the cancellations that we're seeing, it's both. We're absolutely seeing buyers that can no longer afford, we're also seeing buyers that still can't afford, but they've gotten cold feet for whatever reasons. And in many cases, they're walking away from pretty sizable earnest money deposits that economically don't make a ton of sense, but that's where you really get into the psychology. They're just not confident in making a purchase. I'd tell you, as we look at the trends over the last couple of quarters, we haven't seen a noticeable or a significant change in the mix of reasons why folks are canceling. That's been pretty consistent. In terms of the buyer pool, Ivy, it's understandably less, and I'll specifically focus on who can afford as the industry is going through some pricing adjustments, I think we are working to get more people into that pool. The pool that's harder to quantify, and I'm not even going to attempt to guess is how many people are on the sideline because of psychological fear. Those folks just aren't engaging with us. They're waiting. And as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, I think the only way we get that buyer back into the market is through stability and those are unfortunately things that we don't directly control. So -- and we've highlighted what we think they are. Yeah, Ivy. What I'd highlight is we underwrite return, we've never underwritten the margin. And so the screen that we're using in the current environment is we're using current pace and price against the historical return on invested capital screen and risk grid that we've always used. And we have not compromised on that. The -- so the deals that we've elected to walk away from simply don't meet that screen. The ones that we've elected to move forward with, by and large, continue to meet our return-based screen and that includes margins that are all over the board in terms of the historical range that we've typically operated. And Bob, anything you'd add in terms of underwriting? So hopefully, Ivy, that helps in terms of your question. Not at all. We're continuing to move forward with it and open those communities. And in fact, some of the communities that we've recently opened have been some of our brightest and best performers, which is really encouraging. I think there's two reasons for that, John. One, these are good communities and good locations that have got great interest lists that we've been working for a long time referencing back to the marketing comment that was asked a little bit ago. We've also been very deliberate in making sure that we're pricing the current market. Now, we do that all the time when we open up new communities, but especially in light of the current environment, when we're opening, we're making sure that we're opening at a value, and we've seen traction there. So communities that are opening today have been in our pipeline for a long time. They were bought right. They were arguably developed at a pretty attractive cost basis as well. And so we can continue to deliver nice margins and more importantly, good returns out of those communities. No, Mike, we actually feel really good about our geographic footprint. We've entered into several new markets over the last three to four years, and we're as confident in those today as we were when we made the decision to go there. A lot of the places that we've entered into in recent years have been places that have had really attractive job growth and really nothing's changed along those lines. There are also places that are attractive climates. They generally tend to be more affordable places and there are locations that are predominantly in the Sunbelt. So we think our new market expansion strategy still makes a ton of sense. In terms of our existing markets, we're really happy with them. I wouldn't -- I don't know that I have any real additional color to add in terms of the geographies that are doing well versus not other than what I highlighted in my prepared remarks. The Western markets are the toughest for sure. I think that's been widely reported by -- for many sources. We're also seeing relative softness in the Northeast, some of the more expensive locales. The Southeast, Florida, Texas, relatively or performing better for a lot of the reasons that I just touched on as with my comments on expansion markets. Truman, the view that we've had on realtor commissions through time is to be balanced with it. We certainly appreciate when relators are the procuring cause or our \u2013 truly bring kind of a buyer into our sales office and help with that process. We've paid, I think, a market competitive broker commission. We're still in the same position today. So there's certainly cases here and there where you may have an above average broker commission, as an incentive to move a particular property that's got a unique set of circumstances, but broadly, you won't see us as a strategy employ above average broker commissions. I think it depends on the market and it depends on the builder. I think there are certain builders that part of their strategy \u2013 their marketing strategy is largely directed toward outsized or above average broker commissions. So as the market gets tougher, you're seeing certain competitors that use that as maybe their primary marketing tool, you're starting to see those bigger numbers come into play. Yes, Truman, it's really the \u2013 we've been talking with all of our trades, but I would tell you the more kind of recent and impactful conversations have been with the front-end trades \u2013 so underground plumbing foundation up through shell, exterior shell, those conversations have been frequent and helpful. Those are the trades that are feeling the slowdown in the industry right now. And so as they evaluate their kind of business situation and kind of the volume that they would like to be doing and what efficiencies look like. We're engaged in what I would tell you, are productive conversations. We need to pull cost out of housing generally. That's our organization, and that's our trades as well. I think we can all appreciate that we've seen unprecedented inflation, both in materials and labor. And those costs are real. And so I think we're trying to take a pragmatic but very intentful approach in how we try to pull cost out of the system. Thank you, Truman."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. There's a lot to review this quarter, so I'll dive right in. Home sale revenues for our third quarter totaled $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 16% over the same period last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven primarily by a 15% increase in our average sales price to $545,000. The year-over-year increase in average sales price of $71,000 was driven by improved pricing across all buyer groups as first time was up 20%, move-up gained 16% and active adult was up 15%. Unit closings in the quarter increased by 1% over last year to 7,047 homes. It's worth noting that approximately 200 closings that were slated for the fourth -- the third quarter were delayed due to Hurricane Ian as we shut down or slowed operations across a number of our Florida and Carolina markets ahead of the storm. On a year-over-year basis, the mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed slightly as 36% were first-time buyers, 38% were move-up buyers and 26% were active adult buyers. In the prior year, 31% of homes delivered were first-time, 44% were move-up and 25% were active adult. The shift in mix to more first time is in alignment with our strategy of having approximately one-third of our business in the first-time buyer space. Net new orders in the third quarter totaled 4,924 homes, which is a decrease of 28% from last year. The year-over-year decline in orders reflect softer demand, resulting primarily from higher interest rates as our absorption pace fell to 2.0 homes per month, down from three homes per month for the same period last year. Along with a slower pace of sales, our reported net new orders in the third quarter were impacted by a significant increase in cancellations. Our cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%, which compares with 10% in the third quarter of last year and 15% in the second quarter of this year. In the quarter, orders among first-time buyers increased 3% over the prior year as sales benefited from a double-digit increase in community count and the availability of quick move-in homes as the majority of our spec production is in our Centex communities. Orders for move-up buyers were lower by 45% than the prior year, while active adult orders decreased by 31%. Changes in community accounts did not materially impact -- did not materially impact order rates among either of these buyer groups. During the quarter, we operated from an average of 823 communities, which is up 7% from last year. The increase in community count is consistent with our previous guidance and reflects both new store openings and the slower closeout of existing communities. Average community count for the fourth quarter should increase slightly to 840. At quarter end, our backlog totaled 17,053 homes, which is down 14% from the same period last year. While unit backlog is lower, the dollar value of our backlog increased 3% over the prior year to $10.6 billion due to the rise in our average sales prices. We ended the third quarter with a total of 23,010 homes under construction, which is up 22% over last year. Of the units under construction, 65% were sold and 35% were spec. Consistent with comments made on prior earnings calls; we've been working to increase our inventory of spec homes primarily in our Centex communities to better serve first-time buyers. We continued start expects in the third quarter as we have continued to see buyer preference for homes that can close in 30 to 90 days across all buyer groups. At quarter end, we were still well below our commonly used metric of one finished spec per community. However, with 8,000 specs in production, we believe we are well positioned to meet demand and to compete effectively in our markets. Having achieved our targeted level of spec within our production universe, we have now lowered our spec starts and we'll manage our production to maintain the balance of our spec and dirt inventories, with an emphasis on build-to-order production for move-up and active adult consumers. Based on the homes we have in production and current sales rates, we now expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. The decrease in expected deliveries relative to our prior guide reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on our Florida operations. To the last point, while damaged to faulty communities in Florida and the Carolinas was limited, municipal resources are appropriately being diverted to the repair and restoration of services at the expense of getting power to new homes and communities. Based on the mix of homes we expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the average sales price on closings to be in the range of $560,000 to $570,000. At the midpoint of our range, this would be up 15% over last year. Please note that, all of the guidance we provide on this call, including ASP, reflects our current best estimate, but cancellation rates and pricing dynamics as we move through the quarter could impact our actual results. For the third quarter, our homebuilding gross margin was 30.1%, which represents an increase of 360 basis points over the third quarter last year. Referring back to Ryan's opening comments, our third quarter gross margins benefited from the strong demand and pricing conditions that existed at the end of 2021 and into the first half of 2022. These conditions supported the double-digit price increases we show in the quarter and allowed us to cover higher material and labor costs, including elevated lumber prices. The strength of demand in that period can also be seen in our sales discounts, which were only 1% for homes closed in the third quarter. By contrast, discounts on new orders taken in the quarter increased 180 basis points over last year to 2.5%. It's worth noting that, this increase in discounts is in addition to the higher financing incentives we've discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Financing incentives on new orders in the third quarter were 1.9%, which is approximately 80 basis points above last year and our historic average. Given the demand and pricing dynamics we are currently experiencing in the market, in addition to the increase in incentives needed to attract sales, we currently expect our fourth quarter homebuilding gross margin to be approximately 28%. This would represent an increase of 120 basis points over last year, but would be lower sequentially and is down from our previous guide. Given the changing market dynamics, our procurement teams are already having discussions with suppliers and trade partners in an effort to identify opportunities to reduce our land development and house construction costs. However, at this point, any savings we are able to realize would benefit our business in 2023. In the third quarter, our SG&A expense was $350 million or 9.1% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $321 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. The company remains on track for full year SG&A to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5%. Given the pullback in buyer demand and expectations that market dynamics will remain challenging for summer all of 2023, we are taking needed actions to better align overheads with current demand. For the third quarter, higher gross margin and greater overhead leverage helped PulteGroup generate an operating margin of 21%, which represents an increase of 410 basis points over the prior year. Turning to financial services. Our operations continue to face extremely challenging market conditions. In the third quarter, our reported pre-tax income totaled $28 million, which is down from $49 million last year. In the quarter, lower loan origination volumes driven in part by a lower capture rate and decreased profitability per loan were the primary drivers of the decline in pre-tax income. Capture rate for the quarter was 77% compared with 85% last year as our mortgage business seeks to be competitive but not to chase unprofitable business. Our tax expense for the third quarter was $183 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 22.6%. Our taxes in the third quarter include federal energy-efficient home credits, which were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted into law in August of this year. In total, PulteGroup's reported net income for the third quarter increased to $628 million or $2.69 per share. The company's prior year net income was $476 million or $1.82 per share. In the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase activity, buying 4.4 million shares or another 2% of our outstanding common shares for $180 million or an average price of $41.20 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we have repurchased approximately 9% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of the year for $975 million. Along with buying back stock, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the quarter, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets. As Ryan discussed, in response to changing market conditions, we are re-underwriting every land transaction based on current price, pace and cost dynamics. We ended the third quarter with approximately 232,000 lots under control, which is down 11,600 lots from the end of the second quarter of this year due in large part to the deals we elected to terminate. At quarter end, 50% of our total land pipeline was controlled via option and we continue to work toward our long-term goal of getting to 65% to 70%. While we have terminated a number of transactions, there are land positions that we have under control that we still project to achieve or exceed our required rates of return. As a result, we currently expect to close on such transactions and expect our result in full year land investment to be approximately $4.8 billion, which is in line with our prior guide. Given the change in buyer demand and the resulting impact on the turning of our own land inventory, we currently expect that our land spend will drop materially next year. While we are still in the planning process, our preliminary estimate is that land acquisition and development spend in 2023 will drop by $1.5 billion to approximately $3.3 billion. Of this spend, we expect that upwards of two-thirds will be for the development of existing land assets. We will provide more details on next year's planned land acquisition and development spend during our Q4 earnings call. We ended the quarter with $291 million in cash and had $319 million drawn on our revolving credit facility. Our drawings under the revolving credit facility were driven primarily by our land acquisition and development spend, an increase in our house inventories as we move homes through production and the delay in closings related to Hurricane Ian. Our debt-to-capital ratio at quarter end was 22.5%. Wrapping up the higher interest rates being orchestrated by the Federal Reserve are achieving the Fed's objective in terms of slowing demand and negatively impacting price appreciation in the market. While conditions have gotten tougher, I am confident in PulteGroup's competitive position and in our ability to successfully work through this phase of the housing cycle. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yeah. We typically don't give that level of detail, Carl. What we have seen with cans is a little bit of a change versus where we were three months ago, we were seeing churn in the 30 to 60 days. What we have seen is a little bit more cancellation for folks that have been in backlog a little bit longer, and it's that rapid and substantial rate increase from when they signed. So at the end of the day, I think -- I don't think that we're surprised by that, but we have seen a little bit of movement from people that have been in backlog a little bit longer. Yeah. So in the most recently printed quarter today, third quarter, our incentive load was 1% on closing. And that is a little bit better than last year, 30 basis points better than closings during the third quarter of last year. What we did highlight was on the sales in this quarter, so not the closings, but the sales that rate ran up to about 2.5%. So running higher and also that financing incentives, and we talked about this in the second quarter, we're up over sales in the third quarter of last year, so that the total load of incentive is up on current sales, by a couple of hundred basis points versus the closings that we had in this quarter. So then that will influence our business over that couple of quarters as those homes close. Yeah, Mike, it's \u2013 there's so much detail behind that, where \u2013 what the price points are. You can see, though, our sign-up \u2013 average price for sign-ups is down by about 6%. That certainly reflects some of the current pricing. You have to be a little bit careful because our sign-ups were a little bit more skewed towards first time, and so mix matters in that. So I wouldn't want to put a number on x percent down, because it really varies by market, by community. But again, you can see that ASP is likely to come down and there will be some margin consequence. And you can see it in the guide that we gave, where we at 28%. Yeah. Without getting into the detail month by month, I think you heard it in Ryan's prepared comments. The demand equation followed the rate movements. And so you saw a little bit of a dip in rates in August. We saw some activity around that, where people came off the fence as rates progressed higher after that, we saw a relative decrease in demand. Yeah. It's interesting. The market will tell us that. I don't want to predict. We've got obviously call it, $400 million, $450 million of total money at risk around option deals. So that's going to be pre-acquisition spend, legal, et cetera, as well as deposits. You heard us say and we've been doing this for a while now, we're reevaluating every land transaction. And it's interesting because we made the point in the prepared remarks we have been closing on a lot of transactions. And our expectation is that we will for the balance of the year, there will be some stuff that we walk away from. I wouldn't want to try and quantify it. But part of the reason our land spend is projected to go down next year is because it's getting harder to make stuff work, especially in things that were negotiated more recently. So as that stuff comes to the table, I think we're going to have some questions to answer internally as to whether it still meets our return requirements. The good news is, and again, it was in Ryan's prepared remarks, the 11,600 lots that we walked away from had a land act spend of $800 million. And if we had bought all that land at a point in time, that might have been some tough markets that we would have had to work through. So we feel -- and Ryan said it, we don't feel good about a $24 million charge. Having said that, having to work through $800 million of land with, oh, by the way, a lot of development spend on top of that. So we feel like it's actually operating the way we are as we look at the market, we're trying to get more of that optionality into our book. We've targeted 65% to 70%. We're pushing our teams to look for optionality, whether it be in time or take down. So I think -- I don't want to guess at what the market is going to bring to us. We'll work through each transaction as we go. Yeah. We'll go through the same exact exercise we always have. It's interesting we highlighted in this call. We are out on our revolver, which is \u2013 we started borrowing a little bit last quarter. We're actually out on the line today first and foremost, we'll pay that off. Our expectation is that we'll be able to do that in short order. Then what we always do is look at what the next several years. So it's not a point in time, capital generation and usages and we'll consider investment in land. We've highlighted that we think spend is going to be down, we'll be building and monetizing our backlog. So we think we're going to be cash flow positive. And so we'll look at the capital base that we've got and what to do. And we'll have choices. We can \u2013 we will obviously continue our dividend. We can look at share repurchases. We will also be looking at our leverage. Obviously, the run-up in rates makes our debt a little more attractive on a pricing basis. Not suggesting, we're going to do anything, but it's \u2013 and we look at these things consistently through time, and we'll consider all those things. But I think you can \u2013 should expect to see us in market for equity, and we'll look at any other use of cash at the same time. Looking. I don't -- we're going to have to get back to you on that. What I could tell you is that it is again, running at a consistent percentage. We haven't seen a run up in the percentage of people who just don't outright qualify or rejections. So -- but what the relative percentage of that is, I don't know off the top of my head."

Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Thank you, Jim Zeumer, you may begin.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Chris and good morning. I appreciate everyone joining today to review -- our PulteGroup conference call to review our second quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2022. Joining me to discuss PulteGroup's strong second quarter are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President of Finance. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the presentation slides had accompanied today's call have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll also post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to highlight that in addition to reviewing our reported Q2 results, we will also be reviewing adjusted results for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted results exclude the impact of a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit, as well as a tax benefit of $12 million resulting from a change in valuation allowances associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. As always, I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Ryan, Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of exceptional and in many cases record setting financial results. Led by price appreciation and a 430 basis point expansion in gross margin, our second quarter earnings of $2.73 per share increased by 44% and 59% respectively over last year's reported and adjusted earnings per share. Our strong earnings performance helped to further reduce our debt-to-capital ratio to below 21% while raising our return on equity for the trailing 12 months to north of 30%. We've talked in the past about wanting to deliver high returns over the housing cycle and building the financial strength to safely navigate changing market conditions. I'm proud to say that we're accomplishing both. I would also note that consistent with our stated plans, we continue to return funds to shareholders having repurchased an additional 3% of our shares during the quarter. As we approach the 10 year anniversary of reinstating our share repurchase program, I think it's worth noting that we have reduced our share count from roughly 387 million shares at the end of 2012 to the current 233 million shares, a decrease of almost 40%. Bob will detail the rest of the quarterly numbers. So let me spend some time reviewing the demand dynamics we experienced during the quarter. Between National Housing Data and Wall Street analysts surveys, I suspect my comments may only serve to reaffirm your understanding of the changing market conditions. It is clear that the 200 basis point increase in interest rates over the past several months finally caught up with consumers. After two years of meaningful home price appreciation, the jump in mortgage rates created sticker shock and pushed affordability out of reach for some first-time buyers. At the same time rising inflation, falling consumer confidence and the drumbeat of a possible recession caused some buyers, some move-up buyers to hit the pause button. As for our active adult consumers, the drop in the stock market combined with the overall uncertainty has created some to slow their home search process as they wait for conditions to settle down. While demand has slowed, it is by no means stopped as we continue to work with buyers to sell homes at the right price where consumers see value, they remain engaged in the home buying process. Consumers who are in the market right now were obviously accepting of and making decisions based on current mortgage rates. What we are experiencing with these customers is that given the volatility in mortgage rates, a higher percentage of these buyers are interested in spec homes that can close in the coming 30 to 60 or even 90 days, rather than building to order. Given the shorter time to close, buyers are using their own funds or available incentives to lock in a mortgage rate or buy the rate down to an acceptable level. In other words, during this period of rate volatility, some buyers are willing to trade the opportunity to personalize the home for greater financial certainty. Reinforcing this point, I can tell you that the majority of incentives in the second quarter took the form of longer-term rate locks or rate buydowns. Many of today's homebuyers can still afford the price of a new home. But some need a little help on the rate or want the mortgage rate certainty for a home that will close later in the year. After 18 months of exceptional demand, we entered the second quarter with only 64 finished specs. And while we have successfully increased spec production to our historic range of 25% to 30% of units, we had a limited supply of quick move in homes available. We have taken actions to improve our inventory position and now have specs that have advanced in the build process and will be available to sell and close in the third and fourth quarters of this year. During this period of interest rate volatility, our strategy is to start specs consistent with buyer demand. As market conditions evolve, we are prepared to continue starting specs, reemphasize build-to-order homes or slow starts entirely as demand conditions warrant. The Fed has been clear in articulating their intention to fight inflation through higher rates and we recognize the housing market has been and will continue to be impacted by these actions. Well, consumers are being understandably cautious, people still desire homeownership. Aging Millennials still need homes and there remains a long-term deficit in U.S. housing stock after years of under building. Let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results, Bob?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Following on Ryan's comments, our second quarter financial results demonstrate both the continuation of positive trends as well as some of the newer challenges which are impacting the market. In the second quarter, PulteGroup's home sale revenues totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of 18% over the prior-year. Higher homebuilding revenues in the second quarter were driven by a 19% or $83,000 increase in average sales price to $531,000. Given our construction cycle times, the increase in average selling prices primarily reflects strong demand and pricing conditions across all buyer groups in the back half of last year. In the quarter, we closed 7,177 homes, which is down less than 1% from last year and a few units below our guide. While the overall production environment remains generally challenging, the shortfall in deliveries is primarily attributable to a specific supplier issue that impacted our Florida markets. More broadly, I think it's fair to say that the supply chain remains challenging. While we are seeing areas of improvement, I would use the word fragile to describe overall conditions. Between limited inventory in the system and bottlenecks in distribution, any disruption in production or shipping can set back construction by a couple of days or weeks. In fact during the second quarter, our overall cycle times extended by another two weeks. That being said, we are feeling a little more optimistic about supply chain conditions getting better through the back half of the year, allowing us to begin playing back workdays next year. The mix of deliveries in the second quarter continued to align with our started targets with 35% from first-time buyers, 39% for move-up buyers, and 26% from active adult buyers. In the second quarter last year, the mix was 30% first-time, 43% move-up and 27% active adult. We reported 6,418 net new orders in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 23% from the second quarter of last year. The decrease in orders reflects both slower sales pace, and higher cancellations resulting from the significant increase in mortgage rates over the past several months. The slowdown in signups impacted all buyer groups. Although our first-time buyers fared the best with orders up 1% to 2,454 homes. Move up orders were lower by 37% to 2,172 homes and active adult orders decreased 27% to 1,792 homes. On a relative basis, the stronger orders among first-time buyers reflects current buyer preference for spec homes that can close sooner with that less interest rate risk. By design, our spec production has been heavily weighted toward our first-time communities. Our reported orders for the quarter also reflects an increase in cancellations as some consumers were impacted by the change in consumer confidence and today's higher rates. On a unit basis, we had 1,152 contracts cancelled in the second quarter up from 665 cancellations last year. This pushed up our cancellation rate for the period to 15% compared with 7% last year. We always want our homebuyers to complete the transaction and enjoy their new Pulte Home, but when cancellations do occur, we have been able to resell the home. In the second quarter we operated from an average of 791 communities, which is a decrease of 2% from an average of 808 communities last year. After several quarters operating at a year-over-year deficit on communities Q2 ship market and flagship point, as we begin showing growth in our year-over-year community counts. More specifically, in the third and fourth quarters we expect to operate from an average of 800 and 830 communities respectively. Both numbers would be up over the comparable prior year period as we begin realizing the impact of increased land investment over the last several years. We ended the quarter with a backlog of 19,176 homes, which is down 4% from last year. While units are down slightly strong price appreciation over the past year has raised our backlog value by 18% to a record of $11.6 billion. At quarter end we had 23,349 homes under construction, which is an increase of 35% over last year. Consistent with Ryan's earlier comments about buyers seeking to minimize time to close, we have increased spec starts and ended the quarter with 6,789 spec units under production. While we have been successful in increasing the overall number of homes under construction, longer cycle times mean that 70% of these units are at the start or framing stage. As such, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,000 to 7,400 homes. While we have the homes in production, given changing market conditions and ongoing supply chain issues, we now expect full-year deliveries to be in the range of 30,000 to 31,000 homes. Based on the anticipated mix of closings. We expect the average closing price of homes in the third quarter and for the full-year to be in the range of 540,000 to $550,000. Supported by a strong price appreciation we have realized over the past few quarters, PulteGroup generated substantial gains in our home building gross margin, which increased 430 basis points over last year to 30.9%. In addition to higher prices, our Q2 gross margins reflects the flow through of lower cost lumber purchased in the back half of last year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we've experienced meaningful cost inflation for labor and materials in the current year, led by a significant upswing in lumber cost at the start of this year. Although lumber has decreased again, which will impact our 2023 closings, we've continued to experience incremental house cost inflation as the year has progressed. Based on our most recent internal estimates, we now expect house costs for the year to be up 10% to 12% over last year. Despite the ongoing inflation in materials and labor, including the meaningfully higher lumber costs, we are raising our margin guide for the third quarter and now expect to realize gross margins of approximately 30%. At the present time, we are maintaining our prior guide for fourth quarter gross margins to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%. In the second quarter SG&A expense totaled $351 million, or 9.2% of home sale revenues. In the prior year period our recorded SG&A expense of $272 million, or 8.4% of home sale revenues included a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in that period. Excluding that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense in the second quarter last year was $390 million, or 9.8% of home sale revenues. Based on the number of homes we expect to close in the third and fourth quarters, we are targeting SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9.1% to 9.3% of homebuilding revenues. At the midpoint, this would be a roughly 40 basis point improvement over last year. For the full-year we still anticipate SG&A expense to be 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $40 million in the second quarter, which is down from $51 million in the same period last year. The decrease in pre-tax income reflects the extremely competitive market conditions that continue to pressure profitability and capture rate in the business. In the quarter, our capture rate was 78%, down from 86% last year, as we are unwilling to chase market pricing down to unprofitable levels. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $212 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5%. In the second quarter of last year, our reported tax expense of $136 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.3% included a tax benefit of $12 million, and the benefit of federal energy efficient home credits, which expired as of December 31 last year. Looking at the bottom-line, PulteGroup's reported net income for the second quarter was $652 million, or $2.73 per share. In the prior year, our reported net income was $503 million, or $1.90 per share with adjusted net income for the period of $456 million, or $1.72 per share. In the second quarter, the company continued its active share repurchase program buying back 7.1 million shares for $294 million, or an average price of $41.44 per share. Through the first six months of the year, we have repurchased 17.4 million shares, or 7% of our shares outstanding for $794 million. Throughout the past 10 years, we have taken a fairly systematic approach to our share repurchases. We plan to maintain a routine presence in the market, but given ongoing stock market volatility, we will incorporate more of an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. Over the near term, we believe this strategy allows us to be more responsive to changing market conditions. We ended the quarter with $732 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 20.8%. We continue to see value and the potential to achieve appropriate risk adjusted returns in many of the land assets we put under control over the last couple of years. As such, we invested $470 million in outright land acquisition during the quarter and invested another $655 million in the development of existing land assets, bringing our total land investment for the second quarter to $1.1 billion. We remain constructive on long-term housing demand, but we appreciate that market conditions are in flux. While we always maintain a disciplined approach to land investment, we are assessing the land positions we have under control to make sure that the underwriting assumptions supporting our investment reflect current market conditions, and that the projected returns still achieve our required return thresholds. At this time, we still expect to invest between $4.5 billion and $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the year with more than half of this spend allocated to developing existing land assets. Given today's changing market dynamics, the optionality of our land book becomes an even more important tool for potentially enhancing returns and controlling risks. We ended the second quarter with 243,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options. And as we highlighted on our last earnings call, we are assessing ways to meaningfully increase our option lot position to a target range of 65%, 70% of our lots under control. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: The more challenging demand conditions that developed in the quarter have continued through the month of July as the significant increase in mortgage rates has impacted consumers throughout the country. While all consumers are impacted by higher rates, we are seeing differences across our markets. Lower priced markets in places like Florida, Texas, and the Southeast areas of ongoing high end migration are holding up better. Higher priced markets are those which have realized outsized price appreciation in recent years have incurred a more meaningful slowdown and demand. In tech hubs like Austin or in our Western markets in California and Washington were prices routinely approach or exceed a million dollars. Sales bases have slowed as buyers struggle with the combination of elevated prices and increased mortgage rates. Housing is clearly in the sights of the Federal Reserve and its fight against inflation that the Fed desires depending upon the community. Home price appreciation has slowed, stopped or through the use of incentives is taking a couple of steps back. Through much of the second quarter, incentives were mostly tied to the mortgage, but this is now expanding to include discounts and options and lot premiums. In the end these are variations on a path toward lower price, which is what the Fed needs to see as it assesses when they have moved rates high enough. While we are still early in this process, we are starting to see some impact on the cost side commodities like lumber, copper, and aluminum have rollover. The fallen lumber prices alone could save us upwards of $10,000 per home beginning in 2023. And while land prices are notoriously slow to adjust, deals are getting cancelled and/or renegotiated. We walked away from a handful of deals in the second quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are reassessing all of the land transactions we currently have under control, given ongoing changes in housing demand dynamics. We remain constructive on the long-term outlook for housing demand. But right now, higher mortgage rates were having an impact. We have to work harder to sell homes. We have to be more nimble in the market to make sure we have the right product available. We have to be responsive to changes in the competitive landscape. This is how homebuilding typically operates. And I am extremely confident in PulteGroup's ability to compete. I would highlight that we operate from a position of strength with an outstanding balance sheet, a strong land pipeline, unmatched product quality, and most importantly, experienced and talented people throughout our organization. So let me end by thanking our entire team for their hard work and commitment.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time in this call. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up. Thank you. And Chris, if you would open the lines, we'll get started with Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. First one just on the buyer segments, clearly a wide difference there between first-time buyers, move-up and active adult, just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there, clearly with first-time buyers, sort of by definition, potentially more financially constrained into this environment. And as you mentioned, more impacted by the move in rates. And yet you have this significant difference between the Buyer segments. So could you sort of just elaborate a little on what you think is going on there? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Matt. Good morning, it's Ryan. The biggest thing I'd highlight here is the availability of quick move in homes in the first-time buyer segment, what we've seen with all buyers is that there's a real preference toward having a home that can deliver in the near-term. I think the uncertainty around supply chain delays and some of those things have certainly proved to be more predictable and better. But the biggest thing is just this the certainty of being able to lock in the interest rate without a whole bunch of incremental rate lock points, and then they've been able to use incentives to buy down the current rate to something that they can make work from a overall affordability standpoint. So I think that's the biggest difference. As we highlighted in some of our prepared remarks, each of the buyer segments or the consumer groups we target have been impacted in the current environment for different reasons. But it's really the availability and quick movements that allowed the first-time segment to outperform.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it, thank you for that, Ryan. And then second one on the incentives. I think I heard you say at the end, what was initially more related to or the initial incentives being more related to rate buy downs and such now sort of progressing into option and lock premiums coming down. I guess number one, apologies if I didn't hear you, but if you could actually put some numbers or quantify that statement. And number two just as these incentives has progressed, are you actually starting to see any elasticity there? Are you actually starting to see some buyers sort of react positively to those changes in incentives? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, so it's a good question. Let me maybe start first with the incentive load that we saw with signups. And this is actually new contracts that we wrote in the second quarter. They were in the range of about 2%, which is still below probably what we would consider to be a normal range of 2% to 3% if you went back to pre-COVID timeframes, and that includes all incentives. So incentives on options, mortgage rate type incentives, financing incentives, et cetera. It gets a little harder to quantify the change in lot premiums, because we're always repricing and always re-leasing new lot option or a lot premium pricing as we release new phases. So that becomes a little bit more subjective. But what we highlighted is accurate. We are starting to see not only in our own business, but in the competitive set, some additional incentives that are starting to go beyond just financing related incentives.\nMatthew Bouley: All right, much appreciated. Thank you very much.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on your build-to-rent strategy, I believe there have been about 1,400 lots approved through the strategic relationship and I think first closings in '23, you all put out initial kind of five year plan, I'm just trying to understand whether those targets are still good. And really whether you've seen any shift and appetite from any of the build-to-rent operators or your partner in particular?\nRyan Marshall: Truman, good morning, we're right on target with our kind of five year run of 7,500 units in terms of kind of moving through that in a very programmatic way. So we feel very good about how the partnership is working and the progress that we're making. We've not changed any targets to this point. And candidly based on our performance and discussions with our partner, if anything, I would tell you maybe the appetite could potentially slightly increase as we go into maybe some choppier time. So, no updates from us yet. We like the way the partnership is working, and we plan to continue kind of moving down the path.\nTruman Patterson: Okay, okay. Thanks for that. And then you all mentioned your -- to an extent updated land strategy. But have you all started to rework any of the option deals now that demand has softened? And are you making any changes to that strategy to get to the targeted 65% to 70% option land, I'm thinking, are you attempting to walk down the number of owned lots extend the takedown timeline of some of the option deals, et cetera?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Truman, it's a fair question. In terms of strategically, no, we are not changing where we have been for what is essentially a decade now. We still desire optionality, we still start with individual sellers. What we've offered is that in order to get from where we are today 54% in this most recent print to 65% and 70%, we're likely to be looking at more institutional type relationships. That process is underway, we'll give you updates as we make as transactions occur there, we still think that we can move up from 55% into that 65% to 70% range, take a little bit of time. But in terms of how we're approaching it, not at all, in terms of your question, as it relates to our current attitude and negotiating stance, we've said in the prepared remarks, we've always been, I believe pretty disciplined in how we evaluate our land position and negotiate transactions. That hasn't changed and maybe it's even been heightened. We are taking a close look at everything we are closing on. So as an example, if we put a contract, a parcel under control 18 months ago, that was waiting final entitlements, before we take that down, we are revisiting the underwriting that we had when we approve the transaction to make sure that the absorptions and the pricing and our cost structure because vertical construction costs are up, horizontal development costs are up. So we're looking at it holistically does this transaction makes sense? I will tell you, we have walked away from a couple of transactions where for a number of reasons we just didn't think it made sense whether it was locational or economic, we are also trying to make sure that the timing of takedowns makes sense. And so we have had discussions with sellers that said, hey, our original takedown structure was A, B, and C, and we'd like it to be A, D and E now. I think the sellers, I haven't seen a change in value propositions out there. But the ability to work with time is something that does, and we have taken into account. So long story short, hopefully this is really just continuing to be disciplined in the land buying process. And in a choppy market, yes, you're going to see time become more important to us and in some cases, dollars. So we'll proceed further.\nTruman Patterson: Perfect, thank you guys.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Truman.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much guys. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the comments you made with respect to market conditions. In particular, I wanted to ask about your assessment of the alternatives that your customers are evaluating. You mentioned that there's a preference respects, they can move into quickly, you said that they're remaining engaged. We know there's not a lot of standing inventory out in the marketplace, either on the new or existing. And we've also begun to hear that some of the other larger public builders have slowed their role a little bit on production. And so bottom line question is, are you seeing that your customers are finding alternatives out in the market or you continuing to find that they are remaining on your interest list and things of that nature? And have you seen anything specific in terms of your competition doing anything particularly disruptive with respect to their production? In other words, have they -- have you seen an increase in production activity? Or have you actually seen the opposite?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, good morning. There was a lot there. So let me see if I can unpack it one at a time, in terms of our competition, we've actually seen competition pull back slightly in terms of the amount of inventory production that they're putting into the market. And that's specifically for some of our competitors that I think are predominantly spec builders. We haven't seen anything that's been irrational, or widespread, irrational disruptive type behavior, when it comes to incentive, or price drops or things of that nature. Of course, there's the anecdotal builder in a specific market, in a specific submarket that might have a unique or particular challenge that they're working against, but we haven't seen anything that that we would highlight at a national level. In terms of the choices and the opportunities that buyers have, I think it's still the market to find homes that are in the right place at the right price, with the timing that matches up to what buyers want. And more than anything, Stephen, what we've tried to kind of highlight. And Bob and I were just out in the market a couple of weeks ago and we were in multiple sales offices in multiple different cities over the course of two or three days. And spec inventory is definitely preferred. And I think it's all about the financial certainty that a buyer can get by being able to lock in the rate without paying a whole bunch of extra discount points, which you have to pay for a longer-term rate lock, or they're able to take the current market rate and put some incentive dollars against that and buy it down, or do a five year arm or a seven year arm or something of that nature. So I think, what we're seeing with buyers, if they can find the home that meets their needs, and they're able to get certainty around the financing. We're seeing buyers move forward. As part of the reason that we highlighted in our prepared remarks that buyers are remaining engaged in the process. We've been very successful in getting our backlog across the finish line for the most part. As we've looked at the reason for cancellations, they're vary like they always have been. There's not surprisingly been a disproportionate change in financing. So we're still able to get buyers across the finish line and qualified in the cases where buyers are canceling. We've been successful in getting those homes resold pretty quickly. So it's a choppy market out there, Stephen. I think we're doing some really nice things, we continue to emphasize quality of the homes that we're building and customer service, buying land in the right locations. And I think over the long-term in a broad housing environment that we're very constructive on. We think over the next year two, three years, we've positioned ourselves to be very successful with our overall strategy.\nStephen Kim: Great. That's really helpful. I mean, particularly your comment about the certainty versus the qualifications. It sounds like for a lot of buyers, it's not math, it's mental. And that's encouraging. I wanted to follow-up regarding your commentary about incentives -- excuse me, still being lower than normal. I think you said 2% on new contracts versus normal is as much as three. And that people are preferring these rate lock, or these buy downs. A couple of things, one, we had heard that rate buy downs have gotten even cheaper that used to be typical 4:1 ratio. And now we've heard ratios as low as like 2.5:1. So I was wondering if you can comment on that, whether that's been benefiting you? And then secondarily, we were -- it was interesting to see that your order price actually was quite strong, again, despite a pretty heavy mix of entry level buyers. And so I'm curious if you could comment on that. Did you actually see order price increase in all three segments or exactly what was going on there that drove the very nice growth in order price this quarter?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll let Bob, give you some details on the order pricing. In terms of kind of incentives that are out there, I think all are speaking for ourselves, but I think our competitive set as well. I think we've been, we've worked to be smart in finding kind of where the market is, and what will move the needle for buyers. You mentioned that just a second ago, I think as much as anything, this is mental versus price. And so we've been cautious not just to cut the bottom of the market out from underneath, what I think we've all work so hard to achieve, because that may not ultimately move the fear that's out there in the minds of a lot of buyers, specifically our move up in our active adult buyers. As far as rate buy downs. I'll let Bob, maybe comment on the ratio, we do have currently advertised on our national website, a 4.25% interest rate, which is on a seven year arm or a seven six arm as I think they're now doing. But we think there, we think there are solutions out there, providers that are ready to move forward. And we're not having to completely give away the farm in order to define some of those interest rates that I think are more like what we saw 90 days ago. Bob, do you want to touch on his question on the pricing?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it's interesting, if you look at our ASP in the most recent print, were up 19% the highest kind of growth of ASP is in the first time space, which was up 24% move up and active adult were up about 20%. And so the 19% growth for the company is mix adjusted, right? If you look at our backlog, what we've seen is to answer your question, pricing up across all three. So our backlog ASPs are higher for all three of our key demographics first time move up and activate bill.\nStephen Kim: Bob was that sequential? Is that a sequential comment or it just yours?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: That is versus the first quarter of this year.\nStephen Kim: Great.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: And interestingly, the highest increase on a relative basis among those is the move up. Now mix matters and all that, but that move up buyer space is probably the biggest contributor to that increase.\nStephen Kim: Okay, thank you so much.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There's still a lot to dig in on here. Ryan, Bob, I know typically you don't give things like monthly trends, but just in light of this being such a unique and quickly changing environment. Wondering if you could quantify your order trends by month and give us a little more quantification on how July is tracking?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, I think we're going to stick with our previous kind of practice and not get into the monthly detail. I will tell you that we did see a decline as we move through the quarter. April, was still relatively strong, May slowed, and then June slowed again, specifically, after the 75 basis point increase that we saw from the Fed last month. We saw a big change in June. And then that's really kind of continued through July. We have seen an uptick in cans, as we've moved kind of through the period as well. I think, again, all kind of related and tied to the kind of buyer's remorse and the fear of maybe potentially buying at the top of the market, as we potentially go into a recessionary type environment. I think that's weighed heavily on buyers. So we're still, I'll just, I'll leave it at that Mike.\nMichael Dahl: Okay, maybe just quick kind of part two, before I ask the second question. Just if July is still tracking similar, I don't know, if it's similar or worse than June. We have effectively retraced that entire last 75 basis point move up in rate. So just it doesn't seem like we've seen an order trends improve really across the group based on your comments specifically. So wondering if you can kind of reconcile that? But my second question is around land and following-up on some prior questions and your comments around managing strategy and you've always been disciplined. If we look on a forward basis, based on where you're kind of tracking on orders, your lock position might end up at call it like nine to 10 years, if we were using orders as the denominator, which is obviously quite elevated. So how are you thinking about incremental acquisition dollars, or as I think Truman may have asked paring back your own land position more aggressively looking out?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, I appreciate the question on land. Let me just I'll finish your question about kind of what we've seen from buyers as rates have pulled back over the last call it three to four weeks a little bit. So I think that's certainly been helpful. We have seen a slight up tick in our ability to sell and get new deals done, as I think buyers have kind of come to terms with the current environment. But when you combined the higher rates, along with I think the overhang of low consumer confidence, some combination, it's pretty volatile cocktail that I think we're all dealing with and helping the consumer to make what is the single biggest purchase of their lives. So, there's a lot wrapped up in there, we're going to continue to focus on a lot of the basics, we're going to continue to focus on making sure that our community execution is great that we've got the right product that we've got, that were priced competitively, we're not going to find ourselves in a position where we're giving up market share because we're being too margin proud. We're very -- we're obviously very happy with the work that we've done on the margin side. But I do want the investment community and our investors to know that we're going to continue to be very market competitive. Moving to the land side. Mike, there's a couple of things here that I'd highlight. Number one, we continue to be very focused on through cycle investment, and delivering high return on invested capital. So the way that we have allocated capital, the amount of land that we've put under control, the way that we have structured our purchase transactions has all been toward maximizing return, I think we've done an unbelievable job there. As we move into this period of time where demand is clearly slowing, and we've got lower new orders to your point, you could end up with more years owned or more years controlled than what you realistically probably need. We think that's the beauty of the option strategy that we have undertaken over the last number of years. And so we've got two potential options, yes, you can work to trim the owned land position, but you can certainly also trim the option land percentage as well, or as Bob highlighted, we've got the opportunity to renegotiate some of that on time. So, this is a business where you clearly need forward land, we like what we have under control, but we're not blindly rushing into every contract without given everything a second, third and a fourth look to make sure that it still makes sense, based on current market conditions, but also based on our overall land pipeline, and what we think we need to run a profitable high returning business in the future. Bob, anything else you'd add on land or land pipeline?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, maybe the only thing I'd add, if you look at our owned lot position, we own 113,000 lots three months ago, that was 112,000. So despite the investments that we've made in the current quarter as an example, it's not like we're bulking up the owned position. To Ryan's point, we've got flexibility with the option, if you look at our quarterly growth in the balance sheet as an example, we put a lot of money on the balance sheet in this quarter, the majority of that was house, which is going to be quick turning for us. So we put $800 plus million into inventory in the quarter, which is reflective of that $1.1 billion that we spent on land and development. But again, a lot of that is house and it's the cycle time extension that we've talked about. And so we'll get that money back pretty quickly. So hear you loud and clear. We have the ability to influence what our owned lot position looks like, based on the strength of the book we have today.\nMichael Dahl: All right. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Bob. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: The next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Your line is open.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for commentary and information so far. Bob, maybe on that last point, just talking about the inventory build and primarily the whip build there. I just wanted to clarify your start pay strategy at this point. Ryan, I think your message is loud and clear that you guys are seeing relatively stronger demand on homes that are closer to delivery, which I think makes a lot of sense. At the same time as bill cycles where they are, you guys do kind of need to make a decision on where you potentially see demand going over the next six, nine, 12 months. So have you actually been maintaining that pace of spec starts assuming that that's where the demand will continue going forward or have you started to dial that back a bit from where you were earlier in the year?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, the pace of spec starts has been dialed back from where we were in the first part of the year, no question, because we've seen -- we've seen demand subside or pullback for to be built, as well as specs. But on a relative basis, there is more ability to get buyers across the finish line, when we've got homes that are within kind of a 30 to 90 day delivery window. So, proportionately we're starting more specs relative to sales compared to historical norms. That's a mouthful there. So on an absolute basis, it's less across the board. On a relative basis, we're doing more specs compared to dirt sales, when you think about historical norms. So, Alan, I think the best way I can describe is we got one foot on the gas and we got one foot on the brake. We are managing this very aggressively. We want to have inventory that is available. The last thing we want to do is put ourselves into the penalty box by having too many finished stocks.\nAlan Ratner: Okay, that makes sense. And obviously with cancellations normalizing, there's probably some unintentional specs that come out of that as well. And on that point, you mentioned that you're up to this point have been able to resell those cancellations pretty easily. Curious, what's the margin differential been on those resales compared to what you thought the margin was going to be based on the initial sale and backlog versus where it's likely going to settle out at once you deliver the home, now that's going to result?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, it's interesting. Alan, the reality is that most of the cancellations are pretty fresh, right. It's usually in the first 30 or 60 days, where either somebody can't get financing or has buyer remorse. And if you look at the body of cancellations that we had in this quarter, we didn't see a big up tick in the number that were financing related, it was more buyer remorse. And so we haven't seen a big change in the margin profile for the folks that were in the backlog for a long time. So they may have signed their contract late in 2021. Honestly, let's say, they just can't get financing for whatever reason. When we're reselling those homes, we actually see higher prices. And again, that's not the majority, because most of the churn is earlier in the backlog. So not a huge differential, because pricing hasn't moved that much in the 30, 60 days since people signed the contract.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That makes sense, I appreciate it guys. Thanks a lot.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Alan.\nOperator: The next question is from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Ryan, I think I heard you say something, what I found very interesting, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. But I think you said that as rates have sort of settled here a bit, that the ability to sell has improved. So I wanted to make sure that I heard that correctly. And I wanted to kind of get your thoughts on you've been through this many times before. Do you see this being a time of a prolonged sort of slowdown? Or do you think that this is something that's kind of more of a pause? And that once rates do settle, I mean, who knows what they're going to sell higher or lower. But once they do finally settle, I mean do you think that we're going to be back sort of on track again?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, John, I'm going to probably stop short of trying to prognosticate and forecast what the future will hold. But I will tell you, and we said it in our prepared remarks, we're long-term very constructive on housing. We have a fundamental shortage of housing in this country. And I believe that as the Fed navigates this tricky situation of 40-year record high inflation and all the stimulus money, and supply chain issues, and all the things that have kind of -- that are going into our current economic environment, I do believe that housing will continue to have a very strong run. So -- it's with that mindset that we're running our company, we're making decisions on how we invest, that we're making decisions on how we allocate capital, et cetera. So I think, as we move forward, maybe in the medium term, the combination of affordability and consumer confidence is going to continue to drive kind of what happens with housing. We are seeing incomes go up. So somewhere in the middle of all of that soup, I would like to believe that over the long pole housing continues to be successful. And then, John, I think I missed maybe the first part of your question, remind me what that was?\nJohn Lovallo: Sure. Just that I think that you had mentioned, when rates have settled and pulled back here a bit more recently, then your ability to sell has actually improved?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, it probably a little bit of a dead cat bounce, John, I think it was really tough following the last Fed meeting. I think we saw the consumer react quickly. And then as I think the consumer has come to terms with that, as well as we've seen rates actually come down. I think there's been a positive trend in our sales offices. So there's a lot out there as I think we've said, both financially and psychologically, and I think that consumers trying to deal with all those things.\nJohn Lovallo: Got you. And then kind of dovetailing off of what Alan asked, I believe, the strategic decision towards more specs to kind of target the first time buyer in the quick moving, makes a lot of sense in this environment. I guess, how far are you guys willing to shift here? And then how quickly could you actually pivot back if we saw some stabilization?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, it's not just the first time buyer, will be starting specs across the spectrum. And in terms of pivoting back, it can be quickly that is a decision as, it's really just how many homes we want to start and how much demand there is. So if there is a leveling out of the market, such that demand is pretty consistent, we can pivot back particularly for that move up an active adult buyer, where we think the real value of the build-to-order model is very quickly.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, thank you guys.\nRyan Marshall: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you taking my questions. First, I just wanted to circle back to some earlier comments around the increase in incentives, but also kind of highlighting some of the decrease in some of the input costs, you highlighted. Lumber, obviously, where you said maybe 10,000 a home, copper, some other materials. As you think about the increase of specs today, maybe going up, call it a 150 basis points, lumber itself at 10,000 on a 500,000 plus home, that's also perhaps 150 basis points. As you look out, just kind of considering those factors in and of themselves, because obviously, there are a lot of other variables. Does that kind of point to potentially first half gross margins holding 4Q levels or are there other factors that we should be considering as well?\nRyan Marshall: Hey, Mike, I think it's too soon for that, honestly. We've obviously given a Q3 margin guide and a full-year margin guide. We've got a big backlog. And so we've got good visibility and what that margin profile looks like. And then we've certainly made an estimate on the specs that that will sell and close between now and the end of the year, but we'll give our 2023 margin guide later in the year.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Secondly, obviously gotten a few questions about your spec strategy. And I think overall, we would still be fair to consider you guys predominantly a built to order builder. Just wanted to clarify, though, when you talk about, you'd said earlier, that specs are still down on an absolute basis, but you're trying to raise or increase the percentage. If I heard it correctly, I thought that the percentage that you're currently adding that you're trying to increase is more trying to get back to a normalized target even within your build-to-order model, or am I not thinking about that, right. And perhaps you're stretching the limits of where you would normally be in pushing a little bit of a higher level of spec on a relative percent of closing spaces?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, I think that's right. We're at 30% today. So we're at the high side of what our historical ranges, you'll probably see us push a little bit behind that, but beyond that, but it's not as if, we're going to go to 70% spec production. So I think you'll see us predominantly stay a build-to-order builder that's what we believe that's the right way to run a home builder for us, based on the consumers that we target and the way we do communities, but yes, you're going to see a stretch a little beyond maybe what our normal range is. Bob highlighted that by design. We normally have more specs in our Centex communities, which are targeted to the first time buyer. You'll see us put more spec inventory than what we normally do into our move up in our active adult communities. But on a -- it'll be a little bit more than normal.\nMichael Rehaut: All right. Thank you very much.\nRyan Marshall: Yes.\nOperator: Our final question for today is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi Group. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] in on for Anthony. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to know if interest rates stay roughly where they are now, should we expect your sort of elevated cancellation rate to persist into 3Q? Or maybe a drops back down more rapidly as sort of sticker shock wears off? And are you seeing elevated cancellation rates on the homes you're selling in July?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, so I think as Bob highlighted, the uptick that we've seen in cancellations has really been in the last 30 to 60 days. And the probably the leading drivers than buyers are more. So I think a big part of that comes from buyers that were caught. They made it a buying decision during the run up and interest rates and as interest rates and talk of recession have increased, their buyer's remorse has also increased or their fears increased with it. So I think as we get to stability and predictability, we'll likely see, we should see that drop. And our expectation would be that cancellation rates ought to more come into a normal range.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And then I heard it correct on the call, you kind of kept your community count guidance unchanged from last quarter. And so just, if I'm understanding correctly, a slowdown in sales would or would normally saw a community close out, so maybe like a higher community count. So it's just it's the reason for the unchanged guide, maybe a deliberate slowdown in community openings, or maybe some incremental horizontal development challenges, like, for example, permitting?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, obviously, we are dealing with the same kind of challenges everybody else's. So it takes things a little bit longer to get open. What we tell you is that close out the impact isn't that great of stuff that didn't close that we thought was going to. So this is pretty much where we thought would be and reflective of as challenging market to get things open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks. That's very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.\nRyan Marshall: Yes.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Jim Zeumer for any closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the course of the day for follow-up questions. Have a good day and we'll look forward to speaking with you on the next call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Following on Ryan's comments, our second quarter financial results demonstrate both the continuation of positive trends as well as some of the newer challenges which are impacting the market. In the second quarter, PulteGroup's home sale revenues totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of 18% over the prior-year. Higher homebuilding revenues in the second quarter were driven by a 19% or $83,000 increase in average sales price to $531,000. Given our construction cycle times, the increase in average selling prices primarily reflects strong demand and pricing conditions across all buyer groups in the back half of last year. In the quarter, we closed 7,177 homes, which is down less than 1% from last year and a few units below our guide. While the overall production environment remains generally challenging, the shortfall in deliveries is primarily attributable to a specific supplier issue that impacted our Florida markets. More broadly, I think it's fair to say that the supply chain remains challenging. While we are seeing areas of improvement, I would use the word fragile to describe overall conditions. Between limited inventory in the system and bottlenecks in distribution, any disruption in production or shipping can set back construction by a couple of days or weeks. In fact during the second quarter, our overall cycle times extended by another two weeks. That being said, we are feeling a little more optimistic about supply chain conditions getting better through the back half of the year, allowing us to begin playing back workdays next year. The mix of deliveries in the second quarter continued to align with our started targets with 35% from first-time buyers, 39% for move-up buyers, and 26% from active adult buyers. In the second quarter last year, the mix was 30% first-time, 43% move-up and 27% active adult. We reported 6,418 net new orders in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 23% from the second quarter of last year. The decrease in orders reflects both slower sales pace, and higher cancellations resulting from the significant increase in mortgage rates over the past several months. The slowdown in signups impacted all buyer groups. Although our first-time buyers fared the best with orders up 1% to 2,454 homes. Move up orders were lower by 37% to 2,172 homes and active adult orders decreased 27% to 1,792 homes. On a relative basis, the stronger orders among first-time buyers reflects current buyer preference for spec homes that can close sooner with that less interest rate risk. By design, our spec production has been heavily weighted toward our first-time communities. Our reported orders for the quarter also reflects an increase in cancellations as some consumers were impacted by the change in consumer confidence and today's higher rates. On a unit basis, we had 1,152 contracts cancelled in the second quarter up from 665 cancellations last year. This pushed up our cancellation rate for the period to 15% compared with 7% last year. We always want our homebuyers to complete the transaction and enjoy their new Pulte Home, but when cancellations do occur, we have been able to resell the home. In the second quarter we operated from an average of 791 communities, which is a decrease of 2% from an average of 808 communities last year. After several quarters operating at a year-over-year deficit on communities Q2 ship market and flagship point, as we begin showing growth in our year-over-year community counts. More specifically, in the third and fourth quarters we expect to operate from an average of 800 and 830 communities respectively. Both numbers would be up over the comparable prior year period as we begin realizing the impact of increased land investment over the last several years. We ended the quarter with a backlog of 19,176 homes, which is down 4% from last year. While units are down slightly strong price appreciation over the past year has raised our backlog value by 18% to a record of $11.6 billion. At quarter end we had 23,349 homes under construction, which is an increase of 35% over last year. Consistent with Ryan's earlier comments about buyers seeking to minimize time to close, we have increased spec starts and ended the quarter with 6,789 spec units under production. While we have been successful in increasing the overall number of homes under construction, longer cycle times mean that 70% of these units are at the start or framing stage. As such, we expect deliveries in the third quarter to be in the range of 7,000 to 7,400 homes. While we have the homes in production, given changing market conditions and ongoing supply chain issues, we now expect full-year deliveries to be in the range of 30,000 to 31,000 homes. Based on the anticipated mix of closings. We expect the average closing price of homes in the third quarter and for the full-year to be in the range of 540,000 to $550,000. Supported by a strong price appreciation we have realized over the past few quarters, PulteGroup generated substantial gains in our home building gross margin, which increased 430 basis points over last year to 30.9%. In addition to higher prices, our Q2 gross margins reflects the flow through of lower cost lumber purchased in the back half of last year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we've experienced meaningful cost inflation for labor and materials in the current year, led by a significant upswing in lumber cost at the start of this year. Although lumber has decreased again, which will impact our 2023 closings, we've continued to experience incremental house cost inflation as the year has progressed. Based on our most recent internal estimates, we now expect house costs for the year to be up 10% to 12% over last year. Despite the ongoing inflation in materials and labor, including the meaningfully higher lumber costs, we are raising our margin guide for the third quarter and now expect to realize gross margins of approximately 30%. At the present time, we are maintaining our prior guide for fourth quarter gross margins to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%. In the second quarter SG&A expense totaled $351 million, or 9.2% of home sale revenues. In the prior year period our recorded SG&A expense of $272 million, or 8.4% of home sale revenues included a $46 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in that period. Excluding that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense in the second quarter last year was $390 million, or 9.8% of home sale revenues. Based on the number of homes we expect to close in the third and fourth quarters, we are targeting SG&A expense in the third quarter to be in the range of 9.1% to 9.3% of homebuilding revenues. At the midpoint, this would be a roughly 40 basis point improvement over last year. For the full-year we still anticipate SG&A expense to be 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $40 million in the second quarter, which is down from $51 million in the same period last year. The decrease in pre-tax income reflects the extremely competitive market conditions that continue to pressure profitability and capture rate in the business. In the quarter, our capture rate was 78%, down from 86% last year, as we are unwilling to chase market pricing down to unprofitable levels. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $212 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.5%. In the second quarter of last year, our reported tax expense of $136 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.3% included a tax benefit of $12 million, and the benefit of federal energy efficient home credits, which expired as of December 31 last year. Looking at the bottom-line, PulteGroup's reported net income for the second quarter was $652 million, or $2.73 per share. In the prior year, our reported net income was $503 million, or $1.90 per share with adjusted net income for the period of $456 million, or $1.72 per share. In the second quarter, the company continued its active share repurchase program buying back 7.1 million shares for $294 million, or an average price of $41.44 per share. Through the first six months of the year, we have repurchased 17.4 million shares, or 7% of our shares outstanding for $794 million. Throughout the past 10 years, we have taken a fairly systematic approach to our share repurchases. We plan to maintain a routine presence in the market, but given ongoing stock market volatility, we will incorporate more of an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. Over the near term, we believe this strategy allows us to be more responsive to changing market conditions. We ended the quarter with $732 million of cash and a debt-to-capital ratio of 20.8%. We continue to see value and the potential to achieve appropriate risk adjusted returns in many of the land assets we put under control over the last couple of years. As such, we invested $470 million in outright land acquisition during the quarter and invested another $655 million in the development of existing land assets, bringing our total land investment for the second quarter to $1.1 billion. We remain constructive on long-term housing demand, but we appreciate that market conditions are in flux. While we always maintain a disciplined approach to land investment, we are assessing the land positions we have under control to make sure that the underwriting assumptions supporting our investment reflect current market conditions, and that the projected returns still achieve our required return thresholds. At this time, we still expect to invest between $4.5 billion and $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the year with more than half of this spend allocated to developing existing land assets. Given today's changing market dynamics, the optionality of our land book becomes an even more important tool for potentially enhancing returns and controlling risks. We ended the second quarter with 243,000 lots under control, of which 54% were controlled through options. And as we highlighted on our last earnings call, we are assessing ways to meaningfully increase our option lot position to a target range of 65%, 70% of our lots under control. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yes Truman, it's a fair question. In terms of strategically, no, we are not changing where we have been for what is essentially a decade now. We still desire optionality, we still start with individual sellers. What we've offered is that in order to get from where we are today 54% in this most recent print to 65% and 70%, we're likely to be looking at more institutional type relationships. That process is underway, we'll give you updates as we make as transactions occur there, we still think that we can move up from 55% into that 65% to 70% range, take a little bit of time. But in terms of how we're approaching it, not at all, in terms of your question, as it relates to our current attitude and negotiating stance, we've said in the prepared remarks, we've always been, I believe pretty disciplined in how we evaluate our land position and negotiate transactions. That hasn't changed and maybe it's even been heightened. We are taking a close look at everything we are closing on. So as an example, if we put a contract, a parcel under control 18 months ago, that was waiting final entitlements, before we take that down, we are revisiting the underwriting that we had when we approve the transaction to make sure that the absorptions and the pricing and our cost structure because vertical construction costs are up, horizontal development costs are up. So we're looking at it holistically does this transaction makes sense? I will tell you, we have walked away from a couple of transactions where for a number of reasons we just didn't think it made sense whether it was locational or economic, we are also trying to make sure that the timing of takedowns makes sense. And so we have had discussions with sellers that said, hey, our original takedown structure was A, B, and C, and we'd like it to be A, D and E now. I think the sellers, I haven't seen a change in value propositions out there. But the ability to work with time is something that does, and we have taken into account. So long story short, hopefully this is really just continuing to be disciplined in the land buying process. And in a choppy market, yes, you're going to see time become more important to us and in some cases, dollars. So we'll proceed further. Yes, it's interesting, if you look at our ASP in the most recent print, were up 19% the highest kind of growth of ASP is in the first time space, which was up 24% move up and active adult were up about 20%. And so the 19% growth for the company is mix adjusted, right? If you look at our backlog, what we've seen is to answer your question, pricing up across all three. So our backlog ASPs are higher for all three of our key demographics first time move up and activate bill. That is versus the first quarter of this year. And interestingly, the highest increase on a relative basis among those is the move up. Now mix matters and all that, but that move up buyer space is probably the biggest contributor to that increase. Yes. No, maybe the only thing I'd add, if you look at our owned lot position, we own 113,000 lots three months ago, that was 112,000. So despite the investments that we've made in the current quarter as an example, it's not like we're bulking up the owned position. To Ryan's point, we've got flexibility with the option, if you look at our quarterly growth in the balance sheet as an example, we put a lot of money on the balance sheet in this quarter, the majority of that was house, which is going to be quick turning for us. So we put $800 plus million into inventory in the quarter, which is reflective of that $1.1 billion that we spent on land and development. But again, a lot of that is house and it's the cycle time extension that we've talked about. And so we'll get that money back pretty quickly. So hear you loud and clear. We have the ability to influence what our owned lot position looks like, based on the strength of the book we have today."

First one just on the buyer segments, clearly a wide difference there between first-time buyers, move-up and active adult, just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there, clearly with first-time buyers, sort of by definition, potentially more financially constrained into this environment. And as you mentioned, more impacted by the move in rates. And yet you have this significant difference between the Buyer segments. So could you sort of just elaborate a little on what you think is going on there? Thank you. Got it, thank you for that, Ryan. And then second one on the incentives. I think I heard you say at the end, what was initially more related to or the initial incentives being more related to rate buy downs and such now sort of progressing into option and lock premiums coming down. I guess number one, apologies if I didn't hear you, but if you could actually put some numbers or quantify that statement. And number two just as these incentives has progressed, are you actually starting to see any elasticity there? Are you actually starting to see some buyers sort of react positively to those changes in incentives? Thank you. All right, much appreciated. Thank you very much."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And Jim Zeumer, you may begin your conference.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Abby. Good morning. Thanks, everyone, for participating in today\u2019s call to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter earnings for the period ended May 31, 2022. Q1 represents another quarter of strong financial results and has gotten the year off to a great start for us. I am joined on today\u2019s call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will also post an audio replay of this call later today. Please note that as part of this morning\u2019s call, we will review our prior year results as reported and as adjusted to exclude the impact of a $61 million pretax charge associated with the bond tender and a $10 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. A reconciliation of prior year adjusted results and reported financial results is included in this morning\u2019s release and within today\u2019s webcast slides. We encourage you to review these tables to assist in your analysis of our business performance. I also want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. As Bob will detail shortly, PulteGroup delivered outstanding first quarter financial results with year-over-year growth of 18% home sale revenues and 43% in adjusted earnings per share. The significant increase in our Q1 earnings per share reflects gains in a number of areas, including higher selling prices, expanded gross margins, increased overhead leverage and our active share repurchase program. PulteGroup\u2019s first quarter financial results are just the most recent in a string of strong quarters that have raised our return on equity to 29.4% for the trailing 12 months. There is a lot for investors to be excited about in terms of the company\u2019s operating and financial performance. Taking a step back from the specifics of our Q1 financial results, I think, it\u2019s fair to say that, the supply/demand dynamics of the first quarter were consistent with the trends the industry has been experiencing for the past year or more. In short, demand was strong, available inventory was scarce and the incoming supply is limited. Let me take a minute to expand on these thoughts. On the demand side, consumer interest in purchasing a new home remained high throughout the quarter. With few exceptions, demand was strong across all the price points, buyer groups and markets that we serve. The U.S. housing market continues to benefit from favorable demographics, a strong economy, an outstanding job market and a rising wage environment. New home sales are also benefiting from ongoing and significant increases in rental rates for single and multifamily dwellings. According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting, their numbers indicate that rental prices for single-family homes increased by upwards of 5% in 2021, while multifamily lease rates were up by approximately 13% over the prior year. Forecast point to further increases in 2022. Even with today\u2019s higher prices and rising rates, owning a home can still make clear economic sense for many consumers. Not only can homebuyers get a comparable or even lower monthly payment, but that payment is more stable over time. Given this demand strength in the first quarter, we were able to raise prices in effectively all of our communities with sequential price increases in the range of 1% to 5% common across the country. In addition to the fundamental strength in homebuyer demand, home price appreciation is benefiting from a lack of available inventory in both new and resale. Similar to buying a new car these days, people who are shopping for a home understand how competitive the market is. This brings me to the supply side of the equation. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, our teams did an outstanding job advancing our homes through the construction process and even surpassed the high end of our closing guidance. I want to recognize the efforts of our homebuilding operations to manage through the constraints and the availability of people and materials that are impacting everything from land entitlement and development to home construction. Depending on the specific market, the availability of labor and materials has at best remain the same, but in certain areas conditions have gotten a little worse and build cycles have gotten longer. Given these challenging conditions, our production time lines extended by about one week in the first quarter and now stand at 145 days to 150 days in most of our divisions. With only a couple of days remaining in April, unless dynamics change dramatically in the next couple of weeks, which does not look likely any improvement in the supply chain would provide a more meaningful benefit to 2023 production. Bob\u2019s comments will include us reaffirming our guide for expected 2022 deliveries of 31,000 homes and I would highlight that this guidance assumes that the availability of labor and materials does not change for better or worse. With our production cycles remaining extended, we continue to tightly control sales in most of our communities across the country. We appreciate these restrictions can be frustrating for consumers, but it is the right strategic decisions given overall conditions. From both the customer experience and a business risk perspective, it doesn\u2019t make sense to extend our backlog out a year or more just to record another sign up. Even with all of these challenges, I want to highlight that we started almost 9,000 homes in the first quarter and that we now have approximately 5,200 spec homes in production. The majority of these homes are in the initial start and framing stages, but we would expect these houses to deliver in the back half of 2022. As we have noted on prior calls, our spec production is largely focused in our entry level communities. In sum, I think it\u2019s fair to say that housing demand remains strong, home prices continue to rise and the supply of new construction homes coming to market is constrained. That being said, the Federal Reserve has been very clear in signaling that interest rates are going higher as they seek to control inflation that has hit 40-year highs. There are a lot of favorable market dynamics that can support ongoing buyer demand in the face of higher rates, but the Fed is intent on slowing down the economy and this certainly has the potential to impact the housing industry. Given this dynamic, it makes sense for us to take actions to position our business for continued success. For now, this means focusing on our land acquisition practices. Internally, we are committed to increasing our option lot position and have set a goal of having 65% to 70% of our future land pipeline controlled under option. Our disciplined land investment process helped us to place some great land positions under control over the past several years and we will be closing on -- that we will be closing on in 2022. Going forward, we will continue our thoughtful approach to investing in the business and we will be prepared to make adjustments in response to changing market conditions. We certainly expect that our land teams can continue to identify tremendous land opportunities, but we want to make sure that only the best projects ultimately get approved. Now let me turn over to Bob for additional comments on our first quarter. Bob?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan highlighted, the year has gotten off to an excellent start as home sale revenues in the first quarter were up 18% over last year to $3.1 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by an 18% increase in average sales price to $508,000, while closings of 6,039 homes were consistent with last year. The higher ASP for the period was driven by double-digit gains in pricing within our first-time move-up and active adult fire groups. By buyer group, our mix of closings for the first quarter was also consistent with last year, as we made -- we remain well balanced across the primary buyer groups. In the quarter, 35% of buyers were first time, 40% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time, 44%, move-up and 23%, active adult. In the first quarter, we recorded net new orders of 7,971 homes, which is down 19% from last year. Lower orders for the quarter were primarily the 7% decrease in community count, combined with the impact of aggressively controlling sales paces, given ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. As has been the case for the past several quarters, we continue to restrict sales in many communities in order to align sales with current production pace. Looking more closely at our order activity, orders to first-time buyers decreased 13% to 2,710 homes, while orders to move up buyers were lower by 22% to 3,341 homes and active adult orders declined 23% to 1,920 homes. The relative outperformance among first-time buyers is due to the availability of the spec production we started in the back half of 2021 that supported some incremental orders. Between delays in municipal approvals and extended land development time lines, it is taking longer for some communities to open for sale. As a result, in addition to being down from the prior year, our first quarter average community count of 777 was slightly below our previous guidance. We expect the modest drag in the community openings that we experienced in the first quarter to continue for the remainder of the year. As such, we now expect that our average community count in the second quarter will be 780, with growth to 800 in the third quarter and 830 in the fourth quarter. Reflective of the strength -- strong demand conditions we experienced in the quarter, our cancellation rate remained exceptionally low at 9%. In total, we ended the first quarter with a unit backlog of 19,935 homes, which is an increase of 5% over last year. The dollar value of our backlog increased 31% to $11.5 billion, which reflects the 5% unit growth combined with a significant year-over-year increase in our ASP and backlog. As Ryan noted, our teams are doing a great job moving homes through the production cycle in light of the challenges the industry is facing and the availability of labor and materials. As a result, we ended the first quarter with 21,269 homes under construction, which is an increase of 44% over last year. This production number includes 5,181 spec homes that are currently in the pipeline, which is almost triple our spec units at this time last year. At quarter end, specs were 24% of units under production as we continue to make steady progress toward our goal of 25% to 30%. Our overall production pipeline is still early in the construction process as 28% of these homes are at the initial start stage with 43% of the homes at the framing stage. We ended the quarter with only 64 finished specs, which is consistent with our comments that homes made available for sale sell quickly. Based on the universe of homes in production, as well as their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 7,200 and 7,600 homes in the second quarter. Again, assuming no significant improvement or erosion in the availability of labor and/or materials, we still expect to deliver 31,000 homes for the year, which would be an increase of 7% over last year. On our prior earnings call, we noted that, given supply constraints and limited opportunity to meaningfully increase construction pace, we would rely on price as the bigger lever to maximize return. Looking at the dollar value of our backlog and new orders, you can see that this is what has occurred. Based on the average price in backlog and the mix of homes we expect to deliver, we expect our second quarter closings to have an ASP in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. Inclusive of the $508,000 average sales price realized in Q1 and the first-time spec homes we expect to deliver in the back half of the year, we now expect our average sales price for the full year to also be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. As we always highlight, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Given the ongoing strong demand conditions, we have been able to increase sales prices sufficiently to offset rising costs and to further expand our gross margin. In the first quarter, homebuilding gross margin was 29%, which is an increase of 350 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is up 220 basis points sequentially. In addition to the strong demand and pricing environment, our Q1 deliveries also benefited from the flow-through of lower cost lumber, as prices for wood products rolled over in the back half of last year. Until a recent pullback, lumber prices had moved significantly higher since the beginning of the year, which will impact our closings in the back half of this year. Beyond lumber, we are continuing to see meaningful inflation in most materials and labor costs. As such, even with the recent pullback in lumber, we expect house cost inflation exclusive of land cost to be in the range of 10% to 12% for the full year. Based on the strength of recent selling conditions and despite the volatility in the materials and labor market, we now expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.5% to 30% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year. Given the timing and impact of lumber and other input costs, we expect to be towards the higher end of this range in Q2, but likely toward the end -- lower end of the range in the third and fourth quarters. As always, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we will update you on our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year. Our SG&A expense in the first quarter was $329 million or 10.7% of home sale revenues, which is in line with our earlier guidance. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense of $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues included a pretax insurance benefit of $10 million. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Given expected homebuilding revenues for the coming quarters, we currently expect SG&A expense in the second quarter to be in the range of 9.4% to 9.6%, which would be a 30-basis-point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint. For the full year, we now expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. First quarter pretax income for our financial services operations was $41 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $66 million. Lower pretax income for the current period is reflective of a much more competitive market conditions which negatively impacted our capture rate and overall profitability per loan. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81%, down from 88% last year. Our reported tax expense for the first quarter was $145 million for an effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our effective tax rate in the period was lower than our recent guidance. We recorded benefits related to equity compensation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in each quarter over the balance of the year. Our reported net income for the first quarter was $454 million or $1.83 per share. In the comparable prior year period, our reported net income was $304 million or $1.13 per share, while adjusted net income was $343 million or $1.28 per share. In the first quarter, the company repurchased 10.3 million common shares or approximately 4% of the shares outstanding at the end of 2021 at an average price of $48.59. Relative to the first quarter of last year, our share count is down by almost 10%. In addition to allocating $500 million to share repurchases in the first quarter, we invested $1.1 billion of land acquisition and development. This keeps us on track to achieve our prior guidance of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of land spend for the full year, with more than 50% of that spend being for development of existing land assets. Inclusive of our first quarter spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 52% were held under option. Our strong land pipeline provides us with the lot need to grow our business, while allowing us to focus future investment on projects that meet our underwriting standards. Even after allocating approximately $1.6 billion to investment in the business and share repurchases, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 21.5%. It\u2019s worth mentioning here that as highlighted in this morning\u2019s earnings release, Moody\u2019s Investors Service recently noted the strength of our operations and overall financial position when they upgraded PulteGroup\u2019s senior unsecured ratings from Baa2 -- to Baa2 from Baa3. As Ryan discussed, given the Federal Reserve comments that we were in for a period of rising rates, we are acutely focused on ways to mitigate land related risk. In recent years, we have established a land pipeline that can support the ongoing growth of our operations, but provides optionality should demand conditions change in the future. Going forward, we will continue to emphasize the use of lot options or comparable structures to control rather than own positions and we are actively working to increase our percentage of option lots within our land portfolio. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. We realized continued strong buyer demand in the first quarter and buyer interest has remained high through April. That being said, a 200-basis-point increase in mortgage rates since the start of the year is likely to have an impact on consumers. Even with the potential for changes in demand, I think the limited supply of available homes means prices can remain high and puts the construction industry in an advantageous position to weather future demand volatility. As we sit here today, the bigger challenge by far isn\u2019t getting houses sold, but rather getting them built. That said, it is important that we take actions now to put PulteGroup in the best possible position for continued success. Based on recent field visits and walking numerous job sites, I can personally tell you that our teams are doing an amazing job getting our homes constructed. I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts and I have to highlight the work of our corporate and field-based procurement teams, sourcing even the most basic materials can change from week-to-week, but this group has learned to adapt and find solutions to the most challenging situations. Before opening the call to questions, I would also like to highlight that PulteGroup was again ranked among the 100 Best Companies to Work for by Great Place to Work and Fortune Magazine. We didn\u2019t just rank again this year but jumped up 32 positions to number 43 on the list. Being ranked is certainly a nice acknowledgment, but much more important is actually having an amazing and supportive culture that makes PulteGroup a place where people want to be. This is an important competitive advantage when working to attract and retain the most talented individuals. Now let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We are now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Abby, if you will explain the process, we will get started.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.\nAshley Kim: Hi. This is Ashley Kim on for Matt today. Thanks for all the colors. So, just my first question, understanding that you kind of saw order strength across the business, but just wondering if there\u2019s any reason to think that those communities are specifically thinking entry level buyers may begin to see greater challenges given where rates are going?\nRyan Marshall: Well, actually, I think, it\u2019s a fair question. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, the demand that we saw in the first quarter was exceptionally strong and that\u2019s continued into April. To your point, if there is a buyer group that will be more impacted by rising rates, it\u2019s certainly the first-time buyer. For -- it\u2019s for that reason, among others that we have maintained the importance of our diversified and balanced consumer strategy. We have about 35% of our business that\u2019s specifically targeted to entry level. We do tend to play at the higher price points within the entry-level consumer group. So I think it gives us some room to move around. The other piece that we have done here to help with the kind of buying process is most of those homes were starting to specs and we are not releasing them for sale until they are closer to the delivery window, which I think shortens the amount of time that a buyer will be waiting to take delivery of their home in our backlog.\nAshley Kim: Thanks for that. And then have you done any recent stress tests on your backlog to kind of see what the potential risk there as your buyers kind of sit in backlog for a while to lock in rates?\nRyan Marshall: We have -- actually, Bob, will give you a little color on that.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. I think we are always obviously in close contact with our backlog. We have seen people taking a longer rate lock position and so we have highlighted that an increase in rates is a single-digit -- 100-basis-point rate increases a single-digit, perhaps, impact on our backlog. It\u2019s interesting, most of the folks that are there have significant equity built up in their house and so they have expressed that they want to close. And so we have lots of different ways that we can help people get there, whether it\u2019s to source additional income, if they have some additional down payment different programs. So the backlog is pretty solid, and obviously, people have changed in circumstances we work with them as best we can to try to get them to closing table.\nAshley Kim: Thanks for that and good luck on the quarter.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and nice quarter.\nRyan Marshall: Thank you.\nAlan Ratner: So, I guess, a lot we could drill on it. Maybe first just kind of talk a little bit about the land portfolio. Obviously you guys are making an effort there option share higher. If I look at your lot count today, about 235,000 lots, that\u2019s up about 50,000, 60,000 from the end of 2020, and I guess, you have delivered probably 30,000, 35,000 lots over that timeframe or homes over that timeframe as well. So is the right way to think about it that agnostic to the option and own split that roughly 90,000, 100,000, so maybe 40% of your portfolio has been kind of contracted or tied up for over the last 18 months -- 15 months, 18 months or I know there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces there. So I am trying to figure out maybe if you can provide some color on the vintage of your portfolio of land and how much actually has been tied up as of late?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Alan, it\u2019s -- I think a way to think about it is pre- and post-pandemic, just to be simple and we would tell you that half of it is pre and half of its post. Obviously, we put things under control, oftentimes a fair amount of time in advance of when we actually take the lots down and so owned versus option plays into that. On balance, it\u2019s usually taken us 12 months to 24 months to get from contract to getting communities open. So I don\u2019t know if that gets you there, but roughly 50% is pre-pandemic or two years to three years ago.\nRyan Marshall: [Inaudible]\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And that was, I guess, pretty close to the numbers I was getting to there. So I guess when you think about the land market today and the move towards off-balance sheet and what\u2019s going on in the industry in general. Have you seen any led up over the last few months and the competitiveness of the land market? What\u2019s the inflation rate running at across your portfolio right now? And what\u2019s the outlook going forward, I mean, do you think that some of these deals might get re-traded if things do soften a little bit or is there just so much embedded kind of margin profit in them right now that kind of what\u2019s spoken for is likely going to move forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Alan, it\u2019s Ryan. I would tell you the land market remains competitive. Certainly, we have other new homebuilders that are buying for the prime parcels and there\u2019s other options as well, might it be apartments or other types of users for the land. So I think if you have got a well-located parcel of land, it\u2019s competitive, always has been, I think, always likely will be. In terms of kind of what we have seen with more recent optionality. We have pushed from two years ago or three years ago where we were kind of in the 30%s, 30% range in terms of amount of options. Today, we sit at 52%. As you have heard, we are going to push that higher, we have kind of set a goal and a target for ourselves to be in the 65% to 70% range. In terms of your question about, is there potential for things to be re-traded. We are purchasing this year, Alan, I would tell you there\u2019s likely no need for that. To your point, there\u2019s a lot of embedded value. These are parcels that were put under contract or under control 18 months to 24 months ago and so, they are great deals and we are going to close on them. We are going to be really thoughtful and judicious around what we are underwriting. What we are putting under control now that will be closings in 2023 and 2024. Those are the parcels that, I think, are more susceptible to being tighter in terms of economics that meet our standards and it\u2019s part of the reason that we think it\u2019s so important that you have got optionality in your land portfolio because it gives you the flexibility to maneuver.\nAlan Ratner: That\u2019s great. I appreciate the color there. And if I could sneak in one just housekeeping question, do you have the share of your orders this quarter that be considered kind of non-primary buyers thinking single-family rental, investors/like homeowners. I am not sure if you track that, but any disclosure you can give there and the trend would be great?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. It\u2019s pretty consistent with history at about 3% to 5%, Alan.\nAlan Ratner: Great. All right. And that includes the SFR business that you have been involved with?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: We don\u2019t have much of that at this point. Those closings are coming next year.\nAlan Ratner: Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, thanks for the balanced commentary. I wanted to press on the strategy of restricting sales a little bit, because I think we are all synthetic to the supply chain issues, and obviously, recent quarters, been very clear that, that\u2019s the right thing to do, but this is a pretty dynamic and rapidly evolving market, especially with rates. You seem to be acknowledging being a little bit more guarded around what may or may not happen with demand at least in the near-term. And so why is it still the strategy to be so restrictive on sales versus, say, you get the buyers signed up, get them into backlog and then be able to work with them on extended rate locks or things like that could give a little bit more certainty and visibility?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Mike, it\u2019s a great question. I think the biggest reason is inflation. We are in a hyperinflationary environment for all things in the world. And as we had -- as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks to go out and put another buyer in backlog that\u2019s not going to be able to close on their home for another year, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great experience for anybody. The consumer doesn\u2019t want to wait that long. They are susceptible to all kinds of potential fluctuations in interest rates, which they may or may not be able to handle. And then we have locked in our economics in terms of what we are charging the consumer at the point that we sign the contract. And then we are exposed to a year plus of potential moves in commodity inflation and we just don\u2019t think that makes sense for our customer and their experience and it certainly doesn\u2019t make sense for economics. So we really like the way the production environment moving. We started almost 9,000 homes in the quarter, which I think demonstrates that we are getting units in the ground. We were able to close homes that were at the high end of our guide, which I think also demonstrates the fact that we are -- we have got pretty good control and predictability around what\u2019s in production and so we are actively moving through bringing our backlog down to a level where we can start to release more things for sale and we are certainly looking forward to that.\nMike Dahl: Got it. And just as a follow-up to the last one. As you make that progress, I mean, how do you envision the year playing out in terms of the restrictions and your ability to lift those. And then as kind of follow-on to the first one, but if I could add a second different question. Just anything you are seeing around upgrades, options, things that might be more leading edge in terms of highlighting some new buyer sensitivities?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Mike, we don\u2019t -- I think as you are aware, we don\u2019t guide to new orders. So we will stop short of doing that on this call. We are seeing some minor wins in the supply chain and we are having pretty good luck getting homes in the ground. The first quarter is still a quarter where you deal with a fair amount of weather. So to get 9,000 new starts, I think, demonstrates that the supply -- that our production pipeline has moved. So I think it\u2019s fair to assume if we can continue at that rate, that you will start to see some restrictions lifted on the way we are releasing lots and releasing homes for potential sale over the balance of the year. We are reaffirming our guide or we did reaffirm our guide of 31,000 closings for the year and that assumes that the kind of supply chain environment kind of stays about like it is right now.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. And to your question on option and lot premium spend. It was almost $100,000 a unit in the most -- in this print. That\u2019s up 23%, which I think reflects the strength of the market. And you can -- we don\u2019t provide that level of detail on our -- on the orders we have taken, but you can see from the average sales prices being up, we are not seeing much change on that at all.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Great. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Bob.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan.\nMike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but wanted to dial in a little bit in terms of intra-quarter trends and I know sometimes you are reticent to get into month to month. But as you have seen, obviously, a tremendous move in rates during the quarter, I was curious if you witnessed any change in terms of either cancellation rates month-to-month or any change in the marketplace, let\u2019s say, not just you, but with regards to incentives or discounts or even rate of price increases that have occurred? \nRyan Marshall: Hey, Mike. Good morning. This is Ryan. Good question. And the sales pace throughout the quarter was incredibly consistent, because we were controlling it. So we set a rate that we were willing to sell at and so you saw a very similar performance January to February, February to March. Ordinarily, you would actually, I think, in a -- given it\u2019s the spring selling season, you would see sales orders build through the quarter and we just didn\u2019t let that this year. Discounts are non-existent. We were less than 1% in the quarter, which is down from where it was in the same quarter last year. And price increases remained on a fairly consistent predictable cadence with what we have been over the past six months to nine months. So I think the short answer is, the market is still healthy, demand is still strong, there are more buyers out there than we are able to build homes for right now.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Great. Thanks for that. Secondly, just a question on the planned increase to lot option, I was wondering whether or not that\u2019s going to be driven by predominantly just by simply an increase in option lots going forward and perhaps keeping the owned lots flat. You did see your own lots go up, looks like about, I want to say, roughly 15% or so over the last few quarters, wondering if that might reverse even. And with a significantly higher level of lot optioning, if the, with the cash flow generation or reduced cash requirements of running a business like that, how that might change your repurchase or other uses of capital?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Mike, I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on actual owned lots at any one point in time. I think we are trying to grow the business to do that. You have to have lots on the ground. You have to develop them. Some of it will depend on whether we are buying raw that we are self-developing or if we have arrangements that provide us finished lots. So there\u2019s a lot of things that will influence that. In terms of what that does ultimately to our capital allocation, I think, you have seen us, as we have driven that option percentage higher, we have been generating a significant amount of cash and we have been using that cash to continue to invest in the business and to buy back stock. You saw that we obviously bought back a lot of stock this quarter. Our lens on that doesn\u2019t change, right? So, if we have excess capital and if that\u2019s being generated by a more efficient balance sheet, we will evaluate the needs for that capital and one of those is going to be share repurchases. So I think at the end of the day, it does a couple of things for us. One, it provides us some flexibility and protection from market risk. It yields higher returns and it yields higher free cash that we would use, again, consistently with what we have done over the past 10 years.\nMike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate it.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First I just wanted to ask, compared to prior periods of rising mortgage rates, how quickly would you have seen an impact and then how does that compare to how homebuyers have responded with this most recent spike in rates?\nRyan Marshall: Well, I think, it\u2019s difficult to compare periods of rising rates, because of the factors that are driving those rising rates are so different. And we happen to be in an inflationary environment with an economy that is continuing to run pretty hot. We are seeing real wage growth. We are seeing a low unemployment environment and there\u2019s a real shortage of supply. So there -- the other thing that I think its work highlighting, in this rate environment is the impact of the pandemic and so I think trying to compare to rising rate environment, well, I am sure, you can do it. I think the conclusion will drop will likely not be terrible informative.\nRafe Jadrosich: Okay. That makes sense. And then, can you just give a little more color on the serve initiatives there shift more towards lot of option, do you have sort of time line for the shift to the 65% to 70%? And then, can you just talk about willingness and ability to work with land developers and bankers to shift more towards option contract?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. So it will take some time. It will be probably the next two plus years that you will see us progressively move there. But history is guide, I think, when we have laid targets like this out for our operating team. And frankly, we shared it with the investment community we have executive against it. We certainly think that we do that here as well, which give us the reason that gives us that we have got confidence to kind of put that target out there. I think it\u2019s very doable. There are number of ways in which will effectuate moving from where we sit today to higher level of optionality, some of that will done with directly with the land sellers. We think that\u2019s arguably the best way to do it. Sometimes we will work with development partners that are actually putting finished lots on the ground for us and there are some other alternative arrangements that you can use to get optionality in the land book as well. So I think you should expect us to probably use a mix of all of those things as we move to more optionality. We think it\u2019s got a lot of benefits in terms of managing risk. But certainly very capital efficient, it helps to drive returns to a better place and we will use that in cash flow for some of the things that Bob highlighted a minute ago, including share repurchases.\nRafe Jadrosich: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on that prior question with you all targeting more option land over the next couple of years, I am just hoping, if you look at today maybe versus six months ago, regarding land bankers or landowners, developers that you are optioning from. Have you seen any change in terms of the deals, deposits, interest costs, et cetera or even any sort of change in their appetite to continue doing deals?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. Truman, I don\u2019t -- not really, right? I mean, the market, I think, is pretty efficient. We have not seen a reduction in desire. So if we are talking to folks, there is money available. The question for us has always been, can we make the economics make sense and you have seen things tighten a little bit, which is good. For us, again, the goal is to try and create a transaction that yields us an acceptable return and gives us some flexibility and I don\u2019t think that the market has changed appreciably. We are trying to broaden relationships. We are talking to different folks. We still probably start at if it\u2019s a land seller trying to work out a deal with them first. What we are really doing now is saying, okay, if they are not willing to do some sort of option, does it make sense to put a third party between us and the dirt before we close. More to come on that to Ryan\u2019s point. It will take some time. But we are working through it.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Bob, I believe earlier you mentioned that there\u2019s been some increase in buyer interest and extended rate locks. I am just hoping to understand, have you all proactively gone to the buyers in your back and encourage them to lock, are you introducing rate lock programs? And in a similar light, are you all increasing either deposit escrow requirements given the current market strength in the face of rising rates?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. To the latter one, we always seek a fair deposit and we are continuing to do that today. In terms of working with our consumers, we still enjoy a very robust capture rate. We do offer. We think attractive rate lock programs. We have seen people go out a little bit longer. They are locking a little bit earlier. And we are encouraging them to do that, because the rate environment is going to move, it seems and has moved against them. So we have seen, in particular, the sort of the 60-day rate lock environment, which is when people are getting closing dates typically. We have seen a lot of people participating in that.\nTruman Patterson: Okay. Got you. But not too much longer than 60 days?\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. That goes to the individual, candidly. We offer it. We have got long rate locks. But it gets expensive, Truman. So they are\u2026\nTruman Patterson: Okay.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: \u2026 great for the consumer.\nTruman Patterson: All right. Thank you and good luck in the upcoming year.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Truman.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Lovallo with UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. The first one, it sounds like with your community count expectations over the next few quarters and in your current spec production we could see a nice reacceleration in orders in the back half, so just curious your thoughts on that? And then along the lines, the outlook doesn\u2019t seem to include or incorporate any improvement in labor room materials. But if we take a step back, just curious what your view is on that, I mean, how do you assess the probability that we could see some improvement in those areas in the back half and if we could see some potential ramp in production?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. John, good morning. Thanks for the question. On the community count side, we are dragging a little bit from where we would optimally have liked to have been and it\u2019s mostly around entitlement delays with municipalities. It\u2019s always been hard and it\u2019s taken a long time to get through the entitlement process. I would tell you, cities and city councils and planning and zoning boards, while I think most are back and working, it\u2019s just simply taking longer. So really nothing there that I would highlight other than it\u2019s taken us a few months longer than ideal. In terms of kind of the supply environment, we are operating under the assumption that things are going to continue to remain hard for the balance of 2022, which means we are -- that\u2019s why we have reaffirmed the guide that we gave. I will take you back to the commentary that we gave at the end of Q4, our assumption was that 2022 is going to remain a very difficult supply chain year and we are still there. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, John, if we are to see some improvement and I\u2019d like optimistically, I think, we have got to start turning the corner soon. That\u2019s mostly going to benefit our 2023 production. We are clearly not there yet in terms of kind of giving guidance. And then, finally, in terms of kind of new orders and more communities and less sales restrictions. I think that all can be interpreted as a positive for the future. But we don\u2019t give forward guidance in terms of orders. So we will -- while we are optimistic, we will report the news when we get there.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Ryan. And then just lastly, on the sequential price increases of 1% to 5%, can you just remind us, how does that compare to the last couple of quarters?\nRyan Marshall: It\u2019s very similar. Not a lot of change. It was a strong quarter and pretty similar to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. My observation is that investors are just really struggling to understand how in the face of such higher rates, the demand is still holding up. And Ryan, I thought you did a good job of clarifying that, it\u2019s really just that the supply is so constrained that the demand can come down, but it will still be greater demand than supply. So just to push on that a little bit more and to clarify, when you talk about rate locks, which is something that we have been hearing builders talk a lot more about in recent days, I just want to confirm that the orders that you are taking and that you have taken, let\u2019s say, over the last month, forgetting about the closings, but the orders, those buyers are -- but today\u2019s buyers are qualifying at today\u2019s rate and if they are locking, they are basically at today\u2019s rate. So there\u2019s nothing about the orders today that reflects an obsolete rate environment. I just wanted to have you confirm that for us?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Stephen, that\u2019s exactly right. Buyers that are purchasing today or purchased in the first quarter, we qualified them at the rate when they applied for a mortgage. It\u2019s part of the reason that Bob touched on, the comment that we made about stress testing our backlog, those buyers would have qualified at whatever rate was there in a prior period. And largely, those buyers are still able to qualify and for the ones that are maybe a little tighter. We have got programs and things that we can do to help get them over the hump. But to your question, Stephen, and I think the most important thing is, yeah, the buyers that are signing up today are qualifying in today\u2019s rate environment. And the reason that they are locking or doing longer rate locks is because they are making the trade between the cost of that forward longer term rate lock against the volatility that they think might play out in the interest rate environment.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. I totally get that and I think that\u2019s super important, because we have been getting some people some conversation, where I think people got a little confused about that. So thanks for clarifying. The second question relates also on the rate situation in incentives. So one of the things that I have been wondering about is that, as you have seen the rates move up and you have seen cycle times extended. In many cases, you might have a situation over the next, let\u2019s say, a couple of quarters where you have buyers who rate lock expired or they didn\u2019t rate lock and the home is closing later than it ordinarily would have exposing them to a higher rate when they close. And so I am wondering, does your -- it sounds like today, rate locks and things like that are being borne by the buyer. But when it comes to the closing table, does your gross margin guidance assume that there may be some increase in sort of last minute incentives, like maybe a rate buy down or something due to this sort of unusual circumstance or is that -- and is that something you envisioned? Just trying to get a sense for how that might be factored or might be an issue as we go forward and to what degree it\u2019s been contemplated in your gross margin guidance?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Stephen, there are certainly kind of one-off scenarios where we have to work through some kind of a challenging situation with the consumer. We pride ourselves on outstanding customer experience and doing the right thing for the consumer, which by and large, I think, we do always. The buyers that are in backlog have got tremendous backlog -- tremendous equity built up based on when they purchased. They are excited to close and so there\u2019s not really a need for a lot of negotiation at the closing table. They want to be in their homes. They have got tremendous value built up. They are closing. So the -- the gross margin guide that we have given incorporates all of the information that we have, and kind of what we would expect to play out over the coming quarters and the balance of the year and it\u2019s a healthy gross margin, as I think, you can probably appreciate.\nStephen Kim: Oh! Yeah. Absolutely. Well, great. Thanks for the help. Just one observation, your comment when you said about half of your land is pre-pandemic. If -- just making sure that, that\u2019s half of your controlled land, which means that basically all of your owned lots, the effective equivalent of all of your owned lots are pre-pandemic. It\u2019s because about -- you have about half of your lots controlled, which are also owned, right, actually a little less than that, right?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Stephen, that\u2019s fair.\nStephen Kim: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. There\u2019s a lot of talk on supply chain constrain, how it\u2019s getting better, in fact, a week elongated. But even with all of this, your closings came in above your high end of guide. I am curious was there anything that particularly drove the beat, like did you find additional resources quicker than expected, maybe had better work around or was just maybe things like Omicron or weather were just not as bad as you anticipated when you originally guided?\nRyan Marshall: Well, look, we are slightly on the high end and so high end of our guide, which we are thrilled with. I think it\u2019s more a testament to the strength of our operations team, our construction team that really work incredibly hard to deliver homes in a tough environment and it\u2019s hard out there. I think we have done a better job based on being in this environment now for a year, probably, going on almost two years that we have probably got better forecasting methodologies and assuming how and how quickly things are going to move through the cycle. But it continues to be tough out there, but that\u2019s not taking anything away from our construction team that I think really knocked it out of the park.\nDeepa Raghavan: No. That\u2019s fair. So, yeah, it was good execution. No doubt. But I was just curious if the guide was set a little conservatively to begin with. Anyways, my follow-up is on, again, supply chain issues, but more categories based. Is any of your categories like active levels versus first-time buyer experiencing any tougher supply chain issues versus the other, just given that some products maybe perhaps unique to some categories or is it similar level of constraints? And also, should we -- if and when we go into a market slowdown near-term, can you talk through which of these categories you think you can take the most share in? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: And to your first question on are there particular supplies? No. I think it\u2019s consistent across buyer groups and it\u2019s kind of the same commodities, the same items that continue to see constrained things that involve microchips are hard to come by. There are some commodities, some lumber components that are difficult for sure. So, but in terms of differences between buyer groups, I wouldn\u2019t highlight anything. As for kind of are there consumer segments where we could take share. I would tell you, we are looking to grow our company across the Board. Our mix of business today is exactly where we want it positioned and so as we look to grow the company, we will look to do it equally across all consumer segments. I\u2019d highlight that our Del Webb brand remains the most recognized and powerful brand within the active Adult Consumer Group. And so we like what we are able to do there. Similarly, we like the gains that we have made in the entry level consumer space with our Centex product, which that product is mostly being sold or started as a spec home and sold just prior to the home being finished.\nDeepa Raghavan: Thanks very much. Good luck. I will pass it on.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Deepa actually asked one of my questions, so I just have one. I wanted to ask how traffic trended during the quarter and into April. And then how much does it matter? If interest lists are heavy relative to what you can use and you are using best and final offer pricing more frequently and more Internet marketing, is traffic still the leading indicator of sales that we have all used to think it has been. I am just interested in your perspective on that and that\u2019s all I got. Thanks, guys.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Carl, I think, to your point, traffic is not as good an indicator of the strength of the market as maybe what it used to be. Most of our communities don\u2019t have available inventory that you can buy off the lot, so to speak. So some of the things that we are really paying attention to today is the traffic to our website, virtual visits, in addition to the customers that actually come into the stores or the model parks physically. So it\u2019s important, trust me, we pay attention to it, it\u2019s something that I watch on a weekly basis, what\u2019s going on with our traffic. But it is a little bit different right now compared to how it used to be. The difference maybe between now and pre-pandemic is the virtual traffic, which is ridiculously strong compared to maybe a prior cycle.\nCarl Reichardt: And how was walk-in over the course of the quarter, Ryan, and into April?\nRyan Marshall: I don\u2019t have those numbers. Does that walk-in, Carl, you were asking...\nCarl Reichardt: Walk-in. Walk-in. Just what we consider old school traffic, let\u2019s say.\nBob O'Shaughnessy: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting, because of everything Ryan just said, that is relative to pre-pandemic good, but declining a little bit and mostly because I think people know there\u2019s no inventory to look at. So they are not coming into the stores often but they are still searching for homes and literally and figuratively. Many places have such limited lot releases that there\u2019s not anything to go look at.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay. Thank you, Bob. Appreciate it. Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Zeumer, I will turn the call back over to you.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you, Abby. Appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We are certainly available for questions as we go through the remainder of the day and we will look forward to speaking with you on our next call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. As Bob will detail shortly, PulteGroup delivered outstanding first quarter financial results with year-over-year growth of 18% home sale revenues and 43% in adjusted earnings per share. The significant increase in our Q1 earnings per share reflects gains in a number of areas, including higher selling prices, expanded gross margins, increased overhead leverage and our active share repurchase program. PulteGroup's first quarter financial results are just the most recent in a string of strong quarters that have raised our return on equity to 29.4% for the trailing 12 months. There is a lot for investors to be excited about in terms of the company's operating and financial performance. Taking a step back from the specifics of our Q1 financial results, I think, it's fair to say that, the supply/demand dynamics of the first quarter were consistent with the trends the industry has been experiencing for the past year or more. In short, demand was strong, available inventory was scarce and the incoming supply is limited. Let me take a minute to expand on these thoughts. On the demand side, consumer interest in purchasing a new home remained high throughout the quarter. With few exceptions, demand was strong across all the price points, buyer groups and markets that we serve. The U.S. housing market continues to benefit from favorable demographics, a strong economy, an outstanding job market and a rising wage environment. New home sales are also benefiting from ongoing and significant increases in rental rates for single and multifamily dwellings. According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting, their numbers indicate that rental prices for single-family homes increased by upwards of 5% in 2021, while multifamily lease rates were up by approximately 13% over the prior year. Forecast point to further increases in 2022. Even with today's higher prices and rising rates, owning a home can still make clear economic sense for many consumers. Not only can homebuyers get a comparable or even lower monthly payment, but that payment is more stable over time. Given this demand strength in the first quarter, we were able to raise prices in effectively all of our communities with sequential price increases in the range of 1% to 5% common across the country. In addition to the fundamental strength in homebuyer demand, home price appreciation is benefiting from a lack of available inventory in both new and resale. Similar to buying a new car these days, people who are shopping for a home understand how competitive the market is. This brings me to the supply side of the equation. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, our teams did an outstanding job advancing our homes through the construction process and even surpassed the high end of our closing guidance. I want to recognize the efforts of our homebuilding operations to manage through the constraints and the availability of people and materials that are impacting everything from land entitlement and development to home construction. Depending on the specific market, the availability of labor and materials has at best remain the same, but in certain areas conditions have gotten a little worse and build cycles have gotten longer. Given these challenging conditions, our production time lines extended by about one week in the first quarter and now stand at 145 days to 150 days in most of our divisions. With only a couple of days remaining in April, unless dynamics change dramatically in the next couple of weeks, which does not look likely any improvement in the supply chain would provide a more meaningful benefit to 2023 production. Bob's comments will include us reaffirming our guide for expected 2022 deliveries of 31,000 homes and I would highlight that this guidance assumes that the availability of labor and materials does not change for better or worse. With our production cycles remaining extended, we continue to tightly control sales in most of our communities across the country. We appreciate these restrictions can be frustrating for consumers, but it is the right strategic decisions given overall conditions. From both the customer experience and a business risk perspective, it doesn't make sense to extend our backlog out a year or more just to record another sign up. Even with all of these challenges, I want to highlight that we started almost 9,000 homes in the first quarter and that we now have approximately 5,200 spec homes in production. The majority of these homes are in the initial start and framing stages, but we would expect these houses to deliver in the back half of 2022. As we have noted on prior calls, our spec production is largely focused in our entry level communities. In sum, I think it's fair to say that housing demand remains strong, home prices continue to rise and the supply of new construction homes coming to market is constrained. That being said, the Federal Reserve has been very clear in signaling that interest rates are going higher as they seek to control inflation that has hit 40-year highs. There are a lot of favorable market dynamics that can support ongoing buyer demand in the face of higher rates, but the Fed is intent on slowing down the economy and this certainly has the potential to impact the housing industry. Given this dynamic, it makes sense for us to take actions to position our business for continued success. For now, this means focusing on our land acquisition practices. Internally, we are committed to increasing our option lot position and have set a goal of having 65% to 70% of our future land pipeline controlled under option. Our disciplined land investment process helped us to place some great land positions under control over the past several years and we will be closing on -- that we will be closing on in 2022. Going forward, we will continue our thoughtful approach to investing in the business and we will be prepared to make adjustments in response to changing market conditions. We certainly expect that our land teams can continue to identify tremendous land opportunities, but we want to make sure that only the best projects ultimately get approved. Now let me turn over to Bob for additional comments on our first quarter. Bob? Thanks, Bob. We realized continued strong buyer demand in the first quarter and buyer interest has remained high through April. That being said, a 200-basis-point increase in mortgage rates since the start of the year is likely to have an impact on consumers. Even with the potential for changes in demand, I think the limited supply of available homes means prices can remain high and puts the construction industry in an advantageous position to weather future demand volatility. As we sit here today, the bigger challenge by far isn't getting houses sold, but rather getting them built. That said, it is important that we take actions now to put PulteGroup in the best possible position for continued success. Based on recent field visits and walking numerous job sites, I can personally tell you that our teams are doing an amazing job getting our homes constructed. I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts and I have to highlight the work of our corporate and field-based procurement teams, sourcing even the most basic materials can change from week-to-week, but this group has learned to adapt and find solutions to the most challenging situations. Before opening the call to questions, I would also like to highlight that PulteGroup was again ranked among the 100 Best Companies to Work for by Great Place to Work and Fortune Magazine. We didn't just rank again this year but jumped up 32 positions to number 43 on the list. Being ranked is certainly a nice acknowledgment, but much more important is actually having an amazing and supportive culture that makes PulteGroup a place where people want to be. This is an important competitive advantage when working to attract and retain the most talented individuals. Now let me turn the call back to Jim. Well, actually, I think, it's a fair question. As we highlighted in our prepared remarks, the demand that we saw in the first quarter was exceptionally strong and that's continued into April. To your point, if there is a buyer group that will be more impacted by rising rates, it's certainly the first-time buyer. For -- it's for that reason, among others that we have maintained the importance of our diversified and balanced consumer strategy. We have about 35% of our business that's specifically targeted to entry level. We do tend to play at the higher price points within the entry-level consumer group. So I think it gives us some room to move around. The other piece that we have done here to help with the kind of buying process is most of those homes were starting to specs and we are not releasing them for sale until they are closer to the delivery window, which I think shortens the amount of time that a buyer will be waiting to take delivery of their home in our backlog. We have -- actually, Bob, will give you a little color on that. Thank you. [Inaudible] Yeah. Alan, it's Ryan. I would tell you the land market remains competitive. Certainly, we have other new homebuilders that are buying for the prime parcels and there's other options as well, might it be apartments or other types of users for the land. So I think if you have got a well-located parcel of land, it's competitive, always has been, I think, always likely will be. In terms of kind of what we have seen with more recent optionality. We have pushed from two years ago or three years ago where we were kind of in the 30%s, 30% range in terms of amount of options. Today, we sit at 52%. As you have heard, we are going to push that higher, we have kind of set a goal and a target for ourselves to be in the 65% to 70% range. In terms of your question about, is there potential for things to be re-traded. We are purchasing this year, Alan, I would tell you there's likely no need for that. To your point, there's a lot of embedded value. These are parcels that were put under contract or under control 18 months to 24 months ago and so, they are great deals and we are going to close on them. We are going to be really thoughtful and judicious around what we are underwriting. What we are putting under control now that will be closings in 2023 and 2024. Those are the parcels that, I think, are more susceptible to being tighter in terms of economics that meet our standards and it's part of the reason that we think it's so important that you have got optionality in your land portfolio because it gives you the flexibility to maneuver. Yeah. Mike, it's a great question. I think the biggest reason is inflation. We are in a hyperinflationary environment for all things in the world. And as we had -- as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks to go out and put another buyer in backlog that's not going to be able to close on their home for another year, I don't think it's a great experience for anybody. The consumer doesn't want to wait that long. They are susceptible to all kinds of potential fluctuations in interest rates, which they may or may not be able to handle. And then we have locked in our economics in terms of what we are charging the consumer at the point that we sign the contract. And then we are exposed to a year plus of potential moves in commodity inflation and we just don't think that makes sense for our customer and their experience and it certainly doesn't make sense for economics. So we really like the way the production environment moving. We started almost 9,000 homes in the quarter, which I think demonstrates that we are getting units in the ground. We were able to close homes that were at the high end of our guide, which I think also demonstrates the fact that we are -- we have got pretty good control and predictability around what's in production and so we are actively moving through bringing our backlog down to a level where we can start to release more things for sale and we are certainly looking forward to that. Yeah. Mike, we don't -- I think as you are aware, we don't guide to new orders. So we will stop short of doing that on this call. We are seeing some minor wins in the supply chain and we are having pretty good luck getting homes in the ground. The first quarter is still a quarter where you deal with a fair amount of weather. So to get 9,000 new starts, I think, demonstrates that the supply -- that our production pipeline has moved. So I think it's fair to assume if we can continue at that rate, that you will start to see some restrictions lifted on the way we are releasing lots and releasing homes for potential sale over the balance of the year. We are reaffirming our guide or we did reaffirm our guide of 31,000 closings for the year and that assumes that the kind of supply chain environment kind of stays about like it is right now. Yeah. Hey, Mike. Good morning. This is Ryan. Good question. And the sales pace throughout the quarter was incredibly consistent, because we were controlling it. So we set a rate that we were willing to sell at and so you saw a very similar performance January to February, February to March. Ordinarily, you would actually, I think, in a -- given it's the spring selling season, you would see sales orders build through the quarter and we just didn't let that this year. Discounts are non-existent. We were less than 1% in the quarter, which is down from where it was in the same quarter last year. And price increases remained on a fairly consistent predictable cadence with what we have been over the past six months to nine months. So I think the short answer is, the market is still healthy, demand is still strong, there are more buyers out there than we are able to build homes for right now. Thanks, Mike. Well, I think, it's difficult to compare periods of rising rates, because of the factors that are driving those rising rates are so different. And we happen to be in an inflationary environment with an economy that is continuing to run pretty hot. We are seeing real wage growth. We are seeing a low unemployment environment and there's a real shortage of supply. So there -- the other thing that I think its work highlighting, in this rate environment is the impact of the pandemic and so I think trying to compare to rising rate environment, well, I am sure, you can do it. I think the conclusion will drop will likely not be terrible informative. Yeah. So it will take some time. It will be probably the next two plus years that you will see us progressively move there. But history is guide, I think, when we have laid targets like this out for our operating team. And frankly, we shared it with the investment community we have executive against it. We certainly think that we do that here as well, which give us the reason that gives us that we have got confidence to kind of put that target out there. I think it's very doable. There are number of ways in which will effectuate moving from where we sit today to higher level of optionality, some of that will done with directly with the land sellers. We think that's arguably the best way to do it. Sometimes we will work with development partners that are actually putting finished lots on the ground for us and there are some other alternative arrangements that you can use to get optionality in the land book as well. So I think you should expect us to probably use a mix of all of those things as we move to more optionality. We think it's got a lot of benefits in terms of managing risk. But certainly very capital efficient, it helps to drive returns to a better place and we will use that in cash flow for some of the things that Bob highlighted a minute ago, including share repurchases. Yeah. John, good morning. Thanks for the question. On the community count side, we are dragging a little bit from where we would optimally have liked to have been and it's mostly around entitlement delays with municipalities. It's always been hard and it's taken a long time to get through the entitlement process. I would tell you, cities and city councils and planning and zoning boards, while I think most are back and working, it's just simply taking longer. So really nothing there that I would highlight other than it's taken us a few months longer than ideal. In terms of kind of the supply environment, we are operating under the assumption that things are going to continue to remain hard for the balance of 2022, which means we are -- that's why we have reaffirmed the guide that we gave. I will take you back to the commentary that we gave at the end of Q4, our assumption was that 2022 is going to remain a very difficult supply chain year and we are still there. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, John, if we are to see some improvement and I'd like optimistically, I think, we have got to start turning the corner soon. That's mostly going to benefit our 2023 production. We are clearly not there yet in terms of kind of giving guidance. And then, finally, in terms of kind of new orders and more communities and less sales restrictions. I think that all can be interpreted as a positive for the future. But we don't give forward guidance in terms of orders. So we will -- while we are optimistic, we will report the news when we get there. It's very similar. Not a lot of change. It was a strong quarter and pretty similar to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 of last year. Yeah. Stephen, that's exactly right. Buyers that are purchasing today or purchased in the first quarter, we qualified them at the rate when they applied for a mortgage. It's part of the reason that Bob touched on, the comment that we made about stress testing our backlog, those buyers would have qualified at whatever rate was there in a prior period. And largely, those buyers are still able to qualify and for the ones that are maybe a little tighter. We have got programs and things that we can do to help get them over the hump. But to your question, Stephen, and I think the most important thing is, yeah, the buyers that are signing up today are qualifying in today's rate environment. And the reason that they are locking or doing longer rate locks is because they are making the trade between the cost of that forward longer term rate lock against the volatility that they think might play out in the interest rate environment. Yeah. Stephen, there are certainly kind of one-off scenarios where we have to work through some kind of a challenging situation with the consumer. We pride ourselves on outstanding customer experience and doing the right thing for the consumer, which by and large, I think, we do always. The buyers that are in backlog have got tremendous backlog -- tremendous equity built up based on when they purchased. They are excited to close and so there's not really a need for a lot of negotiation at the closing table. They want to be in their homes. They have got tremendous value built up. They are closing. So the -- the gross margin guide that we have given incorporates all of the information that we have, and kind of what we would expect to play out over the coming quarters and the balance of the year and it's a healthy gross margin, as I think, you can probably appreciate. Yeah. Stephen, that's fair. Well, look, we are slightly on the high end and so high end of our guide, which we are thrilled with. I think it's more a testament to the strength of our operations team, our construction team that really work incredibly hard to deliver homes in a tough environment and it's hard out there. I think we have done a better job based on being in this environment now for a year, probably, going on almost two years that we have probably got better forecasting methodologies and assuming how and how quickly things are going to move through the cycle. But it continues to be tough out there, but that's not taking anything away from our construction team that I think really knocked it out of the park. And to your first question on are there particular supplies? No. I think it's consistent across buyer groups and it's kind of the same commodities, the same items that continue to see constrained things that involve microchips are hard to come by. There are some commodities, some lumber components that are difficult for sure. So, but in terms of differences between buyer groups, I wouldn't highlight anything. As for kind of are there consumer segments where we could take share. I would tell you, we are looking to grow our company across the Board. Our mix of business today is exactly where we want it positioned and so as we look to grow the company, we will look to do it equally across all consumer segments. I'd highlight that our Del Webb brand remains the most recognized and powerful brand within the active Adult Consumer Group. And so we like what we are able to do there. Similarly, we like the gains that we have made in the entry level consumer space with our Centex product, which that product is mostly being sold or started as a spec home and sold just prior to the home being finished. Yeah. Carl, I think, to your point, traffic is not as good an indicator of the strength of the market as maybe what it used to be. Most of our communities don't have available inventory that you can buy off the lot, so to speak. So some of the things that we are really paying attention to today is the traffic to our website, virtual visits, in addition to the customers that actually come into the stores or the model parks physically. So it's important, trust me, we pay attention to it, it's something that I watch on a weekly basis, what's going on with our traffic. But it is a little bit different right now compared to how it used to be. The difference maybe between now and pre-pandemic is the virtual traffic, which is ridiculously strong compared to maybe a prior cycle. I don't have those numbers. Does that walk-in, Carl, you were asking... Yeah."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan highlighted, the year has gotten off to an excellent start as home sale revenues in the first quarter were up 18% over last year to $3.1 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by an 18% increase in average sales price to $508,000, while closings of 6,039 homes were consistent with last year. The higher ASP for the period was driven by double-digit gains in pricing within our first-time move-up and active adult fire groups. By buyer group, our mix of closings for the first quarter was also consistent with last year, as we made -- we remain well balanced across the primary buyer groups. In the quarter, 35% of buyers were first time, 40% were move-up and 25% were active adult. In the comparable prior year period, the breakdown was 33% first-time, 44%, move-up and 23%, active adult. In the first quarter, we recorded net new orders of 7,971 homes, which is down 19% from last year. Lower orders for the quarter were primarily the 7% decrease in community count, combined with the impact of aggressively controlling sales paces, given ongoing disruptions in the supply chain. As has been the case for the past several quarters, we continue to restrict sales in many communities in order to align sales with current production pace. Looking more closely at our order activity, orders to first-time buyers decreased 13% to 2,710 homes, while orders to move up buyers were lower by 22% to 3,341 homes and active adult orders declined 23% to 1,920 homes. The relative outperformance among first-time buyers is due to the availability of the spec production we started in the back half of 2021 that supported some incremental orders. Between delays in municipal approvals and extended land development time lines, it is taking longer for some communities to open for sale. As a result, in addition to being down from the prior year, our first quarter average community count of 777 was slightly below our previous guidance. We expect the modest drag in the community openings that we experienced in the first quarter to continue for the remainder of the year. As such, we now expect that our average community count in the second quarter will be 780, with growth to 800 in the third quarter and 830 in the fourth quarter. Reflective of the strength -- strong demand conditions we experienced in the quarter, our cancellation rate remained exceptionally low at 9%. In total, we ended the first quarter with a unit backlog of 19,935 homes, which is an increase of 5% over last year. The dollar value of our backlog increased 31% to $11.5 billion, which reflects the 5% unit growth combined with a significant year-over-year increase in our ASP and backlog. As Ryan noted, our teams are doing a great job moving homes through the production cycle in light of the challenges the industry is facing and the availability of labor and materials. As a result, we ended the first quarter with 21,269 homes under construction, which is an increase of 44% over last year. This production number includes 5,181 spec homes that are currently in the pipeline, which is almost triple our spec units at this time last year. At quarter end, specs were 24% of units under production as we continue to make steady progress toward our goal of 25% to 30%. Our overall production pipeline is still early in the construction process as 28% of these homes are at the initial start stage with 43% of the homes at the framing stage. We ended the quarter with only 64 finished specs, which is consistent with our comments that homes made available for sale sell quickly. Based on the universe of homes in production, as well as their stage of construction, we currently expect to deliver between 7,200 and 7,600 homes in the second quarter. Again, assuming no significant improvement or erosion in the availability of labor and/or materials, we still expect to deliver 31,000 homes for the year, which would be an increase of 7% over last year. On our prior earnings call, we noted that, given supply constraints and limited opportunity to meaningfully increase construction pace, we would rely on price as the bigger lever to maximize return. Looking at the dollar value of our backlog and new orders, you can see that this is what has occurred. Based on the average price in backlog and the mix of homes we expect to deliver, we expect our second quarter closings to have an ASP in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. Inclusive of the $508,000 average sales price realized in Q1 and the first-time spec homes we expect to deliver in the back half of the year, we now expect our average sales price for the full year to also be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. As we always highlight, the final mix of deliveries can influence the average sales price we realized in any given quarter. Given the ongoing strong demand conditions, we have been able to increase sales prices sufficiently to offset rising costs and to further expand our gross margin. In the first quarter, homebuilding gross margin was 29%, which is an increase of 350 basis points over the first quarter of last year and is up 220 basis points sequentially. In addition to the strong demand and pricing environment, our Q1 deliveries also benefited from the flow-through of lower cost lumber, as prices for wood products rolled over in the back half of last year. Until a recent pullback, lumber prices had moved significantly higher since the beginning of the year, which will impact our closings in the back half of this year. Beyond lumber, we are continuing to see meaningful inflation in most materials and labor costs. As such, even with the recent pullback in lumber, we expect house cost inflation exclusive of land cost to be in the range of 10% to 12% for the full year. Based on the strength of recent selling conditions and despite the volatility in the materials and labor market, we now expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.5% to 30% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year. Given the timing and impact of lumber and other input costs, we expect to be towards the higher end of this range in Q2, but likely toward the end -- lower end of the range in the third and fourth quarters. As always, there are a lot of moving pieces, so we will update you on our gross margin guidance if needed as we move through the year. Our SG&A expense in the first quarter was $329 million or 10.7% of home sale revenues, which is in line with our earlier guidance. In the comparable prior year period, our reported SG&A expense of $272 million or 10.5% of home sale revenues included a pretax insurance benefit of $10 million. Exclusive of that benefit, our adjusted SG&A expense was $282 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Given expected homebuilding revenues for the coming quarters, we currently expect SG&A expense in the second quarter to be in the range of 9.4% to 9.6%, which would be a 30-basis-point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint. For the full year, we now expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. First quarter pretax income for our financial services operations was $41 million, compared with prior year pretax income of $66 million. Lower pretax income for the current period is reflective of a much more competitive market conditions which negatively impacted our capture rate and overall profitability per loan. Mortgage capture rate for the quarter was 81%, down from 88% last year. Our reported tax expense for the first quarter was $145 million for an effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our effective tax rate in the period was lower than our recent guidance. We recorded benefits related to equity compensation in the quarter. Looking ahead, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in each quarter over the balance of the year. Our reported net income for the first quarter was $454 million or $1.83 per share. In the comparable prior year period, our reported net income was $304 million or $1.13 per share, while adjusted net income was $343 million or $1.28 per share. In the first quarter, the company repurchased 10.3 million common shares or approximately 4% of the shares outstanding at the end of 2021 at an average price of $48.59. Relative to the first quarter of last year, our share count is down by almost 10%. In addition to allocating $500 million to share repurchases in the first quarter, we invested $1.1 billion of land acquisition and development. This keeps us on track to achieve our prior guidance of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of land spend for the full year, with more than 50% of that spend being for development of existing land assets. Inclusive of our first quarter spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 52% were held under option. Our strong land pipeline provides us with the lot need to grow our business, while allowing us to focus future investment on projects that meet our underwriting standards. Even after allocating approximately $1.6 billion to investment in the business and share repurchases, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 21.5%. It's worth mentioning here that as highlighted in this morning's earnings release, Moody's Investors Service recently noted the strength of our operations and overall financial position when they upgraded PulteGroup's senior unsecured ratings from Baa2 -- to Baa2 from Baa3. As Ryan discussed, given the Federal Reserve comments that we were in for a period of rising rates, we are acutely focused on ways to mitigate land related risk. In recent years, we have established a land pipeline that can support the ongoing growth of our operations, but provides optionality should demand conditions change in the future. Going forward, we will continue to emphasize the use of lot options or comparable structures to control rather than own positions and we are actively working to increase our percentage of option lots within our land portfolio. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yeah. I think we are always obviously in close contact with our backlog. We have seen people taking a longer rate lock position and so we have highlighted that an increase in rates is a single-digit -- 100-basis-point rate increases a single-digit, perhaps, impact on our backlog. It's interesting, most of the folks that are there have significant equity built up in their house and so they have expressed that they want to close. And so we have lots of different ways that we can help people get there, whether it's to source additional income, if they have some additional down payment different programs. So the backlog is pretty solid, and obviously, people have changed in circumstances we work with them as best we can to try to get them to closing table. Yeah. Alan, it's -- I think a way to think about it is pre- and post-pandemic, just to be simple and we would tell you that half of it is pre and half of its post. Obviously, we put things under control, oftentimes a fair amount of time in advance of when we actually take the lots down and so owned versus option plays into that. On balance, it's usually taken us 12 months to 24 months to get from contract to getting communities open. So I don't know if that gets you there, but roughly 50% is pre-pandemic or two years to three years ago. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty consistent with history at about 3% to 5%, Alan. We don't have much of that at this point. Those closings are coming next year. Yeah. Yeah. And to your question on option and lot premium spend. It was almost $100,000 a unit in the most -- in this print. That's up 23%, which I think reflects the strength of the market. And you can -- we don't provide that level of detail on our -- on the orders we have taken, but you can see from the average sales prices being up, we are not seeing much change on that at all. Yeah. Mike, I wouldn't want to speculate on actual owned lots at any one point in time. I think we are trying to grow the business to do that. You have to have lots on the ground. You have to develop them. Some of it will depend on whether we are buying raw that we are self-developing or if we have arrangements that provide us finished lots. So there's a lot of things that will influence that. In terms of what that does ultimately to our capital allocation, I think, you have seen us, as we have driven that option percentage higher, we have been generating a significant amount of cash and we have been using that cash to continue to invest in the business and to buy back stock. You saw that we obviously bought back a lot of stock this quarter. Our lens on that doesn't change, right? So, if we have excess capital and if that's being generated by a more efficient balance sheet, we will evaluate the needs for that capital and one of those is going to be share repurchases. So I think at the end of the day, it does a couple of things for us. One, it provides us some flexibility and protection from market risk. It yields higher returns and it yields higher free cash that we would use, again, consistently with what we have done over the past 10 years. Yeah. Truman, I don't -- not really, right? I mean, the market, I think, is pretty efficient. We have not seen a reduction in desire. So if we are talking to folks, there is money available. The question for us has always been, can we make the economics make sense and you have seen things tighten a little bit, which is good. For us, again, the goal is to try and create a transaction that yields us an acceptable return and gives us some flexibility and I don't think that the market has changed appreciably. We are trying to broaden relationships. We are talking to different folks. We still probably start at if it's a land seller trying to work out a deal with them first. What we are really doing now is saying, okay, if they are not willing to do some sort of option, does it make sense to put a third party between us and the dirt before we close. More to come on that to Ryan's point. It will take some time. But we are working through it. Yeah. To the latter one, we always seek a fair deposit and we are continuing to do that today. In terms of working with our consumers, we still enjoy a very robust capture rate. We do offer. We think attractive rate lock programs. We have seen people go out a little bit longer. They are locking a little bit earlier. And we are encouraging them to do that, because the rate environment is going to move, it seems and has moved against them. So we have seen, in particular, the sort of the 60-day rate lock environment, which is when people are getting closing dates typically. We have seen a lot of people participating in that. Yeah. That goes to the individual, candidly. We offer it. We have got long rate locks. But it gets expensive, Truman. So they are... ... great for the consumer. Thanks, Truman. Yeah. It's interesting, because of everything Ryan just said, that is relative to pre-pandemic good, but declining a little bit and mostly because I think people know there's no inventory to look at. So they are not coming into the stores often but they are still searching for homes and literally and figuratively. Many places have such limited lot releases that there's not anything to go look at."

I would now like to welcome Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin the call. Jim, over to you.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, Mandeep. Good morning, and let me welcome participants to today\u2019s call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup\u2019s strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results, the period ended December 31, 2203. I\u2019m joined on today\u2019s call by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO, Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides, have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll post an audio replay of this call later today. . Please note that consistent with this morning's earnings release, we'll be discussing our debt ratio on both a gross and net basis. A reconciliation of our adjusted results to our reported financials is included in this morning's release and within today's webcast slides. And finally, I want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Over the past few years, we have faced macro challenges ranging from COVID, to supply chain disruptions, to skyrocketing mortgage rates. Through it all, we've remained disciplined and consistent in running our operations, but when needed, have quickly adjusted key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success. The benefits of this approach can be seen in the strength of our reported results. Bob will detail our Q4 performance, so let me highlight several of our key operating and financial achievements for the full year of 2023. By strategically increasing our spec production, we had more inventory available to meet the demand of first time home buyers and those consumers worried about mortgage rate volatility. Increased house inventory was a critical support to PulteGroup delivering 28,600 homes in 2023, and record home sale revenues of $15.6 billion. In the face of increased costs for land, labor, and materials, we carefully managed product offerings, pricing, incentives, and absorption paces to maintain high profitability, while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. The result, we reported outstanding full-year gross margins of 29.3%, which helped drive a 6% increase in earnings per share to a record $11.72 per share, and a 27% return on equity. We also continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline as we completed transactions to put approximately 40,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, 53% of our total land pipeline is under option, either with the land sellers or through our expanding land banking structures. Since making the decision to expand our use of land banking starting 15 months ago, we have placed approximately 25 communities representing $1.5 billion worth of future land and development spend into such structures. And finally, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $4.3 billion into the business through land acquisition and development spend in 2023, and returned $1.2 billion to investors through share repurchases, dividends, and debt paydown. Inclusive of our 2023 spend, we have repurchased almost half of the 2013 shares outstanding since initiating the program over a decade ago.  By remaining consistent in our business practices and making market-responsive adjustments were needed, we reported another year of exceptional financial results. I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their tireless efforts and support in delivering superior homes and experiences to our home buyers, while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors. Consistent with the broader housing market, we saw homebuying demand being negatively impacted during the early part of the fourth quarter, as 30-year mortgage rates increase toward their 2023 peak of 8%. We then saw buyer sentiment and demand improved, as mortgage rates finally rolled over, ultimately dropping more than 100 basis points as we moved through November and December. The decline in rates helped drive our December net new orders and absorption pace to be the highest month in the quarter. The increased homebuying activity in December was an important driver of the 57% increase in our Q4 net new orders, and demonstrates the desire for home ownership remains high across all buyer groups. It remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is extremely positive. A structural shortage of housing caused by years of underbuilding has only been exacerbated by a lack of resale inventory as owners are financially and/or emotionally locked into their low rate mortgages. While the lack of existing home inventory will resolve itself over time, we believe that land entitlement and labor availability challenges mean it will be difficult to correct for the many years of underbuilding in this country. Given our constructive views on the outlook for housing demand, we are investing in our operations, with the goal of growing unit volumes by 5% to 10% annually. Our decision to walk away from option locks as interest rates increased in 2022, will impact our community openings in 2024, leading to our growth this year being closer to the lower end of this range, as we expect closings of approximately 30,000 homes in 2024.  For those of you who have followed PulteGroup\u2019s story for the past few years, you know it's never been about growth for growth's sake. Our focus is always on investing in our business to build shareholder value. So, our objective is to grow our volumes while maintaining high returns on equity. To accomplish this, we must continue to intelligently invest in high quality and high returning projects, while continuing to invest in our own assets through the ongoing repurchase of our stock. As we have demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend, and return excess capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy, and conditions in the job market to remain favorable, there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years.  Let me now turn over the call to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob?\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning. As Ryan mentioned in his comments, market conditions changed meaningfully as the fourth quarter progressed and as mortgage rates began to fall. Our reported financial results for the period were influenced by these evolving market dynamics, so I'll note any important areas of impact in my prepared remarks. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.2 billion, compared with $5 billion in the prior year. Our lower home sale revenues for the period primarily reflect a 14% decrease in closings to 7,615 homes, along with a 2% decrease in our average sales price to $547,000. I would highlight that our fourth quarter closings came in about 5% below our previous guide, as sales early in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and the general softening in overall buyer demand. As Ryan noted, homebuying demand accelerated in the back half of the quarter, but sales, particularly sales of finished spec homes that would close in the quarter, finished below our assumptions. We could have captured incremental sales and closing value by offering higher incentives, but we didn't see that as a worthwhile tradeoff. Given that buyer trends have remained positive in January, I think we made the right choices as we have inventory available to meet the stronger demand.  Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised 40% first time, 36% move-up, and 24% active adult, which is in alignment with our stated goal for the buyer mix for our business. In the fourth quarter of 2022, closings were 36% first time, 39% move-up, and 25% active adult. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 919, which represents an 8% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 850 communities, and was in line with our prior guidance. Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders increased 57% over last year to 6,214 homes. The large increase over last year reflects both improved demand in 2023, as well as the extremely difficult operating environment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As discussed previously, demand conditions grew increasingly difficult early in the fourth quarter this year as mortgage rates climbed to 8%, but we experienced a notable improvement in buying activity as rates decreased over the back half of the quarter. On a sequential basis, our absorption pace improved from November to December, and we would attribute much of this improvement to the decline in interest rates. Along with stronger demand conditions, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net new orders benefited from a decrease in cancellation rates. In the most recent quarter, cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog fell to 9%, down from 11% in the comparable prior year period. Looking at our order activity by buyer group, fourth quarter net new orders increased 70% for first time buyers, 78% for move-up buyers, and 15% for active adult buyers. Our order numbers indicate that demand improved across all buyer groups, which is a very positive dynamic when assessing potential housing demand in 2024. As a result of our sales and closing activity, our quarter end backlog was 12,146 homes, which is effectively flat with last year. Reflective of the increased mix of first-time buyers and their lower average sales prices, our ending backlog value declined slightly to $7.3 billion. Inclusive of the 7,128 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,889 homes in production. 44% of our production is spec, including 1,263 finished specs, which puts us in a strong position to meet buyer demand as we head into the spring selling season. By the end of the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time was down to 130 days, which is a sequential improvement of about two weeks from the end of the third quarter. Going forward, we continue to target getting our cycle time down to 100 days or below by the end of the year. Based on our production pipeline, we expect closings in the first quarter of 2024 to be between 6,200 and 6,600 homes. And given our units under production, we expect full-year deliveries to grow by 5% to 30,000 homes. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to remain in the range of $540 million to $550,000 for the first quarter and the full year of 2024, which is consistent with our fourth quarter pricing. At the midpoint, this would imply price stability over the course of the year. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 28.9%, which is down approximately 50 basis points from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year, but likely remains the industry leader among the big builders. As with the entire year, our fourth quarter margins reflect higher incentive and input costs. Incentives, which primarily impact revenues, increased 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 6.5%. On the cost side, lower lumber prices offset inflation and other material and labor, but higher land and land development costs impacted margins in the period. Given my prior comments that we expect pricing to be flat in 2024, we anticipate that land and house cost inflation will result in gross margins to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% for each quarter during the year.  We reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $308 billion, or 7.4% of home sale revenues, compared with prior year SG&A expense of $351 million, or 7.1%. The 30-basis point drop in overhead leverage can be attributed to the lower closings and revenues realized in the quarter versus the prior year. It should be noted that we recorded $65 billion of pre-tax insurance benefit in the fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022. Based on anticipated closing volumes, we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Given our typical seasonality of closings, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be approximately 10% of home sale revenues, with overhead leverage improving as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.  For the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $44 million, which is up from $24 million last year. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects more favorable market conditions across our financial services platform, coupled with higher capture rates, including an increase to 85%, up from 75% last year in our mortgage operations. Our reported pre-tax income for the most recent quarter was $947, million compared with prior year pre-tax income of $1.2 billion. In the period, we recorded tax expense of $236 million for an effective tax rate of 24.9%. Projecting ahead to 2024, we expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Looking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $882 million, or $3.85 per share. For the full year of 2023, we reported net income of $2.6 billion and a record earnings of $11.72 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, in 2023 we generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion. Given our current expectations for operating and financial results, along with our plans to increase land investment to $5 billion in the coming year, we expect 2024 cash flows from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion.  Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, of which 59% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $4.3 billion, of which 59% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer term housing dynamics, as noted, our plan is to increase our land spend to approximately $5 billion in 2024. We would again anticipate a roughly 60/40 split between development and land acquisition. This increase in investment is consistent with Ryan's earlier comments regarding positioning the business to routinely grow future delivery volumes by 5% to 10% per year. Inclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended 2023 with 223,000 lots under control, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our owned lot count by 4,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by roughly 16,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased to 53%, up from 48% last year. There's still a lot of runway ahead of us to achieve our goal of 70% option lots, but we're moving in the right direction.  Based on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings in 2024, we expect our average community count in 2024 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we continue to return capital to shareholders in 2023. To that end, we paid out $142 million in dividends, and have increased our dividend per share by 25%, starting in the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 13.8 billion common shares at a cost of $1 billion for an average price of $72.50 per share, which included $300 million of repurchases at an average price of $83.03 per share in the fourth quarter. With the 13.8 billion shares acquired in 2023, we have repurchased approximately half of the shares outstanding at the time we initiated the program back in 2013. Having repurchased these shares at an average cost of $32.16 per share, we believe it's been a great investment for our shareholders. In addition to buying our stock, in the fourth quarter we took advantage of market conditions by using $35 billion of cash on hand to pay down a portion of our debt. For all of 2023, we retired $101 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions, helping to lower our quarter end debt to capital ratio to 15.9%, down 280 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we ended the year with a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%.  Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. \nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. Successfully navigating our business through the past 12 months of rising interest rates has been challenging. The same could be said about the past 24, 36, and 48-month periods as we battled through COVID and the global collapse in supply chains. I am extremely proud of how our entire team responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over an unprecedented period. Looking back over the five-year period of 2019 to the just recently completed 2023, we grew volumes 5% annually and delivered just under 135,000 homes. To support our growth during this period and for future years, we invested almost $19 billion in cumulative land acquisition and development spend. Through our disciplined land investment, operational focus, and organizational expertise, we capitalized on market conditions to grow earnings per share over this period at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, while delivering an average annual return on equity of just over 26%. It's this type of strong financial performance during an extended period of market volatility that has prompted increased discussion about the need to reconsider how the large homebuilders are valued. I think that if you want to be valued differently, you must demonstrate a fundamental change in how you operate the business and the results you deliver, not just for a year or two, but over an extended period of time. What's different about the past five years is that while investing $19 billion into our operation, we also generated almost $7 billion in net cash flow from operations during the sustained period of growth. In fact, we recorded only one year of negative cash flow from operations since shifting our focus in 2012 from just topline growth, to driving high returns over the housing cycle. We paid off $1.1 billion of debt, while cutting our leverage by more than half, to end 2023 with a debt to capital ratio of 15.9%, and a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I'd add that the reality is, we've been operating our business in just this way for really the past 10 years. I know stocks reflect performance, so I believe that if we can continue to both grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders, while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low risk profile, that our stock price and shareholders will ultimately be rewarded.  Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So, Mandeep, if you would explain the process, we'll get started.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Morning, guys. Hope you're doing well. Ryan, I wanted to ask a little bit more about January. Could you maybe expand on how business has been, and what I'm really interested in is, have you seen enough traffic or sales rates to start to think about more broadly pulling incentives down or even starting to raise base across the footprint?\nRyan Marshall: Carl, so Bob highlighted in the prepared remarks that we - specifically in Q4, October, November, were really below expectations, and it was driven by high rates. We had a great December, highest month in the quarter in terms of absolute sales and absorptions per community. So, that was certainly an anomaly for typical December seasonal patterns. And the strength has really continued into January, Carl. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the year is starting. In terms of kind of where it sets us up for reduced discounts, increased prices, we're going to watch it closely, and I think we've demonstrated through past behavior that we're always looking to find the sweet spot between pace and price. It won't come as a surprise to you, Carl, that affordability with the buyers remains a challenge. And so, I think we're going to have to be thoughtful about what we do on both the incentive and the price increase front, but we're feeling pretty good about how the year started.\nCarl Reichardt: All right. Thanks for that, Ryan. And then I'm going to ask a couple of questions just on move-up. Obviously, the entry level business has been strong for volumes. Move-up, a number of your peers have kind of shifted some of their investments more towards the low end. That's been going on for quite some time. Can you talk a little bit about how that - how you look at that business this year? Is there any alteration in mix in terms of communities and whether or not maybe your CAN rate in that business is improving faster than the other businesses? We're trying to see if the existing housing market's unlocking enough that you can start to see even more strength in that particular segment. Thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Carl, our move-up business performed incredibly well in the quarter. We had, on a year-over-year basis, the growth was north of 70%. So, I think that segment performed very well. The margins out of our move-up, as well as our Del Webb business continue to be some of our best gross margins. So, we're seeing real financial strength there also. And then in terms of kind of community mix, Carl, we're kind of right in line with where our long-term strategic targets are in terms of kind of that part of our business being about 35% of our overall mix. So, we feel pretty good about where that business is positioned. \nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, just maybe another point of clarification that not only were the sales strong, it was our strongest absorptions on a same-store basis. So, that consumer actually has performed well, to Ryan's point, strong margins and absorptions.\nCarl Reichardt: Thank you, Bob. Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the details and for taking the questions. Question on the high-level growth algorithm that you gave, Ryan, around the kind of 5% to 10% growth annually. Talking the low end of that this year because you walked away from some deals in 2022. So, my question is, is this kind of sort of a one-year hold, so to speak, and do you have the lands that you need today to kind of get back to your algorithm by 2025? Or how should we think about getting to that level of growth going forward? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. We feel really good about how we position the land pipeline. We've been investing for growth for a number of years, and we've been trying to do it in a very responsible way specific to having less owned and more optioned land. The fact that over the last 15 months we've made significant headway with our land banking platform, has helped with that. So, we really like the number of lots that we have under control at 225,000 plus or minus. And we like the ownership structure, or the way that we or the way that we've controlled those lands. We think it's a really capital-efficient structure. Specific to your growth target number, yes, we\u2019re going to be at the lower end for 2024. Beyond that, we feel that we've got the right structure to kind of be in that range for future periods. \nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, maybe I'd add to that, the land for 2025 is under contract and probably in development right now. And so, we have line of sight to 2024, 2025, even up to 2026. We're still working through some of that, but we've - you can see from the approvals that we've did in this most recent quarter or for the year, 40,000 lots, no issues from our perspective in terms of lining up that type of growth rate.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Thanks, guys. Second one, back to the gross margin question, I think you're guiding 2024 margins to be down at roughly 70 basis points from where you exited the fourth quarter. I think I heard you say, Bob, that it's kind of flat pricing and then you've got some headwinds in land, labor, and materials. I'm just curious if you kind of unpack that a little bit and maybe specifically focus on the land side, how are you kind of thinking about those headwinds to the margin, and how does that kind of play into that guide in 2024? Thank you.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, fair question, and I think we laid it out this way. To try and answer that question, I'll give you a little more color. We see pricing flat during the year. Now, you might see different pricing at different consumer groups. The first time is the most affordability challenge, and that's where we saw actually the biggest decline in the current quarter. But we think pricing is relatively flat through 2024. We see modest, call it, 2% to 4% house construction cost increases kind of mid to upper single-digit land increases, which is what we've experienced this year. And so, when you kind of mix that all together - the one other point I guess I'd offer to clarify is, we're assuming incentive loads stay about the same at the 6.5% that we saw in this quarter. So, when you marry that all up together, a little bit of a decline year-over-year, but still 28% to 28.5%, pretty strong margin performance.\nMatthew Bouley: Perfect. All right, thanks, Bob. Thanks, Ryan. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line at John Lovallo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lovallo: Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just maybe talking about January again, curious how orders looked versus normal seasonality, if you will. And I think first quarter absorptions typically rise, call it, 40% to 45% sequentially. Is there anything that would preclude that from happening in your opinion outside of rates maybe in the first quarter of this year?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, John, we didn't give a specific increase out of December. We kept more of our commentary around the qualitative side of things, which I'd reiterate, we're very pleased with how things are performing in January, and we'd expect that strength to continue. So, we continue to be in a situation where there's low supply. Affordability has definitely gotten better. You heard Bob's comment about kind of what we've assumed with our incentive load. So, yes, I'd expect us to have a strong Q1. The one thing - other thing I'd offer that's probably of note is we're starting to see some real signs of life in our western markets. Those have been - that's been a part of the country that was slow for the majority of kind of 2022 and most all of 2023. But in the last 30 to 45 days, we\u2019re really starting to see those markets pick up, which is a welcomed outcome.\nJohn Lovallo: Makes sense. And then on the share buyback, that was encouraging to see, and I think could be a good driver of returns as we move forward here, over the past few years, I think you guys have done about $1 billion per year. The authorization now is closer to $1.8 billion. How are you thinking about 2024 buybacks relative to the past few years? I mean, should we expect north of a billion?\nRyan Marshall: Honestly, I'm going to defer. We typically do - we report the news on that. I think you highlight, we've done about $1 billion a year the last couple of years. We have $.8 billion in cash. We have offered that we project about $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations in the current year. So, our capital allocation priorities don't change. We've said we're going to increase our land investment to $5 billion. That's up about 16% year-over-year. We increased our dividend 25%. That's not a huge cash element, but still, I think reflective of our confidence in the business. We do have $.8 billion of authorization. And like I said, we'll report the news. You saw this year we bought back $100 million of our notes because it was attractive. The rate environment has made that a little less attractive, but we always look at liability management as part of the equation. So, really no change to our capital allocation priorities.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much, guys. First question relates to your land on the balance sheet. I think that your cashflow guide seems to suggest, at least for my modeling, a modest rise in your own lot count, while you keep a year supply of owned lots fairly stable. I was wondering if that's right, and if there's any opportunity or desire to actually reduce your land holdings in years further.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, so a couple things there. We are increasing our land spend in 2024 from $4.3 billion to $5 billion. Our mix of developed spend versus land acquisition spend will continue to probably be about 60% development, 40% land acq. And then our long-term desire is to have 70% of our land control via option. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, this year we moved that from 48% option to 53% controlled via option. So, we're - I think both in - we demonstrated through results over the past number of years as well as kind of articulated long-term goals, we want to be land lighter. We're going to continue to do it the right way, all with an eye toward delivering a lower risk model that's very capital-efficient as well.\nStephen Kim: Well, I guess, Ryan, I mean, you gave most of that information in your opening remarks, so I appreciate that. But I guess the gist of my question, trying to incrementally understand what your plans are a little bit more is to try to understand the actual amount of owned lots. Are you looking to get to your 70% option versus owned mix by keeping your owned lot count kind of flat, or your supply flat with where you are, or are you actually looking to reduce that in addition to increasing your option lot exposure to kind of get to that 70% eventually?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Stephen, in terms of years owned, we'd expect to probably keep that right around the level that we're at, maybe a slight decrease. And then ultimately, we would start to flip from a years owned to years option. You'll see a little bit of a trade in that mix.\nStephen Kim: Okay, that helps. And then when you talked about land banking and continuing to increase that, could you describe for us the - when you think generally about what you're seeing in the market in terms of pricing, in terms of the way these negotiations are going with your land bankers, what kind of anticipated haircut to gross margin do you typically get when you go from just sort of buying versus doing a land option? And what's the benefit to your inventory turns that you typically think about? So, what's the tradeoff basically in your mind, some rules of thumb for us?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, I don't know that there's kind of a hard and fast answer to that, Stephen. It depends on the mix of the business that we've got. In terms of margin, it can be a couple of hundred basis points on a relative basis. And in terms of inventory turns, certainly it's going to be more efficient than a bulk raw transaction. But it depends on the life of the asset. So, it in Del Webb, it's going to be very different than it is in the Centex business for us. So, I wouldn't want to paint that with too broad a brush.\nStephen Kim: Okay, that's fine. I appreciate it. That's fine. I appreciate it. Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the assumption on the incentive load in the gross margin guidance. I'm wondering if that represents more just a state of conservatism right now, waiting to see what happens with rates further, or if it's more about your philosophy as rates fall that you might allow that to flow through to affordability and drive volume versus letting it be a big margin benefit. If you could just talk about that tradeoff.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Joe, we've - I think the reason we've assumed that the incentive load stays about where it is just because affordability continues to be challenged. So, we've got low supply but interest rates are relatively higher. And because of low supply, I think there's still some pressure on prices being elevated historically. So, we talked a lot in 2023 about how successful we were in helping to solve some of the affordability challenges with the incentive dollars that we put toward the forward mortgage commitments. We'll continue to use that as a tool in 2024. Now, as rates fall, we think the cost of those forwards mortgage rate commitments will become less. We've made an assumption that we reallocate some of those incentive dollars to other things that help to solve the affordability challenge and get a buyer into their home. So, is it conservative? Time will tell. I think what you've seen from us historically is, we're not afraid to raise price. We're not afraid to cut discounts, and we're always looking to optimize pace and price. You've also heard me talk the last several quarters, we're not going to be margin proud. So, we\u2019re doing things to be responsive to what the market is, to derive an outcome that yields the best return for our shareholders. And you'll see us actively managing all things, pace, price, incentives, forward, more forward mortgage commitments, et cetera.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Understood. Thanks a lot for that. And I appreciate your comments about the valuation. Sounds like you think that cashflow is a bigger part of that potentially even than just percentage of option lots or any metric on the land side about the cash flow. I tend to agree. And so, just wondering if you are internally starting to think about your leverage in the context of cash flow or profits, and not so much on what it makes up relative to your inventory balance. It's kind of thinking almost more like a manufacturer or distributor, because right now you're net debt is at about 13 days of operating profits. Just thinking about the potential for using more debt going forward. Thanks.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, that's an interesting question. I'm not sure we can think like a manufacturing company completely. The risk profiles are different. But having said that, I think there are - based on the strength of the operation, based on the cash flow that we've consistently shown despite growth, which historically is not the way this industry has behaved, we believe there is an opportunity for people to think a little bit differently about the equity. In terms of how we manage the leverage on the balance sheet, a lot of that will have to do with our opportunities to invest in the business and what we do on the share repurchases. But even you look at the rating agencies, they've been slow, but they've been responsive to kind of I think seeing the value in the business model and also the way the debt gets looked at. So, would we use more debt for something? Without question, if it were for the right thing.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: That's helpful, Bob. Thanks so much. Take care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Appreciate it. wanted to circle back just on incentives and where we are today and to the extent that there's the potential for those to decline, how we should think about the impact on 2024. So, when you talk about, I think assuming in 2024, 6.5% of a load rate for incentives, and I believe you said that was similar to the fourth quarter, if you could just remind us where you were in the fourth quarter versus the third and earlier in the year. And to the extent that perhaps incentives ticked down a little bit in the first quarter of 2024, should we be thinking that that would be a 3Q or a 4Q impact? Just trying to get the sense there of the lag.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll have Bob do the last piece. So, we're up 50 basis points from Q3. We were 6% in Q3, 6.5% in Q4. In terms of what that means for 2024, I think I addressed it on a prior call. We're going to actively be managing our incentive load, but we've shared with you what our assumption is in kind of current form. If there's an opportunity to peel those back, we'll do it and we'll certainly share that with you. In terms of kind of the quarters that it would impact, right now about 50% - somewhere around 50% of our sales are spec. so, those are closing in kind of the following quarter. Spec sales now would either be late Q1 closings or early Q2 closings. If it's a dirt sale, Q1 closings typically end up being Q3 or early Q4 closing. So, we factored all of those assumptions into the margin guide that we gave for the year, which is 28% to 28.5%, just to repeat that. And then Bob, I don't know if you have the incentive load for Q1, Q2. I think that was the only piece I didn't answer. \nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes. It was about 6% in each of the first, second, and third quarters, and it was 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. No, that's helpful. Thank you for that. I guess secondly, I'd love to kind of shift a little bit to the SG&A side. I think you gave guidance for the first quarter, but you've been running last couple of years plus or minus around 9%, low 9%. Obviously, we've heard a little bit about higher commission rates coming back maybe in a more choppy market at points in the past year or so. Overall solid market, but still we've heard a little bit about commissions maybe coming up a little bit. How should we think about SG&A and the potential for further leverage over the next couple of years against the growth algorithm that you talked about? And if commissions, let's say are stable from here, could we see an 8% at some point or getting closer to an 8% number? Would just love your thoughts on that.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, we've - I think we've always been thoughtful in how we spend SG&A dollars. We have historically made some extra investments in the quality of the homes that we build and deliver and the customer experience that we provide for our homeowners. And then we - and we invest incremental dollars in the culture of our workforce. So, we\u2019ve tried to maintain balance within the SG&A structure as well. We're not trying to run kind of the leanest and the lean - on the lean end, we're also not trying to overspend. I think we're trying to be very balanced. In terms of the leverage for 2024 specifically, we've kind of given the guide, which will put us kind of in the low nines. And that's really reflective of kind of what Bob guided too on the average sales price, which we're expecting to be flat. And against that, you've still got wage inflation for kind of our internal employees running close to 3.5%, 4%. So, there's some pressure. There's pressure on the SG&A front that we're not necessarily getting the benefit of on the ASP increase side. So, in terms of kind of where it goes into the future, time will tell, but we\u2019ve given the best visibility that we can for 2024. Bob, I don\u2019t know if you - anything you'd add on SG&A. Bob keeps us honest, I'll tell you that. We're not overspending anywhere, at least not under Bob's watch.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Reid with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSam Reid: Hey, thanks so much, guys, for taking my question here. Wanted to drill down a little bit on the first-time buyer. You guys have given a lot of good color on pricing. It does sound like price did move lower for this buyer group a bit again during the quarter. Maybe help us unpack the relative split perhaps between higher incentives for this buyer group as you try to make these homes more affordable versus perhaps some of the other affordability levers that you might be pulling, like smaller floor plans, et cetera. Kind of any color here would be appreciated.\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I would tell you, if you look year-over-year, pricing at 422 to that buyer is down 6%. Year-over-year is down about 1% versus the trailing quarter, so the third quarter of this year. And I would tell you it is largely incentive-related. And so, we're not - we haven't in the last three months or the last 12 months, had a radical redesign of the product that we're offering to people. Communities, when they get entitled, you have product approvals. So, to a degree, you can see people saying, I want the smaller floor plan. I would tell you, that's not the driver of the price change. It is the incentive load that we've introduced. So, it's that 220 basis points, which for that buyer is about, call it, $8,000. That's the price decline.\nSam Reid: No, that's helpful. And maybe one more on pricing here, just from a slightly different vantage point. You guys have given good color in the past on option and lot premiums and the impact on ASP. I want to say it's been around $100,000 or north of $100,000 across your entire mix throughout 2023. Curious as to where that trended in Q4, and maybe give us a sense as to your outlook for that piece of the price component into 2024.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, in the fourth quarter, it was $105,000 per unit, so it's down about $4,000 versus the prior year. And so, I think that speaks to the sales team, and I give them a lot of credit. Where we've needed incentive has been less around options and lot premiums and more oriented towards financing. So, we didn't see a big change there, which I think is a real positive. It also is - interestingly, for that move-up in active adult buying, we've highlighted the relative strength from them in this quarter and the relative pricing strength there. So, just like our first time was down about 6%, our move-up pricing was actually flat quarter-over-quarter, and our active adult was actually tough 3%. And I think it's reflective of the way we go to market, the way we sell the lots that we've got, the options that people put in houses. So, our teams are still doing a really good job of providing value for that which people desire.\nSam Reid: Helpful color all around. I'll pass it on, guys. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nKen Zener: Morning, everybody. I've got two very simple questions. First is on land banking. What percent of closings do you expect to be from finished lots once you reach your 70% option owned scenario generally?\nRyan Marshall: It's an interesting question. Certainly, the land banking would be finished lots. But for the optionality that we have with individual sellers, many of those were self-developing. And so, I don't - I don\u2019t know, Jim, if you \u2026\nJim Ossowski: Yes. My - and this is a, a little bit of a guess, Ken, roughly 20% to 25% of our total closings, once we get to 70/30, will be finished lots. The rest will - there'll be a lot of optionality in there. But to Bob's point, a lot of our options we take down as raw land chunks, and then we self-develop those. They\u2019re still highly efficient. It's just a different form of an option structure.\nKen Zener: Right. I assume that's kind of reflecting your entry level exposure as well. Second question is, talk to options. Again, could you update us what percent of your ASP is coming from options? And then comment on the margin benefit you get from that, if you could, so we could discern your operating construction, operating construction costs versus your strategy of bringing in these options. Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Sorry, I want to make sure I understand the \u2026\nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: The $4,000, the $105,000 you just gave. \nRyan Marshall: How much of it is options? \nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: No, I think \u2026\nKen Zener: Right. Your total ASP, you have a certain option exposure more at move-up and adult - active adult, but could you talk to the margin impact of that as well? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So, of the $105,000 of option and lot premium, $80,000 is options, $25,000, that's lots premium. I could say for instance, lot premiums are pure margin. I'm not sure that that's fair, right? Pricing doesn't really work that way. But in terms of the option spend, typically it's going to have a relatively rich margin mix, call it, 50%. And so, it is accretive to the overall margin. And the way we try and go to market, Ken, and I don\u2019t know if this answers it better, we put a base price house that we think is kind of market standard and what people can and should expect to pay for that house. Then we start talking about, okay, which lot do you want? What are you willing to pay for that lot? That's what generates the $25,000. And then, okay, now in the house, if we're offering optionality - and we don't for everyone, right? So, for the Centex buyer, we may have curated packages or no choices at all. But for the folks that can do structural options for fit and finish, that's what's driving that $80,000 in incremental revenue.\nKen Zener: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. A question on cycle times. So, congrats on the improvement there. Sounds like you expect to see further improvement in 2024. Curious to get to the 100-day target from 130 where you're at right now, you guys are targeting 5% growth. We've heard some other builders may be a little bit higher than that. Is there a level from a labor perspective where if builders try to push starts more significantly, that you think cycle time improvement might stall a bit? Are there any constraints that you could foresee, or is the unleashing of kind of the normalization of the supply chain just kind of independent of whatever the start pace might look like in 2024?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. Based on the total amount of production that's happening, I don't see the industry stressing the labor availability. I'm not suggesting there's a whole bunch of excess labor running around out there, but at least for the big builders, I think we've got great trade relationships, and I think we'll continue to get, not only schedule performance, but the labor on our job sites. I think the pressure likely comes on dollars before - or more so than time. If we're running into labor pinches because of a volume increase, I think it's probably dollars more than time. A lot of the decreases that we'll take, it'll be because we're getting things on a predictable schedule like we used to pre-COVID. So, that's working better, which allows us to take some kind of dead days out of our schedule that we had - we built in for things to go wrong or for time when we were just literally waiting for material to show up. So, it\u2019s a little bit of that, a little bit of, we're just getting back to the cycle times that we had pre-COVID. So, we trimmed out about 30 or so days in 2024, or in 2023, rather. We think we can get another 30 or so days by the end of 2024, and we'll be back largely in line with pre-COVID cycle times.\nAlan Ratner: Great. Appreciate those added thoughts, Ryan. And then I guess in a similar vein, was curious if you could just give an update on the ICG growth plans there and kind of how that's been trending and what your current thinking is as far as additional market expansion, if there is any.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, it continues to go well. We have two plants today. Both are focused in the southeast part of the US. Our growth plans are still largely on target. Still largely on target to have approximately eight factories. So, we haven't announced anything new. Similar to our share buybacks, we'll probably report the news on that as opposed to give forward-looking forecast.\nAlan Ratner: And I guess if I could sneak one in on that, I mean it's hard for us to conceptualize what impact that has on your business, and obviously it's concentrated in a handful of markets right now, but are there certain kind of metrics that you can share with us, whether it's cycle times or costs, margin, et cetera, that you can kind of demonstrate on a case study basis, how that's contributing to your business right now?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, so that's - we haven't given a bunch of guidance on that just because it is concentrated into a couple of markets, and we don't feel it's appropriate to extrapolate the entire enterprise yet. As we get further down the path, we'll share more. Conceptually, it's exactly what you highlighted. We're getting cycle time improvements. We're getting better quality, and there are some raw material cost savings that we believe we're getting as well.\nAlan Ratner: I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for fitting me in. My first question is just around the specs. You mentioned that you had about 44%, I think of your production that's in spec. As you think about the year and the way that the demand may come together, any thoughts on where that may move, or how you're thinking about it longer term?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Susan, I wouldn't anticipate a massive change from the percentage. We're probably on the higher end of the range that we'll have in spec right now. Specific to the fourth quarter, we put more spec starts in the ground than what we sold, and that was intentional. We wanted to have some additional inventory going into the spring selling season, which we have. So, as we move throughout the year, probably right in line with where we're at or a tad lower.\nSusan Maklari: Okay, that's helpful. And then when we think generally about the potential for rates to come down this year, and that possibly driving some increase on the existing home side of the market, any thoughts on what the implications of that could be, especially perhaps on the move-up and the active adult parts of the businesses, and any initiatives you have relative to that?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Susan, with the rate cuts that are forecasted, I don't see it being at a level that's going to unleash a tidal wave of resale inventory. So, is it better than where we're at today? Certainly. Will that start to free up some resale inventory? I think so. And I think that's probably helpful against the backdrop of, we continue to be under-supplied in the country. So, on balance, I don't think it has much impact at all on what we're projecting for our business in 2024.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thanks for the color and good luck.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America, where we've reached the time allotment for this morning's call. Please go ahead.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking my questions. Can you - in terms of the additional 30 days of build cycle improvement you're expecting for 2024, can you talk about what the build cycles are in homes that you're starting today? Like, are you already at that 100-day level, and is that improvement embedded in your cashflow guide?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Rafe, it's a fair question. The homes that we're starting today will deliver in kind of late - so homes we\u2019re starting today will deliver in Q2 basically. So, no, we're not at the 100 days yet. Now, that being said, there are some markets and some communities where we\u2019re at the 100 days, and in fact, we were at the 100 days last year. When you blend it all together, we think it'll be Q4 before we're at the 100 days that we've highlighted as our goal. \nBob O\u2019Shaughnessy: And Rafe, our guide does factor in what we see in terms of cycle times during the year, the cash flow guide, to your question.\nRafe Jadrosich: Got. Thank you. That's helpful. And then you gave really helpful color in terms of the land inflation you're expecting in your gross margin for 2024, and you have the land you have the land that you need through 2025. On the land that you are contracting today, what are you seeing in terms of inflation? Is it at a similar level or are you actually seeing that come down? And then can you kind of help us understand the difference between development cost inflation relative to what you're seeing for raw land?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, so - sorry, I forgot the first part of the question. \nRafe Jadrosich: You spoke about the land inflation in the \u2026\nRyan Marshall: Oh, I think I got it. I'm sorry. Yes, we - listen, it's interesting. Land prices don't come down very often. They're sticky. And we've seen, and we've highlighted sort of sequential increases in lot costs. I would tell you that the land we're seeing today is consistent with that. Prices are pretty robust and it's a pretty competitive landscape out there. We underwrite to return. And so, it's - we look to see, can we get return out of that. So, I think no change honestly in the land market. In terms of the inflationary aspect, what we are seeing is that that labor constraint influences the development of land, just like it does building of houses. And with general cost inflation that we were seeing last year in particular, it was influencing the spends of type. Everything that we do to do the development of the communities was running pretty hot too. So, again, we've highlighted, we think it's going to be a little bit more expensive in terms of our lot increase this year for 2024. And again, I think that just reflects all the activity that was going on and some of the cost inflation that we saw in 2023 feeding into our lots this year in 2024. The good news is, the vertical, we're seeing a pretty benign in that market, whereas that had been running pretty hot last year obviously. So, the slowdown in inflation, we feel it now in the house. Hopefully, we'll feel that a little bit later and land. It would be an opportunity for us, for sure.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you. Appreciate all the color.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.\nJim Zeumer: Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We'll certainly be available over the rest of the day if you have any additional questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'm excited to speak with you today about PulteGroup's outstanding fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Over the past few years, we have faced macro challenges ranging from COVID, to supply chain disruptions, to skyrocketing mortgage rates. Through it all, we've remained disciplined and consistent in running our operations, but when needed, have quickly adjusted key business practices to position PulteGroup for ongoing success. The benefits of this approach can be seen in the strength of our reported results. Bob will detail our Q4 performance, so let me highlight several of our key operating and financial achievements for the full year of 2023. By strategically increasing our spec production, we had more inventory available to meet the demand of first time home buyers and those consumers worried about mortgage rate volatility. Increased house inventory was a critical support to PulteGroup delivering 28,600 homes in 2023, and record home sale revenues of $15.6 billion. In the face of increased costs for land, labor, and materials, we carefully managed product offerings, pricing, incentives, and absorption paces to maintain high profitability, while ensuring we continue to turn our assets. The result, we reported outstanding full-year gross margins of 29.3%, which helped drive a 6% increase in earnings per share to a record $11.72 per share, and a 27% return on equity. We also continue to efficiently increase our land pipeline as we completed transactions to put approximately 40,000 new lots under control. Inclusive of these lots, 53% of our total land pipeline is under option, either with the land sellers or through our expanding land banking structures. Since making the decision to expand our use of land banking starting 15 months ago, we have placed approximately 25 communities representing $1.5 billion worth of future land and development spend into such structures. And finally, consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $4.3 billion into the business through land acquisition and development spend in 2023, and returned $1.2 billion to investors through share repurchases, dividends, and debt paydown. Inclusive of our 2023 spend, we have repurchased almost half of the 2013 shares outstanding since initiating the program over a decade ago.  By remaining consistent in our business practices and making market-responsive adjustments were needed, we reported another year of exceptional financial results. I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their tireless efforts and support in delivering superior homes and experiences to our home buyers, while providing outstanding financial returns to our investors. Consistent with the broader housing market, we saw homebuying demand being negatively impacted during the early part of the fourth quarter, as 30-year mortgage rates increase toward their 2023 peak of 8%. We then saw buyer sentiment and demand improved, as mortgage rates finally rolled over, ultimately dropping more than 100 basis points as we moved through November and December. The decline in rates helped drive our December net new orders and absorption pace to be the highest month in the quarter. The increased homebuying activity in December was an important driver of the 57% increase in our Q4 net new orders, and demonstrates the desire for home ownership remains high across all buyer groups. It remains our view that the long-term outlook for new home construction is extremely positive. A structural shortage of housing caused by years of underbuilding has only been exacerbated by a lack of resale inventory as owners are financially and/or emotionally locked into their low rate mortgages. While the lack of existing home inventory will resolve itself over time, we believe that land entitlement and labor availability challenges mean it will be difficult to correct for the many years of underbuilding in this country. Given our constructive views on the outlook for housing demand, we are investing in our operations, with the goal of growing unit volumes by 5% to 10% annually. Our decision to walk away from option locks as interest rates increased in 2022, will impact our community openings in 2024, leading to our growth this year being closer to the lower end of this range, as we expect closings of approximately 30,000 homes in 2024.  For those of you who have followed PulteGroup's story for the past few years, you know it's never been about growth for growth's sake. Our focus is always on investing in our business to build shareholder value. So, our objective is to grow our volumes while maintaining high returns on equity. To accomplish this, we must continue to intelligently invest in high quality and high returning projects, while continuing to invest in our own assets through the ongoing repurchase of our stock. As we have demonstrated for much of the past decade, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows that will allow us to fund our business investment, pay our dividend, and return excess capital to our shareholders, all while maintaining our balance sheet strength and flexibility. Our expectation of continued financial success is reflected in this morning's announcement that our board approved a $1.5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. With many forecasting interest rates to fall, the economy to stay relatively healthy, and conditions in the job market to remain favorable, there are certainly reasons to be optimistic about housing demand in the coming years.  Let me now turn over the call to Bob for a review of our fourth quarter results. Bob? Thanks, Bob. Successfully navigating our business through the past 12 months of rising interest rates has been challenging. The same could be said about the past 24, 36, and 48-month periods as we battled through COVID and the global collapse in supply chains. I am extremely proud of how our entire team responded to these events and the exceptional operating and financial results PulteGroup has delivered over an unprecedented period. Looking back over the five-year period of 2019 to the just recently completed 2023, we grew volumes 5% annually and delivered just under 135,000 homes. To support our growth during this period and for future years, we invested almost $19 billion in cumulative land acquisition and development spend. Through our disciplined land investment, operational focus, and organizational expertise, we capitalized on market conditions to grow earnings per share over this period at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, while delivering an average annual return on equity of just over 26%. It's this type of strong financial performance during an extended period of market volatility that has prompted increased discussion about the need to reconsider how the large homebuilders are valued. I think that if you want to be valued differently, you must demonstrate a fundamental change in how you operate the business and the results you deliver, not just for a year or two, but over an extended period of time. What's different about the past five years is that while investing $19 billion into our operation, we also generated almost $7 billion in net cash flow from operations during the sustained period of growth. In fact, we recorded only one year of negative cash flow from operations since shifting our focus in 2012 from just topline growth, to driving high returns over the housing cycle. We paid off $1.1 billion of debt, while cutting our leverage by more than half, to end 2023 with a debt to capital ratio of 15.9%, and a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%. And we returned $4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. I'd add that the reality is, we've been operating our business in just this way for really the past 10 years. I know stocks reflect performance, so I believe that if we can continue to both grow our business and deliver ROE that remains among the industry leaders, while generating positive cash flow and maintaining a low risk profile, that our stock price and shareholders will ultimately be rewarded.  Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Carl, so Bob highlighted in the prepared remarks that we - specifically in Q4, October, November, were really below expectations, and it was driven by high rates. We had a great December, highest month in the quarter in terms of absolute sales and absorptions per community. So, that was certainly an anomaly for typical December seasonal patterns. And the strength has really continued into January, Carl. So, we're feeling pretty good about how the year is starting. In terms of kind of where it sets us up for reduced discounts, increased prices, we're going to watch it closely, and I think we've demonstrated through past behavior that we're always looking to find the sweet spot between pace and price. It won't come as a surprise to you, Carl, that affordability with the buyers remains a challenge. And so, I think we're going to have to be thoughtful about what we do on both the incentive and the price increase front, but we're feeling pretty good about how the year started. Yes. Carl, our move-up business performed incredibly well in the quarter. We had, on a year-over-year basis, the growth was north of 70%. So, I think that segment performed very well. The margins out of our move-up, as well as our Del Webb business continue to be some of our best gross margins. So, we're seeing real financial strength there also. And then in terms of kind of community mix, Carl, we're kind of right in line with where our long-term strategic targets are in terms of kind of that part of our business being about 35% of our overall mix. So, we feel pretty good about where that business is positioned. Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. We feel really good about how we position the land pipeline. We've been investing for growth for a number of years, and we've been trying to do it in a very responsible way specific to having less owned and more optioned land. The fact that over the last 15 months we've made significant headway with our land banking platform, has helped with that. So, we really like the number of lots that we have under control at 225,000 plus or minus. And we like the ownership structure, or the way that we or the way that we've controlled those lands. We think it's a really capital-efficient structure. Specific to your growth target number, yes, we're going to be at the lower end for 2024. Beyond that, we feel that we've got the right structure to kind of be in that range for future periods. Yes, John, we didn't give a specific increase out of December. We kept more of our commentary around the qualitative side of things, which I'd reiterate, we're very pleased with how things are performing in January, and we'd expect that strength to continue. So, we continue to be in a situation where there's low supply. Affordability has definitely gotten better. You heard Bob's comment about kind of what we've assumed with our incentive load. So, yes, I'd expect us to have a strong Q1. The one thing - other thing I'd offer that's probably of note is we're starting to see some real signs of life in our western markets. Those have been - that's been a part of the country that was slow for the majority of kind of 2022 and most all of 2023. But in the last 30 to 45 days, we're really starting to see those markets pick up, which is a welcomed outcome. Honestly, I'm going to defer. We typically do - we report the news on that. I think you highlight, we've done about $1 billion a year the last couple of years. We have $.8 billion in cash. We have offered that we project about $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations in the current year. So, our capital allocation priorities don't change. We've said we're going to increase our land investment to $5 billion. That's up about 16% year-over-year. We increased our dividend 25%. That's not a huge cash element, but still, I think reflective of our confidence in the business. We do have $.8 billion of authorization. And like I said, we'll report the news. You saw this year we bought back $100 million of our notes because it was attractive. The rate environment has made that a little less attractive, but we always look at liability management as part of the equation. So, really no change to our capital allocation priorities. Yes, Stephen, so a couple things there. We are increasing our land spend in 2024 from $4.3 billion to $5 billion. Our mix of developed spend versus land acquisition spend will continue to probably be about 60% development, 40% land acq. And then our long-term desire is to have 70% of our land control via option. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, this year we moved that from 48% option to 53% controlled via option. So, we're - I think both in - we demonstrated through results over the past number of years as well as kind of articulated long-term goals, we want to be land lighter. We're going to continue to do it the right way, all with an eye toward delivering a lower risk model that's very capital-efficient as well. Yes. Stephen, in terms of years owned, we'd expect to probably keep that right around the level that we're at, maybe a slight decrease. And then ultimately, we would start to flip from a years owned to years option. You'll see a little bit of a trade in that mix. Yes, I don't know that there's kind of a hard and fast answer to that, Stephen. It depends on the mix of the business that we've got. In terms of margin, it can be a couple of hundred basis points on a relative basis. And in terms of inventory turns, certainly it's going to be more efficient than a bulk raw transaction. But it depends on the life of the asset. So, it in Del Webb, it's going to be very different than it is in the Centex business for us. So, I wouldn't want to paint that with too broad a brush. Yes, Joe, we've - I think the reason we've assumed that the incentive load stays about where it is just because affordability continues to be challenged. So, we've got low supply but interest rates are relatively higher. And because of low supply, I think there's still some pressure on prices being elevated historically. So, we talked a lot in 2023 about how successful we were in helping to solve some of the affordability challenges with the incentive dollars that we put toward the forward mortgage commitments. We'll continue to use that as a tool in 2024. Now, as rates fall, we think the cost of those forwards mortgage rate commitments will become less. We've made an assumption that we reallocate some of those incentive dollars to other things that help to solve the affordability challenge and get a buyer into their home. So, is it conservative? Time will tell. I think what you've seen from us historically is, we're not afraid to raise price. We're not afraid to cut discounts, and we're always looking to optimize pace and price. You've also heard me talk the last several quarters, we're not going to be margin proud. So, we're doing things to be responsive to what the market is, to derive an outcome that yields the best return for our shareholders. And you'll see us actively managing all things, pace, price, incentives, forward, more forward mortgage commitments, et cetera. Yes, Mike, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll have Bob do the last piece. So, we're up 50 basis points from Q3. We were 6% in Q3, 6.5% in Q4. In terms of what that means for 2024, I think I addressed it on a prior call. We're going to actively be managing our incentive load, but we've shared with you what our assumption is in kind of current form. If there's an opportunity to peel those back, we'll do it and we'll certainly share that with you. In terms of kind of the quarters that it would impact, right now about 50% - somewhere around 50% of our sales are spec. so, those are closing in kind of the following quarter. Spec sales now would either be late Q1 closings or early Q2 closings. If it's a dirt sale, Q1 closings typically end up being Q3 or early Q4 closing. So, we factored all of those assumptions into the margin guide that we gave for the year, which is 28% to 28.5%, just to repeat that. And then Bob, I don't know if you have the incentive load for Q1, Q2. I think that was the only piece I didn't answer. Yes, Mike, we've - I think we've always been thoughtful in how we spend SG&A dollars. We have historically made some extra investments in the quality of the homes that we build and deliver and the customer experience that we provide for our homeowners. And then we - and we invest incremental dollars in the culture of our workforce. So, we've tried to maintain balance within the SG&A structure as well. We're not trying to run kind of the leanest and the lean - on the lean end, we're also not trying to overspend. I think we're trying to be very balanced. In terms of the leverage for 2024 specifically, we've kind of given the guide, which will put us kind of in the low nines. And that's really reflective of kind of what Bob guided too on the average sales price, which we're expecting to be flat. And against that, you've still got wage inflation for kind of our internal employees running close to 3.5%, 4%. So, there's some pressure. There's pressure on the SG&A front that we're not necessarily getting the benefit of on the ASP increase side. So, in terms of kind of where it goes into the future, time will tell, but we've given the best visibility that we can for 2024. Bob, I don't know if you - anything you'd add on SG&A. Bob keeps us honest, I'll tell you that. We're not overspending anywhere, at least not under Bob's watch. Yes, in the fourth quarter, it was $105,000 per unit, so it's down about $4,000 versus the prior year. And so, I think that speaks to the sales team, and I give them a lot of credit. Where we've needed incentive has been less around options and lot premiums and more oriented towards financing. So, we didn't see a big change there, which I think is a real positive. It also is - interestingly, for that move-up in active adult buying, we've highlighted the relative strength from them in this quarter and the relative pricing strength there. So, just like our first time was down about 6%, our move-up pricing was actually flat quarter-over-quarter, and our active adult was actually tough 3%. And I think it's reflective of the way we go to market, the way we sell the lots that we've got, the options that people put in houses. So, our teams are still doing a really good job of providing value for that which people desire. It's an interesting question. Certainly, the land banking would be finished lots. But for the optionality that we have with individual sellers, many of those were self-developing. And so, I don't - I don't know, Jim, if you ... Sorry, I want to make sure I understand the ... How much of it is options? Yes. So, of the $105,000 of option and lot premium, $80,000 is options, $25,000, that's lots premium. I could say for instance, lot premiums are pure margin. I'm not sure that that's fair, right? Pricing doesn't really work that way. But in terms of the option spend, typically it's going to have a relatively rich margin mix, call it, 50%. And so, it is accretive to the overall margin. And the way we try and go to market, Ken, and I don't know if this answers it better, we put a base price house that we think is kind of market standard and what people can and should expect to pay for that house. Then we start talking about, okay, which lot do you want? What are you willing to pay for that lot? That's what generates the $25,000. And then, okay, now in the house, if we're offering optionality - and we don't for everyone, right? So, for the Centex buyer, we may have curated packages or no choices at all. But for the folks that can do structural options for fit and finish, that's what's driving that $80,000 in incremental revenue. Yes, it's a fair question. Based on the total amount of production that's happening, I don't see the industry stressing the labor availability. I'm not suggesting there's a whole bunch of excess labor running around out there, but at least for the big builders, I think we've got great trade relationships, and I think we'll continue to get, not only schedule performance, but the labor on our job sites. I think the pressure likely comes on dollars before - or more so than time. If we're running into labor pinches because of a volume increase, I think it's probably dollars more than time. A lot of the decreases that we'll take, it'll be because we're getting things on a predictable schedule like we used to pre-COVID. So, that's working better, which allows us to take some kind of dead days out of our schedule that we had - we built in for things to go wrong or for time when we were just literally waiting for material to show up. So, it's a little bit of that, a little bit of, we're just getting back to the cycle times that we had pre-COVID. So, we trimmed out about 30 or so days in 2024, or in 2023, rather. We think we can get another 30 or so days by the end of 2024, and we'll be back largely in line with pre-COVID cycle times. Yes, Alan, it continues to go well. We have two plants today. Both are focused in the southeast part of the US. Our growth plans are still largely on target. Still largely on target to have approximately eight factories. So, we haven't announced anything new. Similar to our share buybacks, we'll probably report the news on that as opposed to give forward-looking forecast. Yes, Alan, so that's - we haven't given a bunch of guidance on that just because it is concentrated into a couple of markets, and we don't feel it's appropriate to extrapolate the entire enterprise yet. As we get further down the path, we'll share more. Conceptually, it's exactly what you highlighted. We're getting cycle time improvements. We're getting better quality, and there are some raw material cost savings that we believe we're getting as well. Yes, Susan, I wouldn't anticipate a massive change from the percentage. We're probably on the higher end of the range that we'll have in spec right now. Specific to the fourth quarter, we put more spec starts in the ground than what we sold, and that was intentional. We wanted to have some additional inventory going into the spring selling season, which we have. So, as we move throughout the year, probably right in line with where we're at or a tad lower. Yes, Susan, with the rate cuts that are forecasted, I don't see it being at a level that's going to unleash a tidal wave of resale inventory. So, is it better than where we're at today? Certainly. Will that start to free up some resale inventory? I think so. And I think that's probably helpful against the backdrop of, we continue to be under-supplied in the country. So, on balance, I don't think it has much impact at all on what we're projecting for our business in 2024. Yes, Rafe, it's a fair question. The homes that we're starting today will deliver in kind of late - so homes we're starting today will deliver in Q2 basically. So, no, we're not at the 100 days yet. Now, that being said, there are some markets and some communities where we're at the 100 days, and in fact, we were at the 100 days last year. When you blend it all together, we think it'll be Q4 before we're at the 100 days that we've highlighted as our goal. Yes, so - sorry, I forgot the first part of the question. Oh, I think I got it. I'm sorry. Yes, we - listen, it's interesting. Land prices don't come down very often. They're sticky. And we've seen, and we've highlighted sort of sequential increases in lot costs. I would tell you that the land we're seeing today is consistent with that. Prices are pretty robust and it's a pretty competitive landscape out there. We underwrite to return. And so, it's - we look to see, can we get return out of that. So, I think no change honestly in the land market. In terms of the inflationary aspect, what we are seeing is that that labor constraint influences the development of land, just like it does building of houses. And with general cost inflation that we were seeing last year in particular, it was influencing the spends of type. Everything that we do to do the development of the communities was running pretty hot too. So, again, we've highlighted, we think it's going to be a little bit more expensive in terms of our lot increase this year for 2024. And again, I think that just reflects all the activity that was going on and some of the cost inflation that we saw in 2023 feeding into our lots this year in 2024. The good news is, the vertical, we're seeing a pretty benign in that market, whereas that had been running pretty hot last year obviously. So, the slowdown in inflation, we feel it now in the house. Hopefully, we'll feel that a little bit later and land. It would be an opportunity for us, for sure."

            "name": "Bob O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. Good morning. As Ryan mentioned in his comments, market conditions changed meaningfully as the fourth quarter progressed and as mortgage rates began to fall. Our reported financial results for the period were influenced by these evolving market dynamics, so I'll note any important areas of impact in my prepared remarks. Wholesale revenues in the fourth quarter were $4.2 billion, compared with $5 billion in the prior year. Our lower home sale revenues for the period primarily reflect a 14% decrease in closings to 7,615 homes, along with a 2% decrease in our average sales price to $547,000. I would highlight that our fourth quarter closings came in about 5% below our previous guide, as sales early in the quarter were negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates and the general softening in overall buyer demand. As Ryan noted, homebuying demand accelerated in the back half of the quarter, but sales, particularly sales of finished spec homes that would close in the quarter, finished below our assumptions. We could have captured incremental sales and closing value by offering higher incentives, but we didn't see that as a worthwhile tradeoff. Given that buyer trends have remained positive in January, I think we made the right choices as we have inventory available to meet the stronger demand.  Our mix of closings in the quarter were comprised 40% first time, 36% move-up, and 24% active adult, which is in alignment with our stated goal for the buyer mix for our business. In the fourth quarter of 2022, closings were 36% first time, 39% move-up, and 25% active adult. Our average community count for the fourth quarter was 919, which represents an 8% increase over last year's fourth quarter average of 850 communities, and was in line with our prior guidance. Looking at order activity in the quarter, our net new orders increased 57% over last year to 6,214 homes. The large increase over last year reflects both improved demand in 2023, as well as the extremely difficult operating environment in the fourth quarter of 2022. As discussed previously, demand conditions grew increasingly difficult early in the fourth quarter this year as mortgage rates climbed to 8%, but we experienced a notable improvement in buying activity as rates decreased over the back half of the quarter. On a sequential basis, our absorption pace improved from November to December, and we would attribute much of this improvement to the decline in interest rates. Along with stronger demand conditions, the year-over-year increase in fourth quarter net new orders benefited from a decrease in cancellation rates. In the most recent quarter, cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog fell to 9%, down from 11% in the comparable prior year period. Looking at our order activity by buyer group, fourth quarter net new orders increased 70% for first time buyers, 78% for move-up buyers, and 15% for active adult buyers. Our order numbers indicate that demand improved across all buyer groups, which is a very positive dynamic when assessing potential housing demand in 2024. As a result of our sales and closing activity, our quarter end backlog was 12,146 homes, which is effectively flat with last year. Reflective of the increased mix of first-time buyers and their lower average sales prices, our ending backlog value declined slightly to $7.3 billion. Inclusive of the 7,128 homes we started in the fourth quarter, we ended the year with 16,889 homes in production. 44% of our production is spec, including 1,263 finished specs, which puts us in a strong position to meet buyer demand as we head into the spring selling season. By the end of the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time was down to 130 days, which is a sequential improvement of about two weeks from the end of the third quarter. Going forward, we continue to target getting our cycle time down to 100 days or below by the end of the year. Based on our production pipeline, we expect closings in the first quarter of 2024 to be between 6,200 and 6,600 homes. And given our units under production, we expect full-year deliveries to grow by 5% to 30,000 homes. We currently expect the average sales price of closings to remain in the range of $540 million to $550,000 for the first quarter and the full year of 2024, which is consistent with our fourth quarter pricing. At the midpoint, this would imply price stability over the course of the year. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 28.9%, which is down approximately 50 basis points from both the fourth quarter of last year and the third quarter of this year, but likely remains the industry leader among the big builders. As with the entire year, our fourth quarter margins reflect higher incentive and input costs. Incentives, which primarily impact revenues, increased 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter to 6.5%. On the cost side, lower lumber prices offset inflation and other material and labor, but higher land and land development costs impacted margins in the period. Given my prior comments that we expect pricing to be flat in 2024, we anticipate that land and house cost inflation will result in gross margins to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% for each quarter during the year.  We reported fourth quarter SG&A expense of $308 billion, or 7.4% of home sale revenues, compared with prior year SG&A expense of $351 million, or 7.1%. The 30-basis point drop in overhead leverage can be attributed to the lower closings and revenues realized in the quarter versus the prior year. It should be noted that we recorded $65 billion of pre-tax insurance benefit in the fourth quarters of both 2023 and 2022. Based on anticipated closing volumes, we expect SG&A expense for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Given our typical seasonality of closings, we expect SG&A expense in the first quarter to be approximately 10% of home sale revenues, with overhead leverage improving as we move through the remaining quarters of the year.  For the fourth quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $44 million, which is up from $24 million last year. The improvement in pre-tax income reflects more favorable market conditions across our financial services platform, coupled with higher capture rates, including an increase to 85%, up from 75% last year in our mortgage operations. Our reported pre-tax income for the most recent quarter was $947, million compared with prior year pre-tax income of $1.2 billion. In the period, we recorded tax expense of $236 million for an effective tax rate of 24.9%. Projecting ahead to 2024, we expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Looking at the bottom line, our reported fourth quarter results showed net income of $711 million or $3.28 per share. In the comparable prior year period, we reported net income of $882 million, or $3.85 per share. For the full year of 2023, we reported net income of $2.6 billion and a record earnings of $11.72 per share. Reflective of our strong operating results, in 2023 we generated cash flows from operations of $2.2 billion. Given our current expectations for operating and financial results, along with our plans to increase land investment to $5 billion in the coming year, we expect 2024 cash flows from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion.  Turning to our investment and capital allocation activities, we invested $1.3 billion in land acquisition and development in the fourth quarter, of which 59% was for development of our existing land assets. For the year, our land investment totaled $4.3 billion, of which 59% was for development. Given our constructive views on near and longer term housing dynamics, as noted, our plan is to increase our land spend to approximately $5 billion in 2024. We would again anticipate a roughly 60/40 split between development and land acquisition. This increase in investment is consistent with Ryan's earlier comments regarding positioning the business to routinely grow future delivery volumes by 5% to 10% per year. Inclusive of our fourth quarter investments, we ended 2023 with 223,000 lots under control, which is an increase of 5% over the prior year. I would highlight that on a year-over-year basis, we lowered our owned lot count by 4,000 lots, while increasing our lots under option by roughly 16,000 lots. As a result, our percentage of lots under option increased to 53%, up from 48% last year. There's still a lot of runway ahead of us to achieve our goal of 70% option lots, but we're moving in the right direction.  Based on the investments we've made and our anticipated community openings and closings in 2024, we expect our average community count in 2024 to be up 3% to 5% in each quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we continue to return capital to shareholders in 2023. To that end, we paid out $142 million in dividends, and have increased our dividend per share by 25%, starting in the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 13.8 billion common shares at a cost of $1 billion for an average price of $72.50 per share, which included $300 million of repurchases at an average price of $83.03 per share in the fourth quarter. With the 13.8 billion shares acquired in 2023, we have repurchased approximately half of the shares outstanding at the time we initiated the program back in 2013. Having repurchased these shares at an average cost of $32.16 per share, we believe it's been a great investment for our shareholders. In addition to buying our stock, in the fourth quarter we took advantage of market conditions by using $35 billion of cash on hand to pay down a portion of our debt. For all of 2023, we retired $101 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions, helping to lower our quarter end debt to capital ratio to 15.9%, down 280 basis points from last year. Adjusting for the $1.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, we ended the year with a net debt to capital ratio of 1.1%.  Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Yes, just maybe another point of clarification that not only were the sales strong, it was our strongest absorptions on a same-store basis. So, that consumer actually has performed well, to Ryan's point, strong margins and absorptions. Yes, maybe I'd add to that, the land for 2025 is under contract and probably in development right now. And so, we have line of sight to 2024, 2025, even up to 2026. We're still working through some of that, but we've - you can see from the approvals that we've did in this most recent quarter or for the year, 40,000 lots, no issues from our perspective in terms of lining up that type of growth rate. Yes, fair question, and I think we laid it out this way. To try and answer that question, I'll give you a little more color. We see pricing flat during the year. Now, you might see different pricing at different consumer groups. The first time is the most affordability challenge, and that's where we saw actually the biggest decline in the current quarter. But we think pricing is relatively flat through 2024. We see modest, call it, 2% to 4% house construction cost increases kind of mid to upper single-digit land increases, which is what we've experienced this year. And so, when you kind of mix that all together - the one other point I guess I'd offer to clarify is, we're assuming incentive loads stay about the same at the 6.5% that we saw in this quarter. So, when you marry that all up together, a little bit of a decline year-over-year, but still 28% to 28.5%, pretty strong margin performance. Yes, that's an interesting question. I'm not sure we can think like a manufacturing company completely. The risk profiles are different. But having said that, I think there are - based on the strength of the operation, based on the cash flow that we've consistently shown despite growth, which historically is not the way this industry has behaved, we believe there is an opportunity for people to think a little bit differently about the equity. In terms of how we manage the leverage on the balance sheet, a lot of that will have to do with our opportunities to invest in the business and what we do on the share repurchases. But even you look at the rating agencies, they've been slow, but they've been responsive to kind of I think seeing the value in the business model and also the way the debt gets looked at. So, would we use more debt for something? Without question, if it were for the right thing. Yes. It was about 6% in each of the first, second, and third quarters, and it was 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Yes, I would tell you, if you look year-over-year, pricing at 422 to that buyer is down 6%. Year-over-year is down about 1% versus the trailing quarter, so the third quarter of this year. And I would tell you it is largely incentive-related. And so, we're not - we haven't in the last three months or the last 12 months, had a radical redesign of the product that we're offering to people. Communities, when they get entitled, you have product approvals. So, to a degree, you can see people saying, I want the smaller floor plan. I would tell you, that's not the driver of the price change. It is the incentive load that we've introduced. So, it's that 220 basis points, which for that buyer is about, call it, $8,000. That's the price decline. The $4,000, the $105,000 you just gave. No, I think ... And Rafe, our guide does factor in what we see in terms of cycle times during the year, the cash flow guide, to your question."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Incorporated third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star, one a second time. Thank you, and I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Zeumer, you may begin.\nJames Zeumer: Great, thank you Abbie. We appreciate everyone joining today\u2019s call to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s third quarter operating and financial results.  As detailed in this morning\u2019s earnings release, PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong earnings as we continue to capitalize on our competitive strengths and balanced approach to the business. Joining me on today\u2019s call to discuss our Q3 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides has been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll post an audio replay of this call later today.  We want to inform everyone that today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Jim and good morning. As we will discuss over the next several minutes, PulteGroup reported another quarter of outstanding and, for a number of key metrics, record financial results.  Our financial performance demonstrates once again the importance of PulteGroup\u2019s balanced and differentiated operating model. Leveraging our broad geographic footprint and diversified product offering, we are working to maintain significant market share among all major buyer groups.  At the same time, we are successfully executing both large scale spec and build-to-order homebuilding businesses. Our spec business allows us to more cost efficiently serve first-time buyers, while our build-to-order business caters to move-up and active adult buyers looking to personalize their home location and design features.  Specific to our financial results, I am extremely proud of our entire organization for their efforts in delivering third quarter results that include a 43% increase in orders, industry-leading gross margins of 29.5%, record third quarter earnings of $2.90 per share, and a return on equity that exceeded 30%.  In the quarter, I would highlight our active adult business as an important contributor to our sign-up growth and our gross margin performance. In an operating environment where rising mortgage rates are creating increasing affordability challenges, 47% of our Del Webb purchasers were cash buyers. This is up from 33% just two years ago. Along with largely being cash buyers, these were customers who can afford the premium lots and upgrades that make active adult our highest margin business. Just to demonstrate the brand power of the Del Webb name, in June we opened Del Webb Kensington Ridge in Michigan, not a market you might consider a hotspot for retirees. In a community where base home prices range from $370,000 to north of $600,000, we have already sold 114 houses in just over 100 days.  We fully appreciate that to some degree, all buyers are impacted by rising rates and macroeconomic concerns, but buyer groups can absolutely behave differently over the course of a housing cycle. For PulteGroup, we believe being diversified across all buyer groups can enhance both growth and stability.  Beyond our diversification across buyer groups, PulteGroup\u2019s strong third quarter financial performance also benefited from our ability to offer consumers both spec built and build-to-order homes. As we have discussed on prior calls over the past 24 months, we have transitioned our first-time buyer communities to a spec build model to better serve these customers. Looking at our first time business, spec building allows us to maintain a more consistent cadence of starts in those communities, which drives construction efficiencies and is important in working with our trades. More directly to our quarter, having additional inventory available was important given 49% of our sales in the period were spec sales. I would note that 49% spec sales in the quarter is down from 58% in Q1 of this year. I think the decrease in the relative percentage of spec sales in the quarter reflects two interesting dynamics. On one hand, the affordability challenges caused by higher interest rates are pushing some buyers, particularly first-time buyers, to the sidelines for now. On the other hand, more affluent buyers who are less fearful about rates are comfortable contracting for a home where they\u2019ve selected the lot, the floor plan, and the design options.  On the construction side, I\u2019m pleased to say that we continued to shorten our production cycle. Just to remind people, pre-COVID our production cycle was approximately 90 work days. At its worst, this number ballooned to 170 days. By the end of the quarter, we had reduced this number to about 140 days. Our teams continue to shave days and weeks off our build cycle and we remain optimistic about our ability to get back below 100 days in 2024. As you would expect, cutting more than a month off of our cycle time has positively impacted our cash flow, which we continue to allocate across our key business priorities. Through the first nine months of 2023, we have invested $3 billion in our business through land acquisition and development. Over this same period, we have returned over $800 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In this most recent quarter, we even took advantage of market conditions to retire $65 million of near term debt at prices just below par.  PulteGroup has delivered outstanding operating and financial performance in the quarter and throughout the first nine months of the year as we have leveraged our strong competitive position to capitalize on buyer demand. It grows increasingly clear that Federal Reserve actions to raise interest rates are having the desired effect of slowing the economy, although the speed of deceleration has been slower than expected given the unprecedented ramp in rates. While arguably not the most supportive economic backdrop, new home demand in 2023 has benefited from a robust jobs market and rising wages, financially resilient consumers and a continuing dearth of supply from the existing home market, and finally as higher rates begin to bite, we have responded with adjustments in product, pricing and incentive programs that successfully address consumers\u2019 biggest pain point, affordability. It\u2019s difficult to know if the Fed is done hiking rates for this economic cycle and trying to guess when they will move to cut rates is challenging, so we will remain disciplined in how we manage our business. We\u2019ll focus on serving our customers, supporting our employees, turning our assets and allocating capital appropriately while maintaining a strong and highly flexible capital position. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed analysis of our Q3 results. Bob?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan. PulteGroup\u2019s third quarter results add to what has been an exceptional year for the company as we have grown revenues and earnings, generating significant cash flow from operations, lowered our debt, and generally strengthened our entire operating platform. Specific to our third quarter, home sale revenues increased 3% over last year to $3.9 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter reflect a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000, in combination with a less than 1% increase in closings to 7,076 homes. The 2% gain in average sales price of homes closed in the quarter was driven by increases of 4% and 6% from move-up and active adult buyers respectively, partially offset by a 3% decrease among first-time buyers. The lower ASP among first-time buyer closings reflects our focus on remaining price competitive as interest rates have moved higher throughout the year. The mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed just slightly from the prior year as we continue to operate within the range of our stated mix of business. For the quarter, closings among first-time buyers represented 38% of the business, move-up buyers totaled 37%, and active adult buyers represented 25% of the homes closed. In the third quarter of last year, 36% of homes delivered were first-time, 38% were move-up, and 26% were active adult. Net new orders for the third quarter increased 43% over last year to 7.065 homes as we realized year-over-year gains in both units and absorption pace across all buyer groups. Orders among first-time buyers in the third quarter increased 53% over last year to 2,979 homes. The gain among move-up buyers was even greater as net new orders increased 56% to 2,524 homes, and finally on a comparable community count, we realized a double-digit gain in sales among active adult buyers as net new orders for the quarter increased to 1,562 homes.  In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 923 communities, which is up 12% over last year. Adjusting for community count, the monthly absorption pace in the third quarter averaged 2.5 homes, which is up from 2.0 homes per month in the third quarter of last year. As a percentage of beginning backload, our cancellation rate in the third quarter was 9% compared with 8% in the prior year. To be clear, on a unit basis cancellations in the third quarter were down more than 20% from last year, but the relative size of our backlog in each period results in the cancellation rate staying comparable.  Our unit backlog at the end of the quarter was 13,547 homes compared with 17,053 homes at the end of last year\u2019s third quarter. On a dollar basis, the value of our ending backlog was $8.1 billion, down from $10.6 billion in the third quarter of last year. At the end of the third quarter, we had a total of 17,376 homes under construction. This is down 24% from the same period last year as we strategically manage starts and realize the benefits of faster cycle times. Of the homes under construction, 61% were sold and 39% were spec units. As we have stated previously, we are comfortable putting spec units into production, but we are thoughtful about aligning the pace of starts with the pace of sales to help reduce the risk of putting too much inventory on the ground. Consistent with this measured approach to production, of the 6,700 spec homes currently under construction, fewer than 1,000 were finished. Given our Q3 community count of 923, we continue to carry approximately one finished spec per community, which is in line with our operating targets. Based on the homes we have in production and, as importantly, current sales trends, we expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. Delivering 8,000 homes in the fourth quarter would put us at 29,000 for the full year, which is down slightly from our previous guide for full-year closings to be 29,500 homes. The change in our guide reflects the more challenging affordability conditions resulting from higher rates as well as the slight shift in our mix toward build-to-order homes which won\u2019t deliver until 2024. Given the mix of homes we currently expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we expect our average sales price on closing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000 in the period. Our third quarter home sale gross margin of 29.5% continues to lead the industry as we successfully our turned our assets while still achieving high levels of profitability and driving higher returns on investment. PulteGroup\u2019s reported results benefited from strong margin performance across all buyer groups - first time, move-up, and active adult. Further, as we have talked about on prior calls, our diversified product portfolio is allowing us to capture higher gross margins that are typically available within our move-up and active adult communities. As I would remind everyone, our primary focus is always on driving higher returns on invested capital, but we appreciate margins are an important contributor to achieving such returns. This is why we remain disciplined in where we locate and how we underwrite our communities and how we design and build our houses, and in how we strategically price our homes in the marketplace.  Given the ongoing strength of our margins, we continue to get questions regarding relative margin performance among the larger public builders. I want to quickly address the line of thought that our margins benefit from land positions within our older Del Webb legacy communities. The reality is that the margins for these communities are comparable to the rest of our active adult business, but they are [indiscernible] our aggregate numbers. That being said, I\u2019m pleased to say that we expect to continue delivering high margins as we continue to expect home sale gross margins to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% in the fourth quarter. Given current interest rates, demand and cost dynamics, we would expect to be toward the lower end of this range. SG&A expenses in the third quarter totaled $353 million or 9.1% of home sale of revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $350 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues. Based on anticipated closing volumes for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8.8%. In the third quarter, pre-tax income from financial services was $29 million, up from $27.5 million last year. While market conditions remain highly competitive for our financial services operations, the business benefited from a higher capture rate of 84% compared with 77% last year. The large increase in capture rate relates to the expanded use of rate-based incentives, which are executed through our mortgage operations. Looking at our taxes, consistent with our prior guide, our third quarter tax expense was $209 million or an effective tax rate of 24.6%. For the fourth quarter, we continue to guide to a tax rate of 24.5%. PulteGroup\u2019s bottom line results show net income for the quarter of $639 million or $2.90 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $628 million or $2.69 per share.  Given the ongoing financial strength and cash flow generation of our business, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $300 million in the quarter. This was up from $180 million last year and $250 million in the second quarter of this year.  In the third quarter, we also elected to allocate capital towards paying down a portion of our debt. In total, we retired $65 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions at prices slightly below par. Inclusive of these transactions, we\u2019ve lowered our debt-to-capital ratio to 16.5%, which is down 220 basis points from the start of \u201923 and down 600 basis points from the third quarter of \u201922. Adjusting for the $1.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, our net debt to capital ratio was less than 1%.  Beyond buying back our equity and debt in the third quarter, we also invested $1.2 billion in the business through land acquisition and development, which keeps us on track to invest upwards of $4 billion for 2023. Almost two-thirds of our investment in the third quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Inclusive of our Q3 spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 53% are held via option. We continue to systematically rebuild the optionality of our land pipeline after having walked away from selective land positions in the back half of 2022. As part of this rebuilding process and consistent with our stated strategy of getting more land light, we are expanding our use of different land banking structures. To date, we have completed land banking transactions for approximately 5,000 lots. Going forward, we will look to use such land banking facilities in order to create optionality in situations where the underlying seller requires a bulk sale. It\u2019s a disciplined process as we work to balance land costs, returns and risk, but we are gaining momentum in our efforts. We are also getting more questions on our land pipeline, so let me add that about one-third of the lots we have under control are developed and we continue to develop most of the lots that we acquire. As a large homebuilder, assuming you\u2019re confident in the third party\u2019s ability to consistently deliver developed lots on time, the decision to purchase finished lots versus raw dirt comes down to return. Finished lots cost more but can turn faster, whereas the lower cost of undeveloped lots can drive higher margins, but the land is on balance sheet for a little longer. In all of our land transactions, we assess how best to drive higher risk-adjusted returns and to find opportunities and deals for finished and/or undeveloped lots. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan.\nRyan Marshall: As you would anticipate, given our 43% increase in net new orders, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter. Q3 displayed more typical seasonality than we have experienced in the three years since COVID as absorption pace eased as we moved through the quarter. Demand has been a little choppier in the first few weeks of October with more volatility in the day-to-day sales numbers.  I\u2019m sure for some buyers, higher rates have pushed affordability just that much further away, while others may be worried about their jobs. For other buyers, global unrest may simply have them thinking of other things. We are fortunate to have an experienced operating team that will make adjustments if and when needed.  On a year-over-year basis, for the first nine months of 2023, we have increased net income by $156 million and increased earnings by share by 17%. Over the same period, we\u2019ve increased our cash position by approximately $1.6 billion while dropping our net debt to capital ratio effectively to zero. Based on guidance that we\u2019ve given, we look forward to delivering exceptional full year results for 2023. From population growth and demographics to supply dynamics and the tremendous opportunity for wealth creation through home ownership, we are bullish on long term housing demand. Over the near term, however, we fully appreciate the affordability challenges being created by higher mortgage rates and the potential impacts from an economic slowdown the Federal Reserve is hoping to bring about. As such, we remain disciplined in how we operate our business particularly as it relates to investing in land, the pace of production, the allocation of capital, and the quality of homes and experience we deliver to our customers. We have a clear and successful operating model against which we have been executing for over a decade, so decision making throughout the organization is consistent and actions are implemented quickly. This strong organizational foundation along with tremendous financial strength has PulteGroup well positioned for ongoing success. In closing, I want to thank the entire team at PulteGroup for their tremendous efforts in delivering for our home buyers, our shareholders, and each other. I am so proud of what you accomplish every day. Let me turn the call back to Jim so we can begin Q&A.\nJames Zeumer: Thanks Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.  Abbie, we\u2019re ready to open for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open.\nCarl Reichardt : Thanks, good morning guys. I wanted to first just ask about the cycle time numbers - you talked about 140, trying to get down below 100 next year, so that\u2019s more than a month off. What specifically, Ryan, needs to happen for those numbers to go down? Where are the best and most obvious lever points?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Carl, so a lot of the work has already been done and what we\u2019re seeing is some of the homes that are delivering now, and maybe better said, the homes that are starting now are on cycle times that will yield that overall cycle time of below 100 days, so it\u2019s really about getting the older stuff that\u2019s been in the pipeline, that\u2019s got longer cycle times, that as those numbers close out, I think we\u2019ll see our overall cycle times come in line with that target of 100 days.\nCarl Reichardt: Right, thanks Ryan. Then you mentioned the choppiness in October, and I wonder if you could expand a little on that and talk a little bit, maybe about performance among the three segments in the month so far or particular markets, and then also from a cancellation perspective, if that\u2019s beginning to sort of impact you in October too. Thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Carl, happy to talk on October. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen sales in October, while good, they\u2019ve been a little bit choppier than--you know, the day-to-day kind of numbers have been a little choppier. I think the biggest thing that I\u2019d want you to hear is that similar to what we saw in the third quarter, we actually have seen a return to what we would consider seasonal type sign-up trends that we experienced pre-COVID, and we\u2019ve seen that continue into October. On an absorption rate, the numbers that we\u2019re seeing on absorptions per community are pretty similar to what we saw in 2018 and 2019 pre-COVID levels, which were pretty healthy, so all things considered, we feel pretty good about the continued ongoing desire for home ownership. It\u2019s not lost on any of you out there listening, rates matter, and there has been a lot of rate movement over the last 30 days, and so I think the consumer, all things considered, has handled that really well.\nCarl Reichardt: Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks, fellows.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley: Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a question around some of the comments you made at the top, Ryan, around addressing affordability and some of the challenges you\u2019re seeing, particularly with the first-time buyer. Any additional elaboration on what you\u2019re doing with incentives and rate buy-downs, and what\u2019s working and not working as we get into September and October, and sort of the margin implications of all that? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Matt, thanks for the question. We continue to use the permanent 30-year buy-down as probably our most powerful incentive. Right now, we\u2019ve got national incentives that offer 5.75% on a 30-year fixed, so I think given rates today on the open market would be over 8%, to be able to get a new home in a great location of the quality and design features that we have at 5.75%, I think is pretty powerful. I\u2019ll remind everybody, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve simply redistributed incentives that we\u2019ve historically offered toward cabinets and countertops and things of that nature, we\u2019ve redirected those to interest rate incentives, and I think that\u2019s the--you know, that\u2019s been the most powerful thing for that buyer group.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it, okay. That\u2019s really helpful.  Then secondly, just one on stick and brick costs - you know, just as you\u2019re addressing these issues and presumably there is margin pressure out of that, and the housing market has evolved here, what are you guys doing around construction costs, labor, sort of ability to push back on all that? How should we think about that over these next few months? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, well you know, look - inflation is real, and we\u2019ve previously talked about something in the neighborhood of 8% to 9% year-over-year inflation, which I think is part of the reason we\u2019re in the rate environment that we\u2019re in as the Fed\u2019s trying to get a handle on that. What we\u2019ve seen on our cost to build is on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re actually flat. Now, that\u2019s a lot of commodity and material and labor increase in a number of categories that\u2019s been offset by lumber save, so headline is we\u2019re flat on a price per square foot to build year-over-year, but it\u2019s a lot of increases in material and labor offset by lumber.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it, thanks Ryan. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just wanted to kind of take a step back and understand some of the dynamics. You talk about October being choppy, but at the same time it sounds like more in line with seasonality pre-COVID, and you also--you know, the flipside of that is with volume, you\u2019re putting out a gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter maybe a touch down from 3Q. Can you just give us a sense of the level of incentives, if through your own offerings in October or maybe even more broadly in the marketplace, do you feel like incentives have started to come up over the last couple of months because certainly, I guess in the near term, you\u2019re looking for a similar gross margin, and maybe just more broadly how you feel the market is reacting to September and October?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, I\u2019ll take part of that and then I\u2019ll have Bob talk about the incentive load. As demonstrated by our orders in the quarter, we had 43% growth in new orders and it was a number of over 7,000, so I think we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated that we\u2019ve got the ability to sell homes. You\u2019ve heard me talk about not being margin proud, but at the same time, we\u2019re not going to give away price and incentives that we don\u2019t have to, and I think we did exactly that in the third quarter and we\u2019d continue to focus on making sure that we\u2019re turning the asset and we\u2019re getting the number of absorptions that we need in every single community to deliver the best return on invested capital that we can. Look, I think it was a great quarter. We\u2019re happy with how sign-ups performed in October - you know, you heard me kind of talk about that on the question that Carl asked, so I won\u2019t repeat it. Then Bob, if you can, maybe just talk a little bit about the incentive load. \nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Mike, you know, you can see in our data we\u2019ve got about a 6% incentive load - that\u2019s $35,000 a unit, rough math. That actually is down 10 basis points from Q2 of this year. It is certainly up - it was 2.2% last year, but the sales environment that led to the closings in Q3 of last year was dramatically different, so you can see kind of a normalization here at 6%.  I think you can take from our margin guidance for Q3 what we see closing in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility into that at this moment, will not be significantly impactful. I would highlight that we\u2019ve given a continuation of that same guide at 29.5% on margins. We have told you we\u2019re going to be at the lower end of that, so there is some cost to this interest rate environment. \nMichael Rehaut: Right - no, appreciate that, Bob. I guess secondly, maybe bigger picture conceptually, you talked about earlier in the call questions around your higher gross margin versus your peer group. When you think about the 6% today versus 2% a year ago, and I don\u2019t know if that 6%, I want to say it\u2019s a little bit above your longer term average maybe around 3%, how does that square with the level of gross margins you\u2019re generating today, and if you think about over the next couple years, we\u2019ve heard different things from different builders about maybe increasing hurdle rates from underwriting about--you know, just thinking about higher cost land perhaps might flow through over the next couple years. You know, if incentive levels stay where they are, would that suggest kind of a moderation a little bit from the current level of gross margins, or how should we think conceptually about the next couple of years directionally for this metric?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Mike, our crystal ball at this point, a couple of years out, we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re still kind of focused on Q4. We\u2019ve given a guide for that quarter, when we get to kind of the end of Q4, we\u2019ll certainly give a full year guide for the balance of 2024, but maybe the thing I do want to address is the incentive load that we currently have, that is allowing us to offer incentives on the interest rate, that\u2019s been in our margin guide and our results for the entire year.  You\u2019re seeing the impact of offering below-market interest rates as an incentive. It\u2019s been in Q2 results, it was in our Q3 results and it\u2019s in our Q4 guide, so no guidance about what margins direction will be beyond Q4 of this year, but that\u2019s all embedded in our--you know, to this point, everything that we\u2019ve been doing, that\u2019s embedded in the results that we\u2019ve delivered and the guide that we\u2019ve given.\nMichael Rehaut: Appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the data point about the active adult community in Michigan - hopefully snow removal is included in that HOA fee!\nRyan Marshall: In fact it is, Joe.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Good.  Look, market conditions, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine the margin volume and price into next year. I think it\u2019s an under-appreciated element of your business. Of course, the composition of that can vary, right, within the definition of success, but you are obviously appropriately acknowledging the headwinds here. Maybe if you could just talk instead to the return headwind from this, instead of either the absorption headwind or the gross margin headwind, just how are you thinking about returns on capital, and then similarly returns on inventory if interest rates remain high? You\u2019re basically at net zero debt now. Just how you\u2019re thinking about ROE relative to ROI.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Joe, thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll do my best to give you an answer. For the last decade, maybe even going on 12 years, the way that we\u2019ve operated the business has been with a singular focus on delivering the best possible return on invested capital that we can. Given the capital intensive nature of this business, for us we think that\u2019s the best way to make decisions and to operationalize our platform in a way that delivers high return on assets, high return on equity, whatever metric you want to look at. I think we\u2019ve clearly done that. I highlighted in my prepared remarks that for the trailing 12 months, we delivered return on equity over 30%, and part of that derived from running a good business but also a very thoughtful and disciplined way in allocating capital, which includes things beyond just buying land and building homes. We are paying a dividend, we\u2019ve bought back near 45% of the company over the last 10 to 12 years that we\u2019ve had our share buyback program in place, and we just highlighted this quarter we opportunistically took advantage of the opportunity to buy some debt in, near term debt in that was trading below par. You know, I think maybe the best way I can describe it, Joe, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on buying assets in great spots, turning those in a way that delivers high return on invested capital, and one of the other things that I think can also continue to give us flexibility and return-enhancing leverage is moving our land options to 70%, so. We sit at 53% today, we\u2019ve given you kind of a long term target of 70%. We\u2019ve got things in place and work underway that will help us get there.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Appreciate all those thoughts, Ryan. As a follow-up, just maybe on the comment around matching starts to orders, should we interpret that as roughly 7,000 starts in the fourth quarter, or is that more of a comment on what the fourth quarter orders look like, that\u2019s what your starts might look like?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, fourth quarter starts will be more reflective of order trends that we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re starting more spec than we historically have. We\u2019ve highlighted that we\u2019ve completely moved our first-time business to a spec business, so some of that\u2019s predetermined based on what we saw in the third quarter and what we would anticipate. But we\u2019re just not going to get into kind of a position where we\u2019ve got a build-up of spec inventory that creates pressure to do things that are unnatural on the pricing, but we are going to put some units in the ground to have those ready for Q1. You saw us do that last year, in the back half of last year that set us up for a really strong Q1 of 2023, so. You know, I\u2019d want you to hear balanced approach, inventories going into the ground, we\u2019re going to have it ready for Q1, but we are going to be responsive to some of the headwinds that we\u2019ve acknowledged are out there in this current rate environment.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Sounds good, thanks a lot.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much, guys. Great job, exciting times. Ryan, in your opening remarks, you sort of talked about some of the reasons why--you know, some of the ways in which buyers seem to be responding to the rates, and you sort of contrasted or laid out that there\u2019s a psychological component, maybe math versus mental. I\u2019m curious--and you talked about the role of buy-downs in that, so my first question relates to how you think--let\u2019s do it this way. What percent of your buyers are taking a rate buy-down, and when you\u2019re negotiating these buy-downs, you\u2019ve talked about the 5.75% through the end o this year, it looks like, where are you setting new lots, because I imagine you\u2019re negotiating those now for the next batch, where are you setting those lots from a contracted rate perspective?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, hey Stephen, it\u2019s Bob. It\u2019s an evergreen process, honestly. We are buying contracts typically weekly, actually, and they are market-based. We set the pricing on that, and that determines the price to us to offer that value to the consumer, so the rate that Ryan talked about is a negotiated price and essentially we fill the cost of being able to provide that contract rate to our consumer. There is an upfront fee for purchasing the contract and then there is the rate buy-down as part of that, and so it\u2019s a--you know, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re buying now for three and six months from now. These are contracts that we enter into that we expect to build, candidly, within 30 days, and typically we\u2019re filling them within a week, so it\u2019s a--you know, it\u2019s very market responsive. As rates go up, it\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve offered has moved up a little bit. We\u2019ve increased our cost as part of that to a degree, so it\u2019s a process we\u2019ve been working through for, gosh, 10 or 11 months now since we put it in place, and we\u2019ve found it works pretty well.\nStephen Kim: Just so I\u2019m understanding that, it sounds like what you\u2019re talking about is you have a forward purchase commitment that you\u2019re doing on a relatively short term basis, but then you\u2019re also layering on top of that an individual rate buy-down, sort of ad hoc, if you will.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: These are 30-year rate buy-downs for the consumer. \nRyan Marshall: Stephen, the other thing that I\u2019d maybe just add to your conversation is some buyers, you know, they take the available incentives that we have that get them all the way to 5.75%. There are other buyers that decide that they don\u2019t need to go all the way to 5.75% and they\u2019d like to have a little bit higher rate and use some of the other incentive money that we\u2019re offering for other things that they see value in. We\u2019re seeing about 80% to 85% of our buyers are getting some form of incentive towards interest rates. That doesn\u2019t mean everybody will go to 5.75%. Just some fraction of our total sales end up in that very lowest category.  The big headline is that we\u2019ve got the tools out there and our sales team has got the tools out there to help individually solve what each and every buyer needs to make the transaction work for them.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Maybe to put a finer point on that, as Ryan said, 80% to 85% of the people have an incentive program, only 25% of the business in the quarter was through that national campaign that you asked about, so. Those are targeted to specific inventory units typically, but we offer incentives to all of our consumers - we always have, and as Ryan has stated already today, the vast majority of those incentives now across all of our buyers is financing-oriented. \nStephen Kim: Yes, okay. That was really helpful. Appreciate all the nuances there. My second question relates to getting back to sort of the seasonality. It sounds like you\u2019ve acknowledged that seasonality is sort of coming back into the business. In the fourth quarter, it\u2019s a little weird, right, because the housing market kind of generally slows, particularly in the last six weeks of the year, and I\u2019m curious as to your posture as you assess the buyers. Are you anticipating--do you generally think that there\u2019s relatively more inelasticity on the part of the buyer, or relatively less elasticity might be a better way of saying it, so that it causes you maybe not to push so aggressively on incentives to try to keep up sales momentum in the last six weeks of the year, kind of like pushing on a string. Is that a reasonable way to be thinking about how you\u2019re likely to approach the market over the next six weeks--I\u2019m sorry, in the last six weeks of the year? Then lastly, regarding risk, you had talked about wanting to evaluate all of your land actions in terms of risk adjusted returns, but you\u2019re also running at a super low net debt to cap, and I\u2019m curious if you move to lower risk through increased incentive--you know, increased land banking, would it be reasonable to think you\u2019ll also carry increased leverage than you currently are today?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Stephen, we are at a very--we\u2019re at a lower leverage rate than what we\u2019ve historically run at. I think that really more than anything, it\u2019s a testament to the strength of the business. We\u2019ve been operating really well and we have been generating a lot of cash. We\u2019ve really been touching kind of all the critical parts of our capital allocation philosophy. We\u2019ve invested a lot of money into land and land development, we\u2019ve been paying our dividend, we\u2019ve bought back the highest single quarter spend in shares this year in the third quarter at $300 million, and we bought back some debt, and with that, we still grew the cash balance, so I think it really demonstrates how strong the business is operating. In terms of your question on pricing and discounts and elasticity or inelasticity, we\u2019re going to continue to price and set incentives at a level that we think is appropriate for the market. We\u2019re going to be responsive, we\u2019re not going to be margin proud. At the same time, I think we\u2019ve got a good understanding of what value is, and you shouldn\u2019t expect to see kind of the national year-end blowout, red tag kind of screaming baby sale from us - I don\u2019t think that helps the consumer. But I think you\u2019re seeing us put the appropriate incentive load such that we\u2019re turning the asset, we\u2019re turning the inventory, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re getting a minimum of two sales per active community, which is kind of the level that I think you need to be at in production homebuilding to deliver the types of return on assets, return on inventory, return on invested capital that we want.\nStephen Kim: Perfect, appreciate that. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.\nKen Zener: Good morning everybody. \nRyan Marshall: Morning Ken.\nKen Zener: Just want to delve into the option impact on your margins. I think you\u2019ve been saying options have been about 19% of your ASP. Is that still where we\u2019re at in terms of the options?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: We\u2019ve talked about our options and lot premiums being a consistent driver of value. It\u2019s part of the way we go to market. We think it\u2019s one of the strengths of our sales process. In the most recent quarter, that was $107,000, it\u2019s up $3,000 sequentially and year-over-year, so that is still part of our sales operation. It\u2019s how we go to market, and yes, 20% is roughly where we are. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change as long as market dynamics stay where they are.\nKen Zener: Right, and so I guess--you know, what we talked about since last quarter was options are obviously higher margin, one can imply that\u2019s accounting for historically that 300 or 400 basis point lift of gross margins versus peers, so as that option mix, can you kind of relate--you know, what is the cost of or what was the drag specifically for all these mortgage rate buy-downs? You know, 5.75% versus the 8% now, what is the net impact on your gross margin? I realize it\u2019s part of incentives, but if you could quantify that. Then what is the actual distribution of that? It seems like an active adult paying cash doesn\u2019t need it, so is that largely occurring in the first-time buyer? I heard the 80%, but I\u2019m just trying to understand that spread of usage relative to these options, which are structurally a good tailwind for you. That\u2019s one, and then second, your mention of finished lots, very interesting because you\u2019re return focused, so I think the street\u2019s too focused on margin, not focused enough on turns. Did you have, or what percent of closings in the quarter came from finished lots, and what\u2019s the margin impact of that as well? I appreciate you answering those two sets of questions. \nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Ken, there\u2019s a lot there. Let me start with--I had highlighted this before, our incentive load is about 6%, $35,000, so that would tell you 6.3%, something like that, and again I think we\u2019ve highlighted the majority of that incentive is rate buy-down for financing support, so I think that\u2019s the answer to your first question. I apologize -your second question was, I think what percentage of our--\nKen Zener: Right, you were talking returns, right? You\u2019re a return-based company, even though the street and you guys focus a lot on margins. To the extent the first-time buyer, more spec, finished lots so you get better terms, you guys mentioned finished lots, I believe for the first time, so what is the impact of the finished lots? Are you closing finished lots? What type of margin impact is that?\nRyan Marshall: Ken, it\u2019s Ryan, I\u2019ll jump in on that. We haven\u2019t sliced the bologna quite that thin, and I won\u2019t attempt to do it on this call. We are a return-focused company. There is no change there. I think we\u2019ve been the purveyors of the message, we don\u2019t focus on margin, it\u2019s a component of the overall operating model. We\u2019re focused on return, and depending on the number of units we sell in a particular community and how quickly you turn the asset, if you do that fast enough, then it can offset and you can allow for lower gross margins. If you\u2019re getting a lot just in time and somebody else is developing it and carrying it, and we can build in the hundred days that we\u2019re talking about, it allows us to run a high returning business at a lower margin. That\u2019s not a new concept, that\u2019s exactly what we do, and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll continue to do.\nOperator: As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We will take our next question from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, so rates at 8% today, you guys are buying down to 5.75%. Can you just remind us, last quarter when rates were closer to 7%, what level you were buying down to?\nRyan Marshall: Yes John, we were--I think the lowest we were was 5%, 5.25% at a national level. We had some specific markets that may have been sub-5% at 4.99%, but basically as you\u2019ve seen the headline rate move from 7.5% to 8%, you\u2019ve seen our promotional rate move up by that same 50 basis points.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, and you would anticipate probably taking that same strategy as we move forward, if rates were to move up?\nRyan Marshall: I think generally, that\u2019s a good rule of thumb. I mean, there is--I think practically speaking, there\u2019s a limit to how much money you can throw at the rate relative to what the headline number is.\nJohn Lovallo: Makes sense, and then the second question is just on community count, how you\u2019re thinking about that through the remainder of this year, and maybe any initial thoughts as we move into next year.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I think very consistent with what we\u2019ve said, we think we\u2019ll be up 5% to 10% over fourth quarter of last year.\nRyan Marshall: And then we haven\u2019t given anything for \u201924 yet, John, but as we\u2019ve said in the past, you can see the capital that we\u2019ve spent, for the land that we\u2019ve spent this year, a pretty good indicator of what community count will be in the future, or you can use as a proxy for what community count can turn into in the future.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it, thank you guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Dahl: Morning, thanks for taking my questions. Ryan, just to pick up on one of your last responses in terms of the practical limit on how much you can throw at the rate buy-down. I mean, we\u2019ve heard different things from different builders, depending on whether you\u2019re doing fewer buy-downs versus the forward purchase commitments which I think you alluded to earlier, and kind of what is and isn\u2019t considered seller contributions, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the details of how you\u2019re executing in the case of going down to 5.75%, how you\u2019re executing that? Is it--like, how much is allocated towards the forward purchase commitment versus the pure points, and do you consider the purchase commitments and the cost of that as part of your seller contributions?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, so I don\u2019t want to give away all of our trade secrets on that, but suffice it to say there are different rules based on who is--depending on which government agency rules you\u2019re using for that mortgage program. For the upfront fees that we\u2019re paying on a forward commitment, because those are done prior to having a home under contract, those fees do not count toward seller contribution; but there are additional incentives that have to be applied to the deal--that do have to be applied to the deal once the home\u2019s under contract, those do certainly count towards the seller contribution, so to get to 5.75%, you\u2019ve got some fees on the front end, you\u2019ve got some fees on the back end. We do look at them in the aggregate, and those are the numbers that you\u2019re hearing Bob talk about.\nMichael Dahl: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then my follow-up is if we think about the movement in rates, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve looked at it this way, and I\u2019ll ask it in a historical context year-to-date, if you look at your year-to-date orders or closings, maybe let\u2019s focus on closings, have you run an analysis of how many of those buyers just wouldn\u2019t have qualified at today\u2019s rates versus the rates that you were able to get them year-to-date?\nRyan Marshall: No, we haven\u2019t run that analysis, no. I would highlight that no matter the rate that we\u2019re offering, we qualify the buyer on the 30-year, so a lot of the incentives that we\u2019ve been doing have been 30-year fixed rate, so that is the rate we\u2019re qualifying, but in the case that you do a temporary buy-down, the buyer is qualified at what the permanent 30-year rate will be. I think everybody knows that, but I think it\u2019s worth highlighting because we don\u2019t--none of us wants to see the industry back in a situation that we were in, in 2008.\nMichael Dahl: Right.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Alan Ratner of Zelman and Associates. Your line is open.\nAlan Zelman: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the info so far. Switching gears a little bit, I guess what I\u2019d like to hear your opinion on is maybe what opportunities could potentially come about from this recent, I guess, softening or choppiness that you\u2019re describing. Your balance sheet is obviously in fantastic shape, so is pretty much the rest of the public industry, but we are hearing anecdotes of AD&C capital tightening up for private operators and land developers, and we\u2019re hearing build-for-rent deals potentially falling out of favor here. Have you started to see any increase in either distressed or opportunities that you feel like you might be able to take advantage of, if these current conditions persist for a handful of quarters?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Alan, I think we\u2019re hearing the same things that you are, particularly on maybe availability of capital or the cost of capital on the land development side. There\u2019s definitely, I think, some strain or tightness in that arena. I think that certainly might continue to create an opportunity the longer that we stay in a high rate environment.  I think it\u2019s also a great opportunity for us to take market share. With our mortgage company, the size of our balance sheet, the ability to be active in the capital markets, I think it gives us an opportunity to do things that smaller local builders and maybe private builders can\u2019t, so I think there is certainly a market share opportunity there as well. We\u2019ve made build-to-rent a small piece of our business. We\u2019ve got good relationships with national partners that we\u2019re building some percentage of our annual deliveries for those operators, and I think we\u2019ve talked extensively about that, that it will continue to be an arrow in our operational quiver.  Look - I\u2019m really, really confident and pleased with the way we\u2019re operating. The health of the business, the volume that we\u2019re selling in kind of the core operations, and then when you go to the balance sheet, I think we\u2019re set up to do a lot of great things that will continue to set us up for success down the road.\nAlan Zelman: That\u2019s helpful, Ryan. Then I guess other builders have kind of put out an absorption target that they manage their business to, that tends to be maybe more the spec guys, entry level, where volume is certainly more of a consideration. But I\u2019m curious, when you think about your price outlook and your margin profile and where your incentives are currently running at, right now you\u2019re absorption pace is you\u2019re probably going to be in the mid-2s somewhere. Is there a level where, if that pace dips below, that you would get much more aggressive on incentives, discounts, and even adjust base prices again? What would that level look like?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Alan, it\u2019s a good question. The thing that I talk about with our operators, and I spend a lot of time in the field in our communities, in our division offices talking about exactly this, the mantra that we have inside the company is a minimum of two sales in every community. Now, certainly we have certain price points in communities that sell way more than two per community, but as a production homebuilder, it\u2019s hard to have an active store that does less than two, you just--you know, you can\u2019t make the returns work to the level of our expectations.  Below two per active community, that\u2019s where we start looking at, hey, we are positioned right, do we have the right incentives, do we have the right pricing, do we have the right product, are we going after the right consumer? There\u2019s a number of those levers that we pull, but it nets out to for this quarter, we were 2.5, but that two per community is kind of the level that we look at.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTruman Patterson: Hey, good morning everyone, and Ryan, the screaming baby sale got me - I think that kid\u2019s probably in high school or college by now. \nRyan Marshall: We\u2019re going to the way-back machine, Truman.\nTruman Patterson: Exactly, exactly. You all--I\u2019m trying to understand, your orders for entry level were performing well in the third quarter - I think you said up, like, 53% year-over-year, but then you mentioned some more cautious commentary about that buyer. I\u2019m just hoping maybe big picture, if you could help us think through the monthly incentives needed for that buyer cohort versus you mentioned active adult, maybe move-up, more affluent, not needing quite as much. I\u2019m just hoping you can help us just kind of understand these bigger trends that you\u2019re seeing near term.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Truman, look, I think we\u2019re really pleased with what our first-time business is doing. We\u2019ve invested in it, and we\u2019ve said our target was to get it to kind of 40% of our business, and we\u2019ve done that. I think you\u2019ve seen not only growth in absorptions but growth in communities, and the business is about where we\u2019d like it to be. On one hand, that buyer doesn\u2019t have a home to sell, they\u2019re not locked into a low interest rate that they\u2019re reluctant to get rid of, so I think that\u2019s the positive with that first-time buyer. In terms of the headwinds, I think it\u2019s obvious - it\u2019s 8% interest rates, and that\u2019s a buyer that\u2019s got a down payment, hopefully, either they\u2019ve saved it or it\u2019s been gifted to them by parents, and then they\u2019re going and getting a 30-year mortgage and they\u2019re working on what they can afford based on their wages. The good news is wages are going up, which is helping affordability, but beyond rate-rate-rate, there\u2019s probably not a bunch more that I could add in terms of the first-time buyer. Maybe just the last thing on the overall rate environment, look, high rates aren\u2019t good for the consumer, they\u2019re not good for housing, they\u2019re not good for the broader economy, but we\u2019re all kind of playing in the same environment and with the quality of the management team that we have and the way that we\u2019re operating this company, I think we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019ve got the tools and the operational flexibility to be successful in any environment. This most recent quarter is a great example of that.\nTruman Patterson: Okay, perfect. Then Ryan, you mentioned adjusting product given the higher rates. I\u2019m hoping you could elaborate on what all that entails for Pulte specifically. Then if I\u2019m reading between the lines, spec sales were about 49% of your overall bucket this quarter - that\u2019s a pretty good run rate that you all expect going forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, so in terms of product, Truman, the one great thing about our product portfolio is we offer a lot of flexibility to scale up, scale down. We offer structural options that allow a smaller floor plan with added square footage in the form of loft or additional flex space. We\u2019ve got the ability to take a base floor plan, scale it up or scale it down, and we\u2019re seeing buyers use that flexibility to help address some of the affordability challenges that are out there. In our--the way that we sell options, we see buyers pick the things that they see value in, and we\u2019re also seeing buyers make trade-offs in terms of how they spend those dollars, in terms of cabinets, countertops, upgrades, etc.  The last piece of your question, Truman, remind me again?\nTruman Patterson: Your spec strategy, should we kind of assume that it\u2019s pretty much stable from here, that you\u2019re targeting about half the business perhaps as spec?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, roughly. I think that\u2019s a good go-forward run rate. It\u2019s higher than what we experienced pre-COVID - that\u2019s mostly reflective of the size of our first-time business and entirely moving that to spec. We did highlight this quarter, 49% - that\u2019s down from about 60% earlier in the year, so we feel pretty good about that performance in the spec business.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Okay, appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. Sorry we couldn\u2019t get through to all the questions, but we\u2019re certainly available over the remainder of the day for follow-up, and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks Ryan. PulteGroup's third quarter results add to what has been an exceptional year for the company as we have grown revenues and earnings, generating significant cash flow from operations, lowered our debt, and generally strengthened our entire operating platform. Specific to our third quarter, home sale revenues increased 3% over last year to $3.9 billion. Higher revenues for the quarter reflect a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000, in combination with a less than 1% increase in closings to 7,076 homes. The 2% gain in average sales price of homes closed in the quarter was driven by increases of 4% and 6% from move-up and active adult buyers respectively, partially offset by a 3% decrease among first-time buyers. The lower ASP among first-time buyer closings reflects our focus on remaining price competitive as interest rates have moved higher throughout the year. The mix of homes delivered in the third quarter changed just slightly from the prior year as we continue to operate within the range of our stated mix of business. For the quarter, closings among first-time buyers represented 38% of the business, move-up buyers totaled 37%, and active adult buyers represented 25% of the homes closed. In the third quarter of last year, 36% of homes delivered were first-time, 38% were move-up, and 26% were active adult. Net new orders for the third quarter increased 43% over last year to 7.065 homes as we realized year-over-year gains in both units and absorption pace across all buyer groups. Orders among first-time buyers in the third quarter increased 53% over last year to 2,979 homes. The gain among move-up buyers was even greater as net new orders increased 56% to 2,524 homes, and finally on a comparable community count, we realized a double-digit gain in sales among active adult buyers as net new orders for the quarter increased to 1,562 homes.  In the third quarter, we operated from an average of 923 communities, which is up 12% over last year. Adjusting for community count, the monthly absorption pace in the third quarter averaged 2.5 homes, which is up from 2.0 homes per month in the third quarter of last year. As a percentage of beginning backload, our cancellation rate in the third quarter was 9% compared with 8% in the prior year. To be clear, on a unit basis cancellations in the third quarter were down more than 20% from last year, but the relative size of our backlog in each period results in the cancellation rate staying comparable.  Our unit backlog at the end of the quarter was 13,547 homes compared with 17,053 homes at the end of last year's third quarter. On a dollar basis, the value of our ending backlog was $8.1 billion, down from $10.6 billion in the third quarter of last year. At the end of the third quarter, we had a total of 17,376 homes under construction. This is down 24% from the same period last year as we strategically manage starts and realize the benefits of faster cycle times. Of the homes under construction, 61% were sold and 39% were spec units. As we have stated previously, we are comfortable putting spec units into production, but we are thoughtful about aligning the pace of starts with the pace of sales to help reduce the risk of putting too much inventory on the ground. Consistent with this measured approach to production, of the 6,700 spec homes currently under construction, fewer than 1,000 were finished. Given our Q3 community count of 923, we continue to carry approximately one finished spec per community, which is in line with our operating targets. Based on the homes we have in production and, as importantly, current sales trends, we expect closings in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8,000 homes. Delivering 8,000 homes in the fourth quarter would put us at 29,000 for the full year, which is down slightly from our previous guide for full-year closings to be 29,500 homes. The change in our guide reflects the more challenging affordability conditions resulting from higher rates as well as the slight shift in our mix toward build-to-order homes which won't deliver until 2024. Given the mix of homes we currently expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, we expect our average sales price on closing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000 in the period. Our third quarter home sale gross margin of 29.5% continues to lead the industry as we successfully our turned our assets while still achieving high levels of profitability and driving higher returns on investment. PulteGroup's reported results benefited from strong margin performance across all buyer groups - first time, move-up, and active adult. Further, as we have talked about on prior calls, our diversified product portfolio is allowing us to capture higher gross margins that are typically available within our move-up and active adult communities. As I would remind everyone, our primary focus is always on driving higher returns on invested capital, but we appreciate margins are an important contributor to achieving such returns. This is why we remain disciplined in where we locate and how we underwrite our communities and how we design and build our houses, and in how we strategically price our homes in the marketplace.  Given the ongoing strength of our margins, we continue to get questions regarding relative margin performance among the larger public builders. I want to quickly address the line of thought that our margins benefit from land positions within our older Del Webb legacy communities. The reality is that the margins for these communities are comparable to the rest of our active adult business, but they are [indiscernible] our aggregate numbers. That being said, I'm pleased to say that we expect to continue delivering high margins as we continue to expect home sale gross margins to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% in the fourth quarter. Given current interest rates, demand and cost dynamics, we would expect to be toward the lower end of this range. SG&A expenses in the third quarter totaled $353 million or 9.1% of home sale of revenues. This compares with prior year SG&A expense of $350 million or 9.2% of home sale revenues. Based on anticipated closing volumes for the fourth quarter, we expect SG&A in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8.8%. In the third quarter, pre-tax income from financial services was $29 million, up from $27.5 million last year. While market conditions remain highly competitive for our financial services operations, the business benefited from a higher capture rate of 84% compared with 77% last year. The large increase in capture rate relates to the expanded use of rate-based incentives, which are executed through our mortgage operations. Looking at our taxes, consistent with our prior guide, our third quarter tax expense was $209 million or an effective tax rate of 24.6%. For the fourth quarter, we continue to guide to a tax rate of 24.5%. PulteGroup's bottom line results show net income for the quarter of $639 million or $2.90 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $628 million or $2.69 per share.  Given the ongoing financial strength and cash flow generation of our business, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $300 million in the quarter. This was up from $180 million last year and $250 million in the second quarter of this year.  In the third quarter, we also elected to allocate capital towards paying down a portion of our debt. In total, we retired $65 million of our 2026 and 2027 senior notes through open market transactions at prices slightly below par. Inclusive of these transactions, we've lowered our debt-to-capital ratio to 16.5%, which is down 220 basis points from the start of '23 and down 600 basis points from the third quarter of '22. Adjusting for the $1.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, our net debt to capital ratio was less than 1%.  Beyond buying back our equity and debt in the third quarter, we also invested $1.2 billion in the business through land acquisition and development, which keeps us on track to invest upwards of $4 billion for 2023. Almost two-thirds of our investment in the third quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Inclusive of our Q3 spend, we ended the quarter with approximately 223,000 lots under control, of which 53% are held via option. We continue to systematically rebuild the optionality of our land pipeline after having walked away from selective land positions in the back half of 2022. As part of this rebuilding process and consistent with our stated strategy of getting more land light, we are expanding our use of different land banking structures. To date, we have completed land banking transactions for approximately 5,000 lots. Going forward, we will look to use such land banking facilities in order to create optionality in situations where the underlying seller requires a bulk sale. It's a disciplined process as we work to balance land costs, returns and risk, but we are gaining momentum in our efforts. We are also getting more questions on our land pipeline, so let me add that about one-third of the lots we have under control are developed and we continue to develop most of the lots that we acquire. As a large homebuilder, assuming you're confident in the third party's ability to consistently deliver developed lots on time, the decision to purchase finished lots versus raw dirt comes down to return. Finished lots cost more but can turn faster, whereas the lower cost of undeveloped lots can drive higher margins, but the land is on balance sheet for a little longer. In all of our land transactions, we assess how best to drive higher risk-adjusted returns and to find opportunities and deals for finished and/or undeveloped lots. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan. Yes Mike, you know, you can see in our data we've got about a 6% incentive load - that's $35,000 a unit, rough math. That actually is down 10 basis points from Q2 of this year. It is certainly up - it was 2.2% last year, but the sales environment that led to the closings in Q3 of last year was dramatically different, so you can see kind of a normalization here at 6%.  I think you can take from our margin guidance for Q3 what we see closing in the fourth quarter, and we've got pretty good visibility into that at this moment, will not be significantly impactful. I would highlight that we've given a continuation of that same guide at 29.5% on margins. We have told you we're going to be at the lower end of that, so there is some cost to this interest rate environment. Yes, hey Stephen, it's Bob. It's an evergreen process, honestly. We are buying contracts typically weekly, actually, and they are market-based. We set the pricing on that, and that determines the price to us to offer that value to the consumer, so the rate that Ryan talked about is a negotiated price and essentially we fill the cost of being able to provide that contract rate to our consumer. There is an upfront fee for purchasing the contract and then there is the rate buy-down as part of that, and so it's a--you know, it's not like we're buying now for three and six months from now. These are contracts that we enter into that we expect to build, candidly, within 30 days, and typically we're filling them within a week, so it's a--you know, it's very market responsive. As rates go up, it's why you've seen what we've offered has moved up a little bit. We've increased our cost as part of that to a degree, so it's a process we've been working through for, gosh, 10 or 11 months now since we put it in place, and we've found it works pretty well. These are 30-year rate buy-downs for the consumer. Maybe to put a finer point on that, as Ryan said, 80% to 85% of the people have an incentive program, only 25% of the business in the quarter was through that national campaign that you asked about, so. Those are targeted to specific inventory units typically, but we offer incentives to all of our consumers - we always have, and as Ryan has stated already today, the vast majority of those incentives now across all of our buyers is financing-oriented. We've talked about our options and lot premiums being a consistent driver of value. It's part of the way we go to market. We think it's one of the strengths of our sales process. In the most recent quarter, that was $107,000, it's up $3,000 sequentially and year-over-year, so that is still part of our sales operation. It's how we go to market, and yes, 20% is roughly where we are. I wouldn't expect that to change as long as market dynamics stay where they are. Ken, there's a lot there. Let me start with--I had highlighted this before, our incentive load is about 6%, $35,000, so that would tell you 6.3%, something like that, and again I think we've highlighted the majority of that incentive is rate buy-down for financing support, so I think that's the answer to your first question. I apologize -your second question was, I think what percentage of our-- Yes, I think very consistent with what we've said, we think we'll be up 5% to 10% over fourth quarter of last year."

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks Jim and good morning. As we will discuss over the next several minutes, PulteGroup reported another quarter of outstanding and, for a number of key metrics, record financial results.  Our financial performance demonstrates once again the importance of PulteGroup's balanced and differentiated operating model. Leveraging our broad geographic footprint and diversified product offering, we are working to maintain significant market share among all major buyer groups.  At the same time, we are successfully executing both large scale spec and build-to-order homebuilding businesses. Our spec business allows us to more cost efficiently serve first-time buyers, while our build-to-order business caters to move-up and active adult buyers looking to personalize their home location and design features.  Specific to our financial results, I am extremely proud of our entire organization for their efforts in delivering third quarter results that include a 43% increase in orders, industry-leading gross margins of 29.5%, record third quarter earnings of $2.90 per share, and a return on equity that exceeded 30%.  In the quarter, I would highlight our active adult business as an important contributor to our sign-up growth and our gross margin performance. In an operating environment where rising mortgage rates are creating increasing affordability challenges, 47% of our Del Webb purchasers were cash buyers. This is up from 33% just two years ago. Along with largely being cash buyers, these were customers who can afford the premium lots and upgrades that make active adult our highest margin business. Just to demonstrate the brand power of the Del Webb name, in June we opened Del Webb Kensington Ridge in Michigan, not a market you might consider a hotspot for retirees. In a community where base home prices range from $370,000 to north of $600,000, we have already sold 114 houses in just over 100 days.  We fully appreciate that to some degree, all buyers are impacted by rising rates and macroeconomic concerns, but buyer groups can absolutely behave differently over the course of a housing cycle. For PulteGroup, we believe being diversified across all buyer groups can enhance both growth and stability.  Beyond our diversification across buyer groups, PulteGroup's strong third quarter financial performance also benefited from our ability to offer consumers both spec built and build-to-order homes. As we have discussed on prior calls over the past 24 months, we have transitioned our first-time buyer communities to a spec build model to better serve these customers. Looking at our first time business, spec building allows us to maintain a more consistent cadence of starts in those communities, which drives construction efficiencies and is important in working with our trades. More directly to our quarter, having additional inventory available was important given 49% of our sales in the period were spec sales. I would note that 49% spec sales in the quarter is down from 58% in Q1 of this year. I think the decrease in the relative percentage of spec sales in the quarter reflects two interesting dynamics. On one hand, the affordability challenges caused by higher interest rates are pushing some buyers, particularly first-time buyers, to the sidelines for now. On the other hand, more affluent buyers who are less fearful about rates are comfortable contracting for a home where they've selected the lot, the floor plan, and the design options.  On the construction side, I'm pleased to say that we continued to shorten our production cycle. Just to remind people, pre-COVID our production cycle was approximately 90 work days. At its worst, this number ballooned to 170 days. By the end of the quarter, we had reduced this number to about 140 days. Our teams continue to shave days and weeks off our build cycle and we remain optimistic about our ability to get back below 100 days in 2024. As you would expect, cutting more than a month off of our cycle time has positively impacted our cash flow, which we continue to allocate across our key business priorities. Through the first nine months of 2023, we have invested $3 billion in our business through land acquisition and development. Over this same period, we have returned over $800 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In this most recent quarter, we even took advantage of market conditions to retire $65 million of near term debt at prices just below par.  PulteGroup has delivered outstanding operating and financial performance in the quarter and throughout the first nine months of the year as we have leveraged our strong competitive position to capitalize on buyer demand. It grows increasingly clear that Federal Reserve actions to raise interest rates are having the desired effect of slowing the economy, although the speed of deceleration has been slower than expected given the unprecedented ramp in rates. While arguably not the most supportive economic backdrop, new home demand in 2023 has benefited from a robust jobs market and rising wages, financially resilient consumers and a continuing dearth of supply from the existing home market, and finally as higher rates begin to bite, we have responded with adjustments in product, pricing and incentive programs that successfully address consumers' biggest pain point, affordability. It's difficult to know if the Fed is done hiking rates for this economic cycle and trying to guess when they will move to cut rates is challenging, so we will remain disciplined in how we manage our business. We'll focus on serving our customers, supporting our employees, turning our assets and allocating capital appropriately while maintaining a strong and highly flexible capital position. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed analysis of our Q3 results. Bob? As you would anticipate, given our 43% increase in net new orders, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter. Q3 displayed more typical seasonality than we have experienced in the three years since COVID as absorption pace eased as we moved through the quarter. Demand has been a little choppier in the first few weeks of October with more volatility in the day-to-day sales numbers.  I'm sure for some buyers, higher rates have pushed affordability just that much further away, while others may be worried about their jobs. For other buyers, global unrest may simply have them thinking of other things. We are fortunate to have an experienced operating team that will make adjustments if and when needed.  On a year-over-year basis, for the first nine months of 2023, we have increased net income by $156 million and increased earnings by share by 17%. Over the same period, we've increased our cash position by approximately $1.6 billion while dropping our net debt to capital ratio effectively to zero. Based on guidance that we've given, we look forward to delivering exceptional full year results for 2023. From population growth and demographics to supply dynamics and the tremendous opportunity for wealth creation through home ownership, we are bullish on long term housing demand. Over the near term, however, we fully appreciate the affordability challenges being created by higher mortgage rates and the potential impacts from an economic slowdown the Federal Reserve is hoping to bring about. As such, we remain disciplined in how we operate our business particularly as it relates to investing in land, the pace of production, the allocation of capital, and the quality of homes and experience we deliver to our customers. We have a clear and successful operating model against which we have been executing for over a decade, so decision making throughout the organization is consistent and actions are implemented quickly. This strong organizational foundation along with tremendous financial strength has PulteGroup well positioned for ongoing success. In closing, I want to thank the entire team at PulteGroup for their tremendous efforts in delivering for our home buyers, our shareholders, and each other. I am so proud of what you accomplish every day. Let me turn the call back to Jim so we can begin Q&A. Yes Carl, so a lot of the work has already been done and what we're seeing is some of the homes that are delivering now, and maybe better said, the homes that are starting now are on cycle times that will yield that overall cycle time of below 100 days, so it's really about getting the older stuff that's been in the pipeline, that's got longer cycle times, that as those numbers close out, I think we'll see our overall cycle times come in line with that target of 100 days. Yes Carl, happy to talk on October. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen sales in October, while good, they've been a little bit choppier than--you know, the day-to-day kind of numbers have been a little choppier. I think the biggest thing that I'd want you to hear is that similar to what we saw in the third quarter, we actually have seen a return to what we would consider seasonal type sign-up trends that we experienced pre-COVID, and we've seen that continue into October. On an absorption rate, the numbers that we're seeing on absorptions per community are pretty similar to what we saw in 2018 and 2019 pre-COVID levels, which were pretty healthy, so all things considered, we feel pretty good about the continued ongoing desire for home ownership. It's not lost on any of you out there listening, rates matter, and there has been a lot of rate movement over the last 30 days, and so I think the consumer, all things considered, has handled that really well. Yes Matt, thanks for the question. We continue to use the permanent 30-year buy-down as probably our most powerful incentive. Right now, we've got national incentives that offer 5.75% on a 30-year fixed, so I think given rates today on the open market would be over 8%, to be able to get a new home in a great location of the quality and design features that we have at 5.75%, I think is pretty powerful. I'll remind everybody, what we've done is we've simply redistributed incentives that we've historically offered toward cabinets and countertops and things of that nature, we've redirected those to interest rate incentives, and I think that's the--you know, that's been the most powerful thing for that buyer group. Yes, well you know, look - inflation is real, and we've previously talked about something in the neighborhood of 8% to 9% year-over-year inflation, which I think is part of the reason we're in the rate environment that we're in as the Fed's trying to get a handle on that. What we've seen on our cost to build is on a year-over-year basis, we're actually flat. Now, that's a lot of commodity and material and labor increase in a number of categories that's been offset by lumber save, so headline is we're flat on a price per square foot to build year-over-year, but it's a lot of increases in material and labor offset by lumber. Yes Mike, I'll take part of that and then I'll have Bob talk about the incentive load. As demonstrated by our orders in the quarter, we had 43% growth in new orders and it was a number of over 7,000, so I think we've clearly demonstrated that we've got the ability to sell homes. You've heard me talk about not being margin proud, but at the same time, we're not going to give away price and incentives that we don't have to, and I think we did exactly that in the third quarter and we'd continue to focus on making sure that we're turning the asset and we're getting the number of absorptions that we need in every single community to deliver the best return on invested capital that we can. Look, I think it was a great quarter. We're happy with how sign-ups performed in October - you know, you heard me kind of talk about that on the question that Carl asked, so I won't repeat it. Then Bob, if you can, maybe just talk a little bit about the incentive load. Yes Mike, our crystal ball at this point, a couple of years out, we're not there yet. We're still kind of focused on Q4. We've given a guide for that quarter, when we get to kind of the end of Q4, we'll certainly give a full year guide for the balance of 2024, but maybe the thing I do want to address is the incentive load that we currently have, that is allowing us to offer incentives on the interest rate, that's been in our margin guide and our results for the entire year.  You're seeing the impact of offering below-market interest rates as an incentive. It's been in Q2 results, it was in our Q3 results and it's in our Q4 guide, so no guidance about what margins direction will be beyond Q4 of this year, but that's all embedded in our--you know, to this point, everything that we've been doing, that's embedded in the results that we've delivered and the guide that we've given. In fact it is, Joe. Yes Joe, thanks for the question, and I'll do my best to give you an answer. For the last decade, maybe even going on 12 years, the way that we've operated the business has been with a singular focus on delivering the best possible return on invested capital that we can. Given the capital intensive nature of this business, for us we think that's the best way to make decisions and to operationalize our platform in a way that delivers high return on assets, high return on equity, whatever metric you want to look at. I think we've clearly done that. I highlighted in my prepared remarks that for the trailing 12 months, we delivered return on equity over 30%, and part of that derived from running a good business but also a very thoughtful and disciplined way in allocating capital, which includes things beyond just buying land and building homes. We are paying a dividend, we've bought back near 45% of the company over the last 10 to 12 years that we've had our share buyback program in place, and we just highlighted this quarter we opportunistically took advantage of the opportunity to buy some debt in, near term debt in that was trading below par. You know, I think maybe the best way I can describe it, Joe, we're going to continue to focus on buying assets in great spots, turning those in a way that delivers high return on invested capital, and one of the other things that I think can also continue to give us flexibility and return-enhancing leverage is moving our land options to 70%, so. We sit at 53% today, we've given you kind of a long term target of 70%. We've got things in place and work underway that will help us get there. Yes, fourth quarter starts will be more reflective of order trends that we're seeing in the fourth quarter. We're starting more spec than we historically have. We've highlighted that we've completely moved our first-time business to a spec business, so some of that's predetermined based on what we saw in the third quarter and what we would anticipate. But we're just not going to get into kind of a position where we've got a build-up of spec inventory that creates pressure to do things that are unnatural on the pricing, but we are going to put some units in the ground to have those ready for Q1. You saw us do that last year, in the back half of last year that set us up for a really strong Q1 of 2023, so. You know, I'd want you to hear balanced approach, inventories going into the ground, we're going to have it ready for Q1, but we are going to be responsive to some of the headwinds that we've acknowledged are out there in this current rate environment. Stephen, the other thing that I'd maybe just add to your conversation is some buyers, you know, they take the available incentives that we have that get them all the way to 5.75%. There are other buyers that decide that they don't need to go all the way to 5.75% and they'd like to have a little bit higher rate and use some of the other incentive money that we're offering for other things that they see value in. We're seeing about 80% to 85% of our buyers are getting some form of incentive towards interest rates. That doesn't mean everybody will go to 5.75%. Just some fraction of our total sales end up in that very lowest category.  The big headline is that we've got the tools out there and our sales team has got the tools out there to help individually solve what each and every buyer needs to make the transaction work for them. Yes Stephen, we are at a very--we're at a lower leverage rate than what we've historically run at. I think that really more than anything, it's a testament to the strength of the business. We've been operating really well and we have been generating a lot of cash. We've really been touching kind of all the critical parts of our capital allocation philosophy. We've invested a lot of money into land and land development, we've been paying our dividend, we've bought back the highest single quarter spend in shares this year in the third quarter at $300 million, and we bought back some debt, and with that, we still grew the cash balance, so I think it really demonstrates how strong the business is operating. In terms of your question on pricing and discounts and elasticity or inelasticity, we're going to continue to price and set incentives at a level that we think is appropriate for the market. We're going to be responsive, we're not going to be margin proud. At the same time, I think we've got a good understanding of what value is, and you shouldn't expect to see kind of the national year-end blowout, red tag kind of screaming baby sale from us - I don't think that helps the consumer. But I think you're seeing us put the appropriate incentive load such that we're turning the asset, we're turning the inventory, we're making sure that we're getting a minimum of two sales per active community, which is kind of the level that I think you need to be at in production homebuilding to deliver the types of return on assets, return on inventory, return on invested capital that we want. Morning Ken. Ken, it's Ryan, I'll jump in on that. We haven't sliced the bologna quite that thin, and I won't attempt to do it on this call. We are a return-focused company. There is no change there. I think we've been the purveyors of the message, we don't focus on margin, it's a component of the overall operating model. We're focused on return, and depending on the number of units we sell in a particular community and how quickly you turn the asset, if you do that fast enough, then it can offset and you can allow for lower gross margins. If you're getting a lot just in time and somebody else is developing it and carrying it, and we can build in the hundred days that we're talking about, it allows us to run a high returning business at a lower margin. That's not a new concept, that's exactly what we do, and it's exactly what we'll continue to do. Yes John, we were--I think the lowest we were was 5%, 5.25% at a national level. We had some specific markets that may have been sub-5% at 4.99%, but basically as you've seen the headline rate move from 7.5% to 8%, you've seen our promotional rate move up by that same 50 basis points. I think generally, that's a good rule of thumb. I mean, there is--I think practically speaking, there's a limit to how much money you can throw at the rate relative to what the headline number is. And then we haven't given anything for '24 yet, John, but as we've said in the past, you can see the capital that we've spent, for the land that we've spent this year, a pretty good indicator of what community count will be in the future, or you can use as a proxy for what community count can turn into in the future. Yes, so I don't want to give away all of our trade secrets on that, but suffice it to say there are different rules based on who is--depending on which government agency rules you're using for that mortgage program. For the upfront fees that we're paying on a forward commitment, because those are done prior to having a home under contract, those fees do not count toward seller contribution; but there are additional incentives that have to be applied to the deal--that do have to be applied to the deal once the home's under contract, those do certainly count towards the seller contribution, so to get to 5.75%, you've got some fees on the front end, you've got some fees on the back end. We do look at them in the aggregate, and those are the numbers that you're hearing Bob talk about. No, we haven't run that analysis, no. I would highlight that no matter the rate that we're offering, we qualify the buyer on the 30-year, so a lot of the incentives that we've been doing have been 30-year fixed rate, so that is the rate we're qualifying, but in the case that you do a temporary buy-down, the buyer is qualified at what the permanent 30-year rate will be. I think everybody knows that, but I think it's worth highlighting because we don't--none of us wants to see the industry back in a situation that we were in, in 2008. Yes Alan, I think we're hearing the same things that you are, particularly on maybe availability of capital or the cost of capital on the land development side. There's definitely, I think, some strain or tightness in that arena. I think that certainly might continue to create an opportunity the longer that we stay in a high rate environment.  I think it's also a great opportunity for us to take market share. With our mortgage company, the size of our balance sheet, the ability to be active in the capital markets, I think it gives us an opportunity to do things that smaller local builders and maybe private builders can't, so I think there is certainly a market share opportunity there as well. We've made build-to-rent a small piece of our business. We've got good relationships with national partners that we're building some percentage of our annual deliveries for those operators, and I think we've talked extensively about that, that it will continue to be an arrow in our operational quiver.  Look - I'm really, really confident and pleased with the way we're operating. The health of the business, the volume that we're selling in kind of the core operations, and then when you go to the balance sheet, I think we're set up to do a lot of great things that will continue to set us up for success down the road. Yes Alan, it's a good question. The thing that I talk about with our operators, and I spend a lot of time in the field in our communities, in our division offices talking about exactly this, the mantra that we have inside the company is a minimum of two sales in every community. Now, certainly we have certain price points in communities that sell way more than two per community, but as a production homebuilder, it's hard to have an active store that does less than two, you just--you know, you can't make the returns work to the level of our expectations.  Below two per active community, that's where we start looking at, hey, we are positioned right, do we have the right incentives, do we have the right pricing, do we have the right product, are we going after the right consumer? There's a number of those levers that we pull, but it nets out to for this quarter, we were 2.5, but that two per community is kind of the level that we look at. We're going to the way-back machine, Truman. Yes Truman, look, I think we're really pleased with what our first-time business is doing. We've invested in it, and we've said our target was to get it to kind of 40% of our business, and we've done that. I think you've seen not only growth in absorptions but growth in communities, and the business is about where we'd like it to be. On one hand, that buyer doesn't have a home to sell, they're not locked into a low interest rate that they're reluctant to get rid of, so I think that's the positive with that first-time buyer. In terms of the headwinds, I think it's obvious - it's 8% interest rates, and that's a buyer that's got a down payment, hopefully, either they've saved it or it's been gifted to them by parents, and then they're going and getting a 30-year mortgage and they're working on what they can afford based on their wages. The good news is wages are going up, which is helping affordability, but beyond rate-rate-rate, there's probably not a bunch more that I could add in terms of the first-time buyer. Maybe just the last thing on the overall rate environment, look, high rates aren't good for the consumer, they're not good for housing, they're not good for the broader economy, but we're all kind of playing in the same environment and with the quality of the management team that we have and the way that we're operating this company, I think we've proven that we've got the tools and the operational flexibility to be successful in any environment. This most recent quarter is a great example of that. Yes, so in terms of product, Truman, the one great thing about our product portfolio is we offer a lot of flexibility to scale up, scale down. We offer structural options that allow a smaller floor plan with added square footage in the form of loft or additional flex space. We've got the ability to take a base floor plan, scale it up or scale it down, and we're seeing buyers use that flexibility to help address some of the affordability challenges that are out there. In our--the way that we sell options, we see buyers pick the things that they see value in, and we're also seeing buyers make trade-offs in terms of how they spend those dollars, in terms of cabinets, countertops, upgrades, etc.  The last piece of your question, Truman, remind me again? Yes, roughly. I think that's a good go-forward run rate. It's higher than what we experienced pre-COVID - that's mostly reflective of the size of our first-time business and entirely moving that to spec. We did highlight this quarter, 49% - that's down from about 60% earlier in the year, so we feel pretty good about that performance in the spec business."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Incorporated, Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And I will now turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nJim Zeumer: Good morning. And thank you for joining today\u2019s call, to discuss PulteGroup\u2019s exceptional second quarter operating and financial results. Along with affirming the ongoing desire for home ownership and the strength of overall buyer demand, our second quarter numbers demonstrate the strategic value of PulteGroup's balanced and disciplined approach to the business.  Joining me on today's call to discuss our Q2 results, are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Pablo Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior VP of Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to inform everyone on today's call that today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports.  Let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan? \nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim. Good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, Q2 was an outstanding quarter for PulteGroup, as we posted strong financial results throughout our P&L, balance sheet and cash flow statement. In fact, our second quarter revenues, gross and operating margins and net income were at or are approaching all-time highs for our second quarter.  Our record financial performance in turn drove strong cash flows that helped to raise our cash position to $1.8 billion, while dropping our net debt to capital ratio to almost zero.  I am really proud of our homebuilding and financial services teams, for delivering these great results which are even more impressive given the variable market conditions we've operated in for the past 12 months. Within these complicated market dynamics, I believe PulteGroup's operating and financial success reflects the balanced and disciplined approach we take in running our homebuilding business.  We continue to successfully implement both a build-to-order model that serves our move-up and active adult buyers. In combination with a spec based model primarily within our first-time buyer communities. Our spec production is most heavily weighted toward our Centex branded communities, which operate under a managed spec production model. In other words, homes are started spec, that we have aligned to starts cadence with our sales pace. Given Centex is focused on serving the needs of first-time buyers, our long-term plan is to maintain a spec build model in these communities.  By being more balanced across build-to-order and spec production, we maintain a more consistent cadence of home starts, meet buyer demand more effectively, and we achieve the critical objective of turning our assets in support of higher returns. You can see the practical application of this managed approach in our Q2 numbers, as specs total 36% of units under production at quarter end. Of these units, we averaged just over one finish spec per community, which is in line with our stated goal.  Along with being balanced between our build-to-order and spec production, we were appropriately diversified across all the buyer groups consistent with our long-term goal of having 40% first time 35% move-up and 25% active adult.  Why is this important? The different financial profiles associated with each buyer group can mean different responses to changing market dynamics, such as today's rising rate environment, which may hinder first time buyers, but be less of a headwind among active adult consumers. Being balanced across build-to-order, spec and buyer groups is also an important underpinning to the extremely high gross margins we've been able to maintain. More directly, we have enough production to meet buyer demand, but not so much that we are no longer selling from a position of strength.  I think we've achieved the right mix as we increased orders and closings, all while two-thirds of our divisions are still able to raise prices in the quarter. Along these same lines, we continue to see pricing opportunities within our core build-to-order business that primarily serves our move up and active adult buyers. In our most recent quarter options in law premiums exceeded $100,000 per home. These are high margin dollars that are not as prevalent among first time buyers and certainly were an important driver of the strong 29.6% gross margin we reported in Q2.  When the market started slowing in 2022, I said that we couldn't be margin proud, but rather we had to find price and turn our assets, delivering 24% growth in Q2 orders. And as Bob will detail guiding the margins of 29% or better for the remainder of the year, we are achieving both high margins and high asset turns, which drove our 32% return on equity.  Beyond the company's specific benefits, we're realizing from how we run our business, we appreciate the favorable supply and demand dynamics resulting from the limited stock of existing houses available for sale. National Association of Realtors data for June showed seasonally adjusted existing home sales of 4.2 million, which is down a staggering 1 million homes from June of last year.  As has been well reported, there are millions of existing homeowners who are sitting on low rate mortgages established before the most recent cycle of Fed rate hikes. I recently saw an FHA graph that showed that more than 50% of current mortgage holders have a rate below 4%. I haven't seen any rate forecasts that show the country getting back to 4% mortgages anytime soon.  So it's likely that existing homes remain in short supply for the foreseeable future. FHA data, along with mortgage rate forecasts suggests that there may be an extended period during which mortgage rates stay above 5%, which likely prevents an oversupply of existing homes being released into the market.  Through the first six months of 2023, we generated $1.3 billion of net income and $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations. As a result, we increased our cash position by almost $700 million, while returning almost $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I think these numbers clearly demonstrate the powerful results our company is delivering. With a backlog of $8.2 billion worth of homes to be built, improving cycle times and a solid land supply, we are well positioned to deliver even stronger performance over the remainder of 2023.  Now let me turn the call over to Bob, for a detailed review of the quarter, Bob?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Our second quarter numbers speak for themselves in terms of demonstrating the strength of our operations, and in turn overall housing demand, so I'll just dive right in.  Our second quarter wholesale revenues totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% over last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 5% increase in closings to 7,518 homes, in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $540,000. Our ability to meet stronger demand in the period with available spec inventory allowed us to slightly exceed our prior closing guidance.  For the quarter our mix of closings was comprised of 41% first time buyers, 34% move-up buyers and 25% active adult buyers. The breakdown of our business remains in line with our stated targets of 40% first time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult. In the second quarter of last year, our closing mix was 36% first time, 38% move-up and 26% active adult.  Our net new orders in the second quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,947 homes. The double-digit increase in our orders benefited from the overall strength of market demand in the period along with our ability to capture this demand through a 14% increase in our average community count to 903 neighborhoods.  The strength of consumer demand is also evident in our cancellation rate. Cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog was 9% in this quarter, which is down almost 350 basis points on a sequential basis from the first quarter.  The 24% increase in our second quarter net new orders reflects an increase in our absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month, up from 2.7 homes per month last year and resulted in higher net new orders across all buyer groups. In the period net new orders from first time buyers increased 28% over the prior year to 3,150 home. Orders for move-up buyers increased 33% to 2,897 homes and orders from active adult buyers increased 7% to 1900 homes.  The year-over-year increase in first time buyer orders shows that our homes continue to offer a compelling value and meet the affordability requirements of this buyer group. At the same time, our higher net new orders in move-up and active adult buyers is a positive development and test to the broad mix strength of housing demand.  Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% in the third and fourth quarters, each month compared to the comparable prior year period. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13,588 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. In the second quarter of last year, our backlog stood at 19,176 homes, valued at a record peak of $11.6 billion.  We ended the second quarter with a total of 16,740 homes under construction, of which approximately 6000 or 36% were spec. We continue to closely manage spec production as total specs under construction at quarter end were down 11% from last year. Finished specs are also consistent with our historical carry rate as we ended the quarter with about one finished spec per community.  In the second quarter, we started approximately 7,400 homes, which is up 41% compared to the first quarter of this year. Given the strength of PulteGroup's year intake orders and deliveries coupled with the status of our backlog and production universe, we're establishing a full year 2023 delivery target of 29,500 homes. Of this total we would expect to deliver between 7000 and 7,400 homes in the third quarter.  Our third quarter and full year delivery targets are benefiting from improved home construction cycle times, as our operations are realizing meaningful improvements in cycle times of homes they are starting today. Based on the mix of backlog homes we expect to deliver in the third and fourth quarters coupled with anticipated spec closings we are projecting in those periods, we expect the average sales price on third and fourth quarter closing to be approximately $540,000.  Turning to margins, our reported gross margin in the second quarter was 29.6%. The improvement in our margins as compared to our previous guide was due to improve pricing on spec sales and increased closings from our higher margin markets, features compared to our prior estimates. In addition, as we discussed in our prior earnings call, our aggregate gross margins are benefiting from our move-up and active adult business, where profitability is holding up better.  Based on current market dynamics, we expect to maintain the strong margin position throughout the remainder of '23. And expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.0% to 29.5%, in both the third and fourth quarter of this year. As we experienced for the second quarter the actual mix of deliveries, both in terms of geography and buyer groups may impact our reported numbers.  Our reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $315 million, or 7.8% of home sale revenues, and included a $65 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In the second quarter of last year, our SG&A expense was $351 million, or 9.3% of home sale revenues. Based on our delivery targets for the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5% of home sale revenues in the third quarter in the range of 8% to 8.5% of home sale revenues in the fourth quarter.  Second quarter pretax income generated by our financial services operations increased 16% over last year to $46 million. Pricing conditions remain highly competitive in the mortgage industry, but quarterly earnings benefited from improved profitability within our title and insurance operations. Capture rate in the second quarter improved to 80% compared with 78% last year.  Our reported tax expense in the second quarter was $233 million for an effective tax rate of 24.4%. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of '23 to be 24.5%. On the bottom line, our reported second quarter net income was a record $740 million or $3.21 per share. This was up from last year's reported net income of $652 million or $2.73 per share. Capitalizing on our outstanding financial results and resulting cash flows, we\u2019ve repurchased 3.7 million common shares in the quarter at a cost of $250 million, at an average price of $68.31 per share. Through the first six months of '23, we have used $400 million to repurchase 6.4 million shares or 2.8% of our common shares outstanding. We also invested $370 million in land acquisition and $523 million in related development during the quarter. In total, our land sale in the period was $893 million, which is down from $1.1 billion through the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, this year, we have invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition development, which keeps us on track to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion for the full year. At the end of the second quarter, we had 214,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The total number of lots we control and the percentage of lots we controlled via option both increased from Q1 of this year as we are working to rebuild our option lot supply after exiting positions in the back half of 2022.  We also ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 17.3%. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio is now below 3%. Looking briefly at our full year results, on a year-to-date basis, we have generated net income of $1.3 billion, drove the book value of our stock by 12% and returned $472 million to shareholders. At the same time, our financial performance has permitted us to reduce our financial leverage to historic lows, and we have generated a return on equity for the trailing 12 months of 32%. Thank you, and I'll turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. As we've commented, homebuyer demand in the second quarter was strong and continued to exceed the expectation we had coming into the year. In the overwhelming majority of our markets, local pricing dynamics are stable to positive, and we continue to find opportunities to modestly increase net pricing in many of our communities. Further, at an absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month for the period, sales pace for the second quarter was above last year and generally above our pre-COVID averages. Demand in the second quarter was fairly consistent from month to month. And as you would anticipate, with a 24% increase in orders, we generally saw positive demand across our markets, which has continued into the month of July. That being said, on a relative basis, there are communities in our Western markets where we are still having to adjust pricing and/or incentives to entice buyers into our communities and ensure we continue to turn our assets. Given the higher interest rate environment, one of the changes we have seen is the slight increase in the number of cash buyers, particularly among our active adult customers. As this buyer group moves into our plans for retirement, they are making the decision to carry less mortgage debt given today's higher rates.  At the other end of the price spectrum, final purchase decisions among first-time buyers are also being impacted by higher rates. As data suggests, some first-time buyers are opting to go with less square footage or fewer options and upgrades as buyers need to purchase a home in today's dynamic market environment is why our ability to offer a significant mortgage incentive nationally is such an effective sales tool. With that said, our first-time buyers remain financially resilient as personal savings remain the primary source of down payment. At the same time, we continue to see millennials are getting self-support from parents if they need help making the move into homeownership. One final note as to buyer sentiment, recent feedback from our first-time buyers indicate that an overwhelming majority bought a new construction Pulte home rather than an existing home because they felt it offered the best overall value. We've been extremely thoughtful about the home designs we are putting on the ground and the incentives we are offering to help ensure we are offering a compelling value to our customers. These comments in combination with our 28% increase in second quarter orders within the first-time buyer group indicate our efforts are meeting with success.  In closing, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their efforts in delivering such outstanding operating and financial results. Beyond the numbers we show in our financial statements, and continue to provide exceptional homes and home buying experiences to our customers. I will now turn the call back to Jim.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the time remaining. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And I'll now ask Abby to explain the process and open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is the 29% to 29.5% gross margins that you're expecting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter are clearly well above what we were forecasting. Just curious, are there any unusual items in there that we should think about? It sounds like mix is going to be a benefit. And what I'm really trying to get at is, what do you view as sort of the sustainable rate of margin? Is -- are we there? Is this sustainable? And if not, how quickly would you expect a reversion towards that more normalized rate?\nRyan Marshall: John, good morning. It's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how all of our consumer groups have been performing and certainly, how we saw the strength of sign-ups by consumer group in the most recent quarter. The mix of business, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen from us over the past 12 months. And as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks, it's totally in line with kind of our stated goals. So really nothing there that I would highlight of note. And then in terms of kind of the forward kind of margin profile, we've given both a guide for Q3 and Q4, which I think what you want to read into that is that's where we see the business for the balance of the year, we're clearly not giving anything kind of beyond that at this point.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one more question on margin. I think last quarter, you guys talked about the spread between active adult, move-up an entry level sort of reverting back to historical norms and I think that was a quick move-in portion kind of going back a little bit on the lower end. Given where housing demand is today and the desire for many folks to move in quickly, are you expecting that sort of quick move-in portion to actually trend higher again?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, John, we've actually seen that be pretty stable in terms of the number of orders that are coming from our spec production, which is part of the reason we spent quite a bit of time talking about that today. We like the investment community to understand that the way we're running our production machine is very specific and intentional by buyer group.  Specifically, to your point with the first-time buyer group, that business is predominantly a spec business for us. The margins are lower to your point, which is a reversion to what we saw in pre-COVID kind of times that our first-time business was our lowest margin. We typically get a couple of hundred basis points higher out of our move-up and family business. And then our highest margin will come out of our active adult communities.  We're definitely seeing that today. That's the other point that I would really highlight for you in kind of the guide that we've given for margins for the balance of the year. A big part of our business or a big chunk of our business is from our first time entry-level business, which is all incorporated into that guide.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. I guess, first question, just kind of asking the gross margins from a different perspective, and then I have a question on demand. When you think about the more challenged backdrop that the industry faced in the back half of '22, for builders that were more spec oriented, you saw the more immediate impact of that higher promotional, not promotional, but incentives and pricing adjustments that many builders made. You saw that run through the income statement much more immediately. We were estimating for build-to-order builders that, that would have a more of a lag effect. So, can you kind of walk through the dynamics of how you've been able to maintain since the fourth quarter? You had some pullback from 2Q '22, but nothing to the extent of the more spec-oriented, perhaps first-time heavy builders. Perhaps the product mix is a factor, but how that higher promotional environment has impacted the financials and if there's offsets to that, that have allowed a much more modest decline as well as for a build-to-order builder, a pretty nice element of stability going into the back half. So sorry for the long-winded, but just trying to understand perhaps what are the offsets to the higher incentive backdrop in the back half and the pluses and minuses there?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike. I'll let Bob maybe give you a little more detail on kind of the discounts in the quarter, which we actually -- we've seen kind of come down just a tab sequentially. So, in terms of the discounts, we are effectively using our discount money toward mortgage rate buydowns. It's particularly affected with that first-time buyer.  I think the reports and some of the data that's out there on mortgage rate environment, which suggests the sweet spot for most buyers is somewhere around 5.5%. So for us, it's really been to reallocating incentive dollars away from things that buyers may have previously used those incentives toward we're finding a lot of those incentives are being used in the mortgage rate environment.\nMichael Rehaut: And if, Bob, you can kind of weigh in on any of the pluses and minuses there, it would seem that to the extent that you had any impact from the higher discounting or price adjustment, it would be in the back half of full year guide. And so just making sure there's no other \u201cshoe to drop here\u201d or we've kind of worked through some of the more challenging backdrop there. I guess yes...\nPablo Shaughnessy: Sorry, yes, there's no shoe, right? We have provided a guide. And so if you're focused on sales activity from the back half of '22, it has either closed or somewhat limited circumstances will close over the next three to six months. So it's in our P&L already or reflected in the guide that we have given. The relativity of our markets to the space, if you think about it, our margins didn't go up quite as much in '21 and into the beginning half of '22. And part of the reason for that was we didn't have as much spec production as others did.  And so they were pricing product at the time it was completed, getting full value for it whereas we were contracting often times three and six and nine months ahead of time. And so some of the price appreciation that went on in the market during the time we were constructing the home, we didn't feel the full benefit of that in our margin profile then. And so you saw kind of the really spec-heavy builders capturing every dollar of value. Now against the next -- if you think about the back half of '23-- sorry, of '22 and into '23, they were once again pricing at market. They had the full cost of a heavy lumber load, honestly, and an inflationary environment influencing their cost structure and prices weren't running quite as quickly, particularly in that entry level. So I think their reversion reflected the underwriting of land that they bought and the timing of their construction. Ours, again, for that spec business, we are fully engaged now on that. Again, that is -- you're seeing that in our margins today. It's always worth it to highlight we typically play at a little bit higher price point in that entry-level business, a little bit closer in. And so it's not quite apples-to-apples with some of our competitive set. So I don't want to sound defensive, but there's nothing really unique in this quarter's margin or we would have called it out. There's nothing unique that's coming in the next couple of quarters and the margin is going to stay pretty strong.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, guys. Ryan, you mentioned that two-thirds of your divisions had raised prices over the course of the quarter. Could you expand on that a little bit? Does that mean net average order prices were up? And then can you talk about how that mix and price change was that reduction in incentives, increasing base prices, options upgrades, lot premium? Just want to get a little more color on the price increase activity you're actually putting into the mix right now.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Carl. Two things there. We did see price increases in some of our communities in two-thirds of the division. So it wasn't every division, it wasn't every single community. But we are seeing pockets of strength where we're able to, to your question, I'll answer the affirmative, it is a net increase in net pricing and it's coming through all of the options that you listed. So there are modest increases. And those are -- I would note that those are off of what we would consider adjusted kind of current cycle floor pricing. So we feel like we've seen a bit of strengthening in the overall sales environment, which allowed us to modestly increase pricing.\nCarl Reichardt: Okay, thank you, Ryan. And then to drill down on the first-time buyer Centex spec business, what kind of backlog conversion rate do you sort of target in that business specifically? And then can you mention maybe a little bit more color on cycle time improvement, where you have been, where you are now and where you think you can go with sort of normalized supply chain over the course of the next couple of three quarters? Thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Carl. I don't have a specific number for you on backlog conversion of that specific buyer group. We could follow up with you offline on that. The things that we're really monitoring there, we're running a -- with that spec business, specifically, we're running a predictable and consistent monthly with start rate. And we've worked to match that start rate to what we believe our monthly sales rate has been, is and will be. And so it's part of what you heard me talk about in my prepared remarks around getting our start rate matched to the sales rate, which we think we've effectively done. And then the second question cycle times, Carl, yes, we're starting to see those come down very much in line with our anticipated improvements throughout the year. It's not been easy, it's been a lot of hard work by our procurement teams, our construction managers and certainly our trade partners that have helped us to reduce those cycle times. So we're seeing at least a couple of weeks come out of the cycle times and certainly starts that are going in the ground today. We'd expect to maybe even get a little bit more by the time that those deliver. That's been a big contributor to our success, not only in Q2, but to the updated and increased guide for full year closings that we've provided today.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Great job. Beats go on. Nice to see. I guess I had a question about, just to touch on the volume side of the story. Can you give us a sense for what kind of rate of growth in community count, the current level of land spend that you're allocating here? What kind of growth in community count can that support? It's a general question, looking out not specific to 3Q necessarily. And can you also regarding volume. Can you give us a sense for what the absorption rates? What the dispersion looks like across your three major segments?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen. I'm reluctant to answer your first question because we haven't provided any view beyond the third and fourth quarters. And so I'm going to pass on that. And then in terms of the absorption paces, we haven't provided that level of detail. What I can tell you is that in the current operating environment, the quickest-growing part of the business is move-up right now, interestingly enough. So absorptions there grew faster. We had absorption growth across all three demographics. And so we had highlighted 28% growth in the first time, 33% in the move-up and 7% in the active adult. But on a per store basis, all of them were up. The richest contributor to that actually was the move-up space.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess I'll just go back to the gross margin side. Maybe just to put a finer point on it. I think I heard you say that the, I guess, mix of sort of incentivized build-to-order product from end of '22 sales has largely worked through at this point. So what exactly would be, I guess, a worse headwind in the gross margin in the third quarter relative to the second quarter? Is it entirely mix of entry level -- or excuse me, first-time buyer spec? Or what exactly is the greater headwind to cause that sequential step down in margins? Thank you.\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes, it's a couple of things. One, we are an inflationary environment. Our land is more expensive, labor is more expensive, materials more expensive. You can see lumbers trending up given the faster cycle some of that is going to come into our production in the back half of the year. And then certainly, the mix on a geographic basis matters. And so we'll see some contributions from some margin communities that we've had to adjust as we've gone through the year. It's normal. So I know it's a non-answer, but mix always matters in that conversation.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that Bob. And then, I guess, secondly, just back on that last point around the improvement in move-up, obviously, looking at the second quarter of last year, I mean, the comp is a little bit easier, but clearly, a nice step-up there. Any finer detail? I mean you gave a lot of color at the top around just what's kind of locking in existing home sellers at this point, but you are seeing this nice tick up in your move-up business. So kind of what do you think is sort of driving that? And do you expect it to continue relative to entry level? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Matthew, I think that's the biggest driver is there's just such a shortage of supply and fewer options for that move-up buyer to choose from. So as a percentage of the available choices that are out there, new homes have become a much bigger piece of that. And I think you're seeing our move-up business benefit from that. I would share that we've got great communities, we've got excellent designs. The quality of the homes that we're building, I think, are really speaking to that move-up buyer that's looking to add more space or get a newer, more energy-efficient, more technological advanced homes.  So I think those things are working to our advantage as well. And in this higher interest rate environment, our ability to offer our national mortgage rate incentive program to the move-up buyer is meaningful as well. That's a tool that we're able to effectively leverage that the resale market is not at the same degree. So I think a number of factors there with the headline being there's just less inventory out there.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Bob. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nAlan Ratner: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I'd love to drill in a little bit on the topic from Steve's question about land spend. If you look at your closing guide, it's gone up about 20% for this year since the start of the year. And your land spend guide hasn't really changed, still kind of in that $3.5 billion to $4 billion range. And I know that's a big range, so maybe the answer is you're coming in closer to the high end versus the low end. But I'm just curious, as you think about the next few years, I mean, $3.5 billion to $4 billion, probably is pretty close to a replacement level of land, maybe a bit below, but as you think about the land market today and what you're seeing there, is that an area where you feel like at some point, you're going to have to put pedal to the metal and get more aggressive on land spend to drive future growth? And I guess, alternatively, is there a risk of a similar dynamic unfolding from a few years ago, where if demand stays at these levels and you don't see the opportunities in the land market, do you start to limit sales again and do things to kind of keep a lid on that to prevent gap-outs?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, thanks for the questions. Ryan. A couple of things. Maybe I'd start with there. For starters, we actually did increase our projected land spend number about a quarter ago. So when we went into the year, I think we were right around $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. We've moved that up with the high end and as high as $4 billion, certainly down from last year, and that was intentional.  When we look at our controlled lot supply, we've got 215,000 lots, plus or minus, under control. Over half of those are controlled via options. So we feel pretty good about kind of what's in the pipeline and what that will mean for the business. Market share and growth are certainly part of our story and part of the things that we're trying to do with our strategy.  To your question, Alan, around what are we seeing in the land market, I'd tell you that we're able to get deals done. It is a competitive market, and there certainly isn't anything that's being liquidated or fire sold, but we are to -- our land teams are doing a nice job finding good opportunities, and we've stayed consistent with our disciplined underwriting process, which has yielded the types of results and quarters that we've delivered over the last several years. So our plan is to stick with that to continue, to stay very balanced and disciplined and running a good business and being really laser focused on picking our spots with where we're investing more capital.  So to this point, I don't think we need to do anything along the lines of put the pedal to the metal. I think we're going to continue to be foot on the gas, but we're going to continue to focus on monetizing the 214,000 lots that we have, which we'll see what the market holds, but I think that will give us an opportunity to continue to run a very nice business that will grow in the market.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. I really appreciate that. That's helpful. Second, I do have a question about Florida. You guys are pretty as large in Florida, and there's been a lot written of late about the issues with property insurance in the state and some pretty staggering increases there. And I know some of that can be certainly sensationalized. But I'm curious, A, are you seeing that become more of a concern among homeowners or potential home buyers today in the state? And B, are you aware of anything that the industry might be doing to kind of deal with this issue, because it seems like it could have some long-term ramifications?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan. We haven't seen it become a problem for buyers to make the decision to move into our Florida communities. And in fact, our Florida business has been one of our strongest best-performing regions. And we've got a very diversified business in Florida that ranges from entry level to a heavy move-up business in Tampa and Orlando. And then when you get into South Florida, our active adult consumer and second home buyers are very prevalent. We've got great businesses there. Part of our financial services operation, we have an insurance company. We aggregate and we talk about the numbers and the business that they generate as part of our overall financial service portfolio. But we find that our captive insurance agency does a nice job helping to solve some of those problems.  Florida is one of those places, Alan, and I think over the years. There's been an ebb and flow of insurers that are in the market, they leave, they come back, having lived in Florida personally for a long time. I saw that happened over the last 15 years with my own insurance companies, but they wouldn't renew, they'd leave for a few years and then inevitably, they come back and they want the business again. So we'll keep an eye on it. California is the other state that there's been a lot in the news media recently about a lot of insurance companies that have left the state due to large losses. So certainly, things that we want to keep an eye on. I would highlight that there are -- there is a view that new homes performed better. They're in -- from a flood standpoint, they're up to spec out of the flood plain, higher than homes that have been developed in recent past. The drainage systems are more prevalent. They're built to current code. You've got new electrical, they're more energy efficient. So there's an argument to say there's potentially less risk with newer constructed homes.\nAlan Ratner: Thanks for the time. Appreciated. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One more follow-up on the land side. Ryan, you mentioned you're not necessarily seeing like liquidation opportunities. The market is competitive. There were some thoughts or hopes that some of the regional banking fallout might shake some land to lose. Maybe you can comment on that.  But then also in terms of classes that your land teams are having, given the competition out there, has it been more that you're getting to your underwriting box because your current pace and price has improved? Or has it been a buyer as have also adjusted downward? I'm sure there's some blend, but kind of on average, what do you think is helping more at this point? Is it that buyers-- that sellers have actually adjusted? Or is it more that at current pace and price, more things hit the box?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. As always, as Ryan said, land is not on sale. We have not seen opportunities on large-scale things for banks or private market transactions of any substance. And in terms of the current activity levels, I think it's a combination of both and it probably depends on where you are in the country.  There are parts of the country where we have seen some willingness to negotiate on land because the market is a little stickier than it was 18 or 24 months ago. But by and large, no, the market is pretty firm. And we are -- we have not changed our underwriting screen at all. Based on activity levels that we see and can project, we're able to make them underwrite, but they're not on sale.\nMichael Dahl: Okay. That makes sense, Bob. And then just as a follow-up, maybe I'll broaden that out. Slightly when we think about some of these dynamics, could you just touch on more specifically your sticks and bricks cost, both in the quarter? How we should be thinking about that in the second half? I know you alluded to lumber -- some lumber increases maybe creeping in, but maybe any more quantification of sticks and bricks? And then on the lot side, how should we be thinking about inflationary dynamics in your way at cost here over the next, say, four quarters?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. I think on the land side, and we always answer it this way, we don't have any ramp up or ramp down in our land portfolio. And so the normal inflationary aspect we see comes if we buy land in three-year increments. We develop it. We then build on it and cost it off. And so we've seen a pretty steady increase. I wouldn't want to put a particular percentage on it because it varies on when we are in the -- if you think over the last five years, the way pricing has moved. On the vertical side and even on the horizontal development side to get outside of the acquisition side of the dirt, we came into the year projecting, call it, 12% to 14% increase in costs. We've been able to dial that down. We highlighted on the last call, we were 8% to 9%. We're still there. So our total house cost is up about that year-over-year, and that's going to be inclusive of lumber save earlier in the year. It started to pick back up, materials and labor is the real driver of that. We've been able to work with our trades to try and find efficiencies. Ryan talked about it.  We want to be a production consistent cadence of starts, consistency in the production cycle that makes it easier for the trades. And now that the supply chain is healthier, we've been able to reduce some of the cost increases through efficiency, not on the purchasing side for materials because, again, that inflationary aspect is there. And when you kind of wash all that together, we're seeing costs up, like I said, 8% to 9%.\nMichael Dahl: Very helpful. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTruman Patterson : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, you all generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash flow in the first half of the year. Clearly, you've been rebuilding your spec pipeline, you're kind of cutting back on some land investment, but you should still generate some pretty healthy net income in the back half of the year. I'm just really hoping you can run us through some of the pluses and minuses on your full year '23 operating cash flow potential.\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. We haven't given guide on that Tru, but you're exactly right. I mean, if you think about it, we generated $1.5 billion through the first six months of the year. And if you put, I think, the closing volumes and the cost estimates for margins and for SG&A, the operating margin on that forward business at a sales price of $540 million is pretty rich. And certainly, inventory levels will change. But we think actually that we have an opportunity to reduce our investment in-house over the balance of the year because of the improvement in cycle times. So to your point, we're going to generate a bunch of cash in the back half of the year.\nTruman Patterson: Fair enough. Fair enough. And then just wanted to follow up on a prior question. Given the healthy demand rebound so far, it looks like your absorption levels are at pretty healthy levels, a little bit above what we'll just call kind of historical 2Q averages over the past decade, if you will. Could you just run through whether there were any geographies or consumer segment where you're actually perhaps curbing absorptions again as of the second quarter?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Truman, we're -- look, we're always balancing our production machine with the amount of developed land that we have in front of us as well as what our trade capacity is. But other than a unique community here or there that is way oversubscribed, we're not in the type of allocation restriction mode that we saw maybe during COVID.\nTruman Patterson: Right. Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : This is Ashu Soni [ph] on for Anthony. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask relative to sort of the sequential price growth on ASP in net orders you saw in the quarter. Was that pretty much like-for-like? Or maybe there might have been some mix impact? And then sort of more broadly, would you say pricing power has gotten stronger at all versus where you were seeing it on your last call in April?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. I think we highlighted that some of that in our prepared remarks, and there was a question earlier, we have in certain geographies and certain communities have been able to modestly increase prices from what was arguably a pricing floor after we made adjustments late last year. So part of that is related to an effective use of the mortgage incentive, which we've used to help solve some affordability challenges. But part of that is there's a real shortage of inventory and the market is allowing us to make some modest price increases. So all of that's kind of reflected in the results that we had for Q2 as well as the guide that we've given for the balance of this year.\nUnidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then what are your thoughts on kind of the sustainability of progress you've made on cycle times and costs kind of heading into '24 as housing activity is heating back up. Are you -- do you anticipate maybe pressure on cycle times?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. We actually believe that we still got opportunity to continue to do more. And Bob highlighted it in the question that he just answered a minute ago for Truman. As it relates to cash, as we feel that we've got opportunity to continue to reduce cycle time, not only in the balance of this year, but well into '24. It's predominantly coming from a healing of the supply chain and removing a lot of the inefficiencies that crept in, given -- but we had a broken supply chain and trades were incredibly inefficient. So we're making progress. We're pleased with it, but we're probably nowhere near where we'd like to be. Our target still remains getting back to pre-COVID cycle times, which is where I think the company can operate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it over. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSusan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is thinking a bit about the supply chain and the rise that we're seeing generally in starts within single family, how do you think about the industry's ability to continue to improve and perhaps sustain some of this as overall demand continues to move higher? And are there any areas specifically that you're more focused on or where we could perhaps see some issues bubble up again?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So the supply chain is mostly healthy. There are certainly pockets of places where we're continuing to focus. But I think labor, while tight, it's generally available, and we're making -- we're using it efficiently, and it's working. Supply chain, we feel pretty good about. The one area that I'd highlight is electrical components, specifically around switch gear that goes into multifamily buildings, so townhomes and condos. Those are more unique and sometimes customized products that are difficult to find in the cycle. And the lead time to get those things ordered has continued to extend. The other one would be transformer, so transformers that go into the horizontal land development side of things. Those are also in short supply. So a couple of things on the electrical component side. Other than that, I would tell you that labor and supply chain are operating pretty effectively.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. And then thinking about the business longer term, as you\u2019re early starts to come off the peak that we've seen more recently, but you think about the longer-term operating dynamics on the ground today and perhaps how they've changed relative to where we were coming into the pandemic? Are there things that you think you can hold on to so that the ROE can perhaps stabilize a touch higher than that 20% or low 20% range that you were in before COVID?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Susan, I'll try. It's Bob. I think we are seeking to be efficient with our capital. We've got share repurchase activity we highlighted. We've got $400 million that we've done this year already. But we're creating a lot of equity through the earnings of the business. So I think the modeling that you're trying to do doesn't really factor into our decision making, right? We're making investment decisions on ability to generate return over time. Do I think that there's an opportunity to do better than we've done historically? Yes, of course, we can be more efficient with our balance sheet. So we highlighted earlier this year that we had $1 billion of extra capital tied up in-house. We've long talked about trying to increase the optionality of our land book, which would be an opportunity for us as well. We're at 50% today -- 51%, sorry. So I think if we can make progress on those fronts, we have an opportunity to continue to generate really strong returns through time.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a follow-up on that last question. Perhaps if you could just talk if you've got in your mind, an upper limit on the idle cash that you might carry on your balance sheet, going forward? And then also just maybe talk about your appetite for increasing leverage just given the facility in your business?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. I don't know that there's -- I wouldn't want to put guardrails around anything we do. Yes, we've been pretty clear and it's 10-plus years now in terms of how we're going to allocate our capital. We've also been, I think, pretty clear that we don't take a point in time assessment of that. We have a business plan and a model that we've created, and we iterate through time that we use to make the decisions on how to invest that capital and just a refresher in the business first and high return. We want to pay a dividend. We use excess capital to buy back stock we'll manage that against leverage. We've reduced the expected leverage in the business. If you think back a decade ago, we said between 30% and 40% gross debt to cap. We adjusted that 20% to 30%. We're under that today. I think you could see us do lots of things. And I wouldn't want to say, well, if we have more than x dollars of cash, we're going to do something different. We'll continue down the same path. We spent time with the Board working through the different capital decisions we make. And I think that's exactly what will be going forward.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Got it. Thanks, Bob. And then just maybe if you could talk about the improvement relative to pre-pandemic in your gross margins and your returns on inventory, if there's a number you could quantify around production improvements and even more specifically, if the actions you've taken getting back into the off-site construction space, if there's anything to call out there? And maybe just an update on how ICG is doing?\nRyan Marshall:  Yes. Let me take the ICG piece. We're really pleased with how that business is operating. We have two factories up and operational that are doing well for us, and we're very pleased with what we're getting there. We've talked about once we get some additional factories up and open and it's covering a bigger percentage of the business we'll share more detail about the cycle time gains, the cost savings that we're seeing from that business, but we're really pleased with what that team is doing. In terms of the first part of your question, it...\nPablo Shaughnessy: It's interesting. I would tell you, we're -- you're asking if there are productivity gains. If I understood the question correctly, you're asking if there are productivity gains that we've gained by virtue of the pandemic that we might be able to save post pandemic. I would tell you exactly the opposite is true. We have a less efficient business, and it shows up in our cycle times, right? And the supply chain dynamics caused us to lose production efficiency. And you heard Ryan say it a minute ago, we think we've got opportunity to improve from here on that.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: That\u2019s great, I appreciate that. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Your line is open.\nAlex Barron : Yes. Thanks, guys. Just to ask again on the ICG. Is there any plans to roll this out to more markets near term?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alex, when we made our first acquisition around our off-site our off-site manufacturing efforts. We said we believe we can have up to about eight plants that will impact about 70% of our overall production volume. That's still the path that we're on. We're -- we haven't announced any new openings, but the strategic direction of eight plants over time and 70% of the business still holds firm.\nAlex Barron: Got it. And I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you guys give your land position and owned an option?\nRyan Marshall: I gave the total control, but I give you the owned is 14,000 lots. The option is 110,000 lots for a total control of 214,000 lots.\nAlex Barron: Got it. And in terms of direction, obviously, a lot of builders, I guess, yourselves included kind of slowdown acquisition of lots at the end of last year, but are you guys seeing the next few months is something that will reaccelerate or just still kind of hold near current levels?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alex, we gave -- we kind of gave our updated land guide, which is at $4 billion, which is a lot of money. It's not an insignificant investment in our overall land portfolio. Roughly half of that is new acquisition. The other half of that spend is on development on lots that we already own. 214,000 lots gives us certainly ample runway and supply for our go-forward business and going back to some of the answers that I gave on similar questions earlier, we're really confident in our land acquisitions team to continue to find good spots, negotiate what we believe are fair in market prices that will continue to help us generate industry-leading returns and gross margins and help us continue to grow the business.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just talk about the sort of specific drivers of the quarter-over-quarter step-up in gross margin in the second quarter? And then what drove upside relative to your guidance from a quarter ago?\nRyan Marshall: You're meaning sequentially, right?\nRafe Jadrosich: Correct.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. So we had highlighted that a couple of things influence it relative to our guide. One is we got better pricing on specs than we were projecting. And the second was the mix of communities that we got closings from looked a little bit different than we thought. So you can see from the sales environment that the market was pretty strong. We were able to translate that in the specs that we saw. Really, those are the two primary drivers that's why we called it out, Rafe [ph].\nRafe Jadrosich: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then you've spoken a little bit about the underwriting strategy going forward. How should we think about your option mix going forward? And like what's the longer-term target relative to the current 51%?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes, we've been pretty clear. We had targeted 50% a year or so ago, we increased that to a target of 70%. We have gotten to a point, I think at the richest, we were at 56%. We walked from about 60,000 lots over the back half of 2022. When you pulled us back down closer to 50%, now we're starting to rebuild again, very large. We had highlighted, we've been able to increase that in this most recent quarter. And again, the target still remains to try to be about 70%.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. And I will now turn the call back to Mr. Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.\nJim Zeumer: I appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. We're around and available to the remainder of the day if you've got any questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, Q2 was an outstanding quarter for PulteGroup, as we posted strong financial results throughout our P&L, balance sheet and cash flow statement. In fact, our second quarter revenues, gross and operating margins and net income were at or are approaching all-time highs for our second quarter.  Our record financial performance in turn drove strong cash flows that helped to raise our cash position to $1.8 billion, while dropping our net debt to capital ratio to almost zero.  I am really proud of our homebuilding and financial services teams, for delivering these great results which are even more impressive given the variable market conditions we've operated in for the past 12 months. Within these complicated market dynamics, I believe PulteGroup's operating and financial success reflects the balanced and disciplined approach we take in running our homebuilding business.  We continue to successfully implement both a build-to-order model that serves our move-up and active adult buyers. In combination with a spec based model primarily within our first-time buyer communities. Our spec production is most heavily weighted toward our Centex branded communities, which operate under a managed spec production model. In other words, homes are started spec, that we have aligned to starts cadence with our sales pace. Given Centex is focused on serving the needs of first-time buyers, our long-term plan is to maintain a spec build model in these communities.  By being more balanced across build-to-order and spec production, we maintain a more consistent cadence of home starts, meet buyer demand more effectively, and we achieve the critical objective of turning our assets in support of higher returns. You can see the practical application of this managed approach in our Q2 numbers, as specs total 36% of units under production at quarter end. Of these units, we averaged just over one finish spec per community, which is in line with our stated goal.  Along with being balanced between our build-to-order and spec production, we were appropriately diversified across all the buyer groups consistent with our long-term goal of having 40% first time 35% move-up and 25% active adult.  Why is this important? The different financial profiles associated with each buyer group can mean different responses to changing market dynamics, such as today's rising rate environment, which may hinder first time buyers, but be less of a headwind among active adult consumers. Being balanced across build-to-order, spec and buyer groups is also an important underpinning to the extremely high gross margins we've been able to maintain. More directly, we have enough production to meet buyer demand, but not so much that we are no longer selling from a position of strength.  I think we've achieved the right mix as we increased orders and closings, all while two-thirds of our divisions are still able to raise prices in the quarter. Along these same lines, we continue to see pricing opportunities within our core build-to-order business that primarily serves our move up and active adult buyers. In our most recent quarter options in law premiums exceeded $100,000 per home. These are high margin dollars that are not as prevalent among first time buyers and certainly were an important driver of the strong 29.6% gross margin we reported in Q2.  When the market started slowing in 2022, I said that we couldn't be margin proud, but rather we had to find price and turn our assets, delivering 24% growth in Q2 orders. And as Bob will detail guiding the margins of 29% or better for the remainder of the year, we are achieving both high margins and high asset turns, which drove our 32% return on equity.  Beyond the company's specific benefits, we're realizing from how we run our business, we appreciate the favorable supply and demand dynamics resulting from the limited stock of existing houses available for sale. National Association of Realtors data for June showed seasonally adjusted existing home sales of 4.2 million, which is down a staggering 1 million homes from June of last year.  As has been well reported, there are millions of existing homeowners who are sitting on low rate mortgages established before the most recent cycle of Fed rate hikes. I recently saw an FHA graph that showed that more than 50% of current mortgage holders have a rate below 4%. I haven't seen any rate forecasts that show the country getting back to 4% mortgages anytime soon.  So it's likely that existing homes remain in short supply for the foreseeable future. FHA data, along with mortgage rate forecasts suggests that there may be an extended period during which mortgage rates stay above 5%, which likely prevents an oversupply of existing homes being released into the market.  Through the first six months of 2023, we generated $1.3 billion of net income and $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations. As a result, we increased our cash position by almost $700 million, while returning almost $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I think these numbers clearly demonstrate the powerful results our company is delivering. With a backlog of $8.2 billion worth of homes to be built, improving cycle times and a solid land supply, we are well positioned to deliver even stronger performance over the remainder of 2023.  Now let me turn the call over to Bob, for a detailed review of the quarter, Bob? Thanks, Bob. As we've commented, homebuyer demand in the second quarter was strong and continued to exceed the expectation we had coming into the year. In the overwhelming majority of our markets, local pricing dynamics are stable to positive, and we continue to find opportunities to modestly increase net pricing in many of our communities. Further, at an absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month for the period, sales pace for the second quarter was above last year and generally above our pre-COVID averages. Demand in the second quarter was fairly consistent from month to month. And as you would anticipate, with a 24% increase in orders, we generally saw positive demand across our markets, which has continued into the month of July. That being said, on a relative basis, there are communities in our Western markets where we are still having to adjust pricing and/or incentives to entice buyers into our communities and ensure we continue to turn our assets. Given the higher interest rate environment, one of the changes we have seen is the slight increase in the number of cash buyers, particularly among our active adult customers. As this buyer group moves into our plans for retirement, they are making the decision to carry less mortgage debt given today's higher rates.  At the other end of the price spectrum, final purchase decisions among first-time buyers are also being impacted by higher rates. As data suggests, some first-time buyers are opting to go with less square footage or fewer options and upgrades as buyers need to purchase a home in today's dynamic market environment is why our ability to offer a significant mortgage incentive nationally is such an effective sales tool. With that said, our first-time buyers remain financially resilient as personal savings remain the primary source of down payment. At the same time, we continue to see millennials are getting self-support from parents if they need help making the move into homeownership. One final note as to buyer sentiment, recent feedback from our first-time buyers indicate that an overwhelming majority bought a new construction Pulte home rather than an existing home because they felt it offered the best overall value. We've been extremely thoughtful about the home designs we are putting on the ground and the incentives we are offering to help ensure we are offering a compelling value to our customers. These comments in combination with our 28% increase in second quarter orders within the first-time buyer group indicate our efforts are meeting with success.  In closing, I want to thank the entire PulteGroup team for their efforts in delivering such outstanding operating and financial results. Beyond the numbers we show in our financial statements, and continue to provide exceptional homes and home buying experiences to our customers. I will now turn the call back to Jim. John, good morning. It's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with how all of our consumer groups have been performing and certainly, how we saw the strength of sign-ups by consumer group in the most recent quarter. The mix of business, I think, is very consistent with what you've seen from us over the past 12 months. And as we mentioned in some of our prepared remarks, it's totally in line with kind of our stated goals. So really nothing there that I would highlight of note. And then in terms of kind of the forward kind of margin profile, we've given both a guide for Q3 and Q4, which I think what you want to read into that is that's where we see the business for the balance of the year, we're clearly not giving anything kind of beyond that at this point. Yes, John, we've actually seen that be pretty stable in terms of the number of orders that are coming from our spec production, which is part of the reason we spent quite a bit of time talking about that today. We like the investment community to understand that the way we're running our production machine is very specific and intentional by buyer group.  Specifically, to your point with the first-time buyer group, that business is predominantly a spec business for us. The margins are lower to your point, which is a reversion to what we saw in pre-COVID kind of times that our first-time business was our lowest margin. We typically get a couple of hundred basis points higher out of our move-up and family business. And then our highest margin will come out of our active adult communities.  We're definitely seeing that today. That's the other point that I would really highlight for you in kind of the guide that we've given for margins for the balance of the year. A big part of our business or a big chunk of our business is from our first time entry-level business, which is all incorporated into that guide. Yes, Mike. I'll let Bob maybe give you a little more detail on kind of the discounts in the quarter, which we actually -- we've seen kind of come down just a tab sequentially. So, in terms of the discounts, we are effectively using our discount money toward mortgage rate buydowns. It's particularly affected with that first-time buyer.  I think the reports and some of the data that's out there on mortgage rate environment, which suggests the sweet spot for most buyers is somewhere around 5.5%. So for us, it's really been to reallocating incentive dollars away from things that buyers may have previously used those incentives toward we're finding a lot of those incentives are being used in the mortgage rate environment. Yes, Carl. Two things there. We did see price increases in some of our communities in two-thirds of the division. So it wasn't every division, it wasn't every single community. But we are seeing pockets of strength where we're able to, to your question, I'll answer the affirmative, it is a net increase in net pricing and it's coming through all of the options that you listed. So there are modest increases. And those are -- I would note that those are off of what we would consider adjusted kind of current cycle floor pricing. So we feel like we've seen a bit of strengthening in the overall sales environment, which allowed us to modestly increase pricing. Yes, Carl. I don't have a specific number for you on backlog conversion of that specific buyer group. We could follow up with you offline on that. The things that we're really monitoring there, we're running a -- with that spec business, specifically, we're running a predictable and consistent monthly with start rate. And we've worked to match that start rate to what we believe our monthly sales rate has been, is and will be. And so it's part of what you heard me talk about in my prepared remarks around getting our start rate matched to the sales rate, which we think we've effectively done. And then the second question cycle times, Carl, yes, we're starting to see those come down very much in line with our anticipated improvements throughout the year. It's not been easy, it's been a lot of hard work by our procurement teams, our construction managers and certainly our trade partners that have helped us to reduce those cycle times. So we're seeing at least a couple of weeks come out of the cycle times and certainly starts that are going in the ground today. We'd expect to maybe even get a little bit more by the time that those deliver. That's been a big contributor to our success, not only in Q2, but to the updated and increased guide for full year closings that we've provided today. Yes, Stephen. I'm reluctant to answer your first question because we haven't provided any view beyond the third and fourth quarters. And so I'm going to pass on that. And then in terms of the absorption paces, we haven't provided that level of detail. What I can tell you is that in the current operating environment, the quickest-growing part of the business is move-up right now, interestingly enough. So absorptions there grew faster. We had absorption growth across all three demographics. And so we had highlighted 28% growth in the first time, 33% in the move-up and 7% in the active adult. But on a per store basis, all of them were up. The richest contributor to that actually was the move-up space. Yes. Matthew, I think that's the biggest driver is there's just such a shortage of supply and fewer options for that move-up buyer to choose from. So as a percentage of the available choices that are out there, new homes have become a much bigger piece of that. And I think you're seeing our move-up business benefit from that. I would share that we've got great communities, we've got excellent designs. The quality of the homes that we're building, I think, are really speaking to that move-up buyer that's looking to add more space or get a newer, more energy-efficient, more technological advanced homes.  So I think those things are working to our advantage as well. And in this higher interest rate environment, our ability to offer our national mortgage rate incentive program to the move-up buyer is meaningful as well. That's a tool that we're able to effectively leverage that the resale market is not at the same degree. So I think a number of factors there with the headline being there's just less inventory out there. Yes, Alan, thanks for the questions. Ryan. A couple of things. Maybe I'd start with there. For starters, we actually did increase our projected land spend number about a quarter ago. So when we went into the year, I think we were right around $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. We've moved that up with the high end and as high as $4 billion, certainly down from last year, and that was intentional.  When we look at our controlled lot supply, we've got 215,000 lots, plus or minus, under control. Over half of those are controlled via options. So we feel pretty good about kind of what's in the pipeline and what that will mean for the business. Market share and growth are certainly part of our story and part of the things that we're trying to do with our strategy.  To your question, Alan, around what are we seeing in the land market, I'd tell you that we're able to get deals done. It is a competitive market, and there certainly isn't anything that's being liquidated or fire sold, but we are to -- our land teams are doing a nice job finding good opportunities, and we've stayed consistent with our disciplined underwriting process, which has yielded the types of results and quarters that we've delivered over the last several years. So our plan is to stick with that to continue, to stay very balanced and disciplined and running a good business and being really laser focused on picking our spots with where we're investing more capital.  So to this point, I don't think we need to do anything along the lines of put the pedal to the metal. I think we're going to continue to be foot on the gas, but we're going to continue to focus on monetizing the 214,000 lots that we have, which we'll see what the market holds, but I think that will give us an opportunity to continue to run a very nice business that will grow in the market. Yes, Alan. We haven't seen it become a problem for buyers to make the decision to move into our Florida communities. And in fact, our Florida business has been one of our strongest best-performing regions. And we've got a very diversified business in Florida that ranges from entry level to a heavy move-up business in Tampa and Orlando. And then when you get into South Florida, our active adult consumer and second home buyers are very prevalent. We've got great businesses there. Part of our financial services operation, we have an insurance company. We aggregate and we talk about the numbers and the business that they generate as part of our overall financial service portfolio. But we find that our captive insurance agency does a nice job helping to solve some of those problems.  Florida is one of those places, Alan, and I think over the years. There's been an ebb and flow of insurers that are in the market, they leave, they come back, having lived in Florida personally for a long time. I saw that happened over the last 15 years with my own insurance companies, but they wouldn't renew, they'd leave for a few years and then inevitably, they come back and they want the business again. So we'll keep an eye on it. California is the other state that there's been a lot in the news media recently about a lot of insurance companies that have left the state due to large losses. So certainly, things that we want to keep an eye on. I would highlight that there are -- there is a view that new homes performed better. They're in -- from a flood standpoint, they're up to spec out of the flood plain, higher than homes that have been developed in recent past. The drainage systems are more prevalent. They're built to current code. You've got new electrical, they're more energy efficient. So there's an argument to say there's potentially less risk with newer constructed homes. Yes, Truman, we're -- look, we're always balancing our production machine with the amount of developed land that we have in front of us as well as what our trade capacity is. But other than a unique community here or there that is way oversubscribed, we're not in the type of allocation restriction mode that we saw maybe during COVID. Yes. I think we highlighted that some of that in our prepared remarks, and there was a question earlier, we have in certain geographies and certain communities have been able to modestly increase prices from what was arguably a pricing floor after we made adjustments late last year. So part of that is related to an effective use of the mortgage incentive, which we've used to help solve some affordability challenges. But part of that is there's a real shortage of inventory and the market is allowing us to make some modest price increases. So all of that's kind of reflected in the results that we had for Q2 as well as the guide that we've given for the balance of this year. Yes. We actually believe that we still got opportunity to continue to do more. And Bob highlighted it in the question that he just answered a minute ago for Truman. As it relates to cash, as we feel that we've got opportunity to continue to reduce cycle time, not only in the balance of this year, but well into '24. It's predominantly coming from a healing of the supply chain and removing a lot of the inefficiencies that crept in, given -- but we had a broken supply chain and trades were incredibly inefficient. So we're making progress. We're pleased with it, but we're probably nowhere near where we'd like to be. Our target still remains getting back to pre-COVID cycle times, which is where I think the company can operate. Yes. So the supply chain is mostly healthy. There are certainly pockets of places where we're continuing to focus. But I think labor, while tight, it's generally available, and we're making -- we're using it efficiently, and it's working. Supply chain, we feel pretty good about. The one area that I'd highlight is electrical components, specifically around switch gear that goes into multifamily buildings, so townhomes and condos. Those are more unique and sometimes customized products that are difficult to find in the cycle. And the lead time to get those things ordered has continued to extend. The other one would be transformer, so transformers that go into the horizontal land development side of things. Those are also in short supply. So a couple of things on the electrical component side. Other than that, I would tell you that labor and supply chain are operating pretty effectively. Yes. Let me take the ICG piece. We're really pleased with how that business is operating. We have two factories up and operational that are doing well for us, and we're very pleased with what we're getting there. We've talked about once we get some additional factories up and open and it's covering a bigger percentage of the business we'll share more detail about the cycle time gains, the cost savings that we're seeing from that business, but we're really pleased with what that team is doing. In terms of the first part of your question, it... Yes, Alex, when we made our first acquisition around our off-site our off-site manufacturing efforts. We said we believe we can have up to about eight plants that will impact about 70% of our overall production volume. That's still the path that we're on. We're -- we haven't announced any new openings, but the strategic direction of eight plants over time and 70% of the business still holds firm. I gave the total control, but I give you the owned is 14,000 lots. The option is 110,000 lots for a total control of 214,000 lots. Yes, Alex, we gave -- we kind of gave our updated land guide, which is at $4 billion, which is a lot of money. It's not an insignificant investment in our overall land portfolio. Roughly half of that is new acquisition. The other half of that spend is on development on lots that we already own. 214,000 lots gives us certainly ample runway and supply for our go-forward business and going back to some of the answers that I gave on similar questions earlier, we're really confident in our land acquisitions team to continue to find good spots, negotiate what we believe are fair in market prices that will continue to help us generate industry-leading returns and gross margins and help us continue to grow the business. You're meaning sequentially, right? Yes. So we had highlighted that a couple of things influence it relative to our guide. One is we got better pricing on specs than we were projecting. And the second was the mix of communities that we got closings from looked a little bit different than we thought. So you can see from the sales environment that the market was pretty strong. We were able to translate that in the specs that we saw. Really, those are the two primary drivers that's why we called it out, Rafe [ph]."

            "content": "Thanks, Ryan and good morning. Our second quarter numbers speak for themselves in terms of demonstrating the strength of our operations, and in turn overall housing demand, so I'll just dive right in.  Our second quarter wholesale revenues totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% over last year. Higher revenues for the quarter were driven by a 5% increase in closings to 7,518 homes, in combination with a 3% increase in average sales price to $540,000. Our ability to meet stronger demand in the period with available spec inventory allowed us to slightly exceed our prior closing guidance.  For the quarter our mix of closings was comprised of 41% first time buyers, 34% move-up buyers and 25% active adult buyers. The breakdown of our business remains in line with our stated targets of 40% first time, 35% move-up and 25% active adult. In the second quarter of last year, our closing mix was 36% first time, 38% move-up and 26% active adult.  Our net new orders in the second quarter increased 24% over last year to 7,947 homes. The double-digit increase in our orders benefited from the overall strength of market demand in the period along with our ability to capture this demand through a 14% increase in our average community count to 903 neighborhoods.  The strength of consumer demand is also evident in our cancellation rate. Cancellations as a percentage of beginning period backlog was 9% in this quarter, which is down almost 350 basis points on a sequential basis from the first quarter.  The 24% increase in our second quarter net new orders reflects an increase in our absorption pace of 2.9 homes per month, up from 2.7 homes per month last year and resulted in higher net new orders across all buyer groups. In the period net new orders from first time buyers increased 28% over the prior year to 3,150 home. Orders for move-up buyers increased 33% to 2,897 homes and orders from active adult buyers increased 7% to 1900 homes.  The year-over-year increase in first time buyer orders shows that our homes continue to offer a compelling value and meet the affordability requirements of this buyer group. At the same time, our higher net new orders in move-up and active adult buyers is a positive development and test to the broad mix strength of housing demand.  Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect year-over-year community count growth of 5% to 10% in the third and fourth quarters, each month compared to the comparable prior year period. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was 13,588 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. In the second quarter of last year, our backlog stood at 19,176 homes, valued at a record peak of $11.6 billion.  We ended the second quarter with a total of 16,740 homes under construction, of which approximately 6000 or 36% were spec. We continue to closely manage spec production as total specs under construction at quarter end were down 11% from last year. Finished specs are also consistent with our historical carry rate as we ended the quarter with about one finished spec per community.  In the second quarter, we started approximately 7,400 homes, which is up 41% compared to the first quarter of this year. Given the strength of PulteGroup's year intake orders and deliveries coupled with the status of our backlog and production universe, we're establishing a full year 2023 delivery target of 29,500 homes. Of this total we would expect to deliver between 7000 and 7,400 homes in the third quarter.  Our third quarter and full year delivery targets are benefiting from improved home construction cycle times, as our operations are realizing meaningful improvements in cycle times of homes they are starting today. Based on the mix of backlog homes we expect to deliver in the third and fourth quarters coupled with anticipated spec closings we are projecting in those periods, we expect the average sales price on third and fourth quarter closing to be approximately $540,000.  Turning to margins, our reported gross margin in the second quarter was 29.6%. The improvement in our margins as compared to our previous guide was due to improve pricing on spec sales and increased closings from our higher margin markets, features compared to our prior estimates. In addition, as we discussed in our prior earnings call, our aggregate gross margins are benefiting from our move-up and active adult business, where profitability is holding up better.  Based on current market dynamics, we expect to maintain the strong margin position throughout the remainder of '23. And expect our gross margin to be in the range of 29.0% to 29.5%, in both the third and fourth quarter of this year. As we experienced for the second quarter the actual mix of deliveries, both in terms of geography and buyer groups may impact our reported numbers.  Our reported SG&A expense in the second quarter was $315 million, or 7.8% of home sale revenues, and included a $65 million pretax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In the second quarter of last year, our SG&A expense was $351 million, or 9.3% of home sale revenues. Based on our delivery targets for the remainder of the year, we expect SG&A expense to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5% of home sale revenues in the third quarter in the range of 8% to 8.5% of home sale revenues in the fourth quarter.  Second quarter pretax income generated by our financial services operations increased 16% over last year to $46 million. Pricing conditions remain highly competitive in the mortgage industry, but quarterly earnings benefited from improved profitability within our title and insurance operations. Capture rate in the second quarter improved to 80% compared with 78% last year.  Our reported tax expense in the second quarter was $233 million for an effective tax rate of 24.4%. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of '23 to be 24.5%. On the bottom line, our reported second quarter net income was a record $740 million or $3.21 per share. This was up from last year's reported net income of $652 million or $2.73 per share. Capitalizing on our outstanding financial results and resulting cash flows, we've repurchased 3.7 million common shares in the quarter at a cost of $250 million, at an average price of $68.31 per share. Through the first six months of '23, we have used $400 million to repurchase 6.4 million shares or 2.8% of our common shares outstanding. We also invested $370 million in land acquisition and $523 million in related development during the quarter. In total, our land sale in the period was $893 million, which is down from $1.1 billion through the second quarter of last year. On a year-to-date basis, this year, we have invested $1.8 billion in land acquisition development, which keeps us on track to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion for the full year. At the end of the second quarter, we had 214,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The total number of lots we control and the percentage of lots we controlled via option both increased from Q1 of this year as we are working to rebuild our option lot supply after exiting positions in the back half of 2022.  We also ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and a gross debt-to-capital ratio of 17.3%. Given our large cash position, our net debt to capital ratio is now below 3%. Looking briefly at our full year results, on a year-to-date basis, we have generated net income of $1.3 billion, drove the book value of our stock by 12% and returned $472 million to shareholders. At the same time, our financial performance has permitted us to reduce our financial leverage to historic lows, and we have generated a return on equity for the trailing 12 months of 32%. Thank you, and I'll turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Sorry, yes, there's no shoe, right? We have provided a guide. And so if you're focused on sales activity from the back half of '22, it has either closed or somewhat limited circumstances will close over the next three to six months. So it's in our P&L already or reflected in the guide that we have given. The relativity of our markets to the space, if you think about it, our margins didn't go up quite as much in '21 and into the beginning half of '22. And part of the reason for that was we didn't have as much spec production as others did.  And so they were pricing product at the time it was completed, getting full value for it whereas we were contracting often times three and six and nine months ahead of time. And so some of the price appreciation that went on in the market during the time we were constructing the home, we didn't feel the full benefit of that in our margin profile then. And so you saw kind of the really spec-heavy builders capturing every dollar of value. Now against the next -- if you think about the back half of '23-- sorry, of '22 and into '23, they were once again pricing at market. They had the full cost of a heavy lumber load, honestly, and an inflationary environment influencing their cost structure and prices weren't running quite as quickly, particularly in that entry level. So I think their reversion reflected the underwriting of land that they bought and the timing of their construction. Ours, again, for that spec business, we are fully engaged now on that. Again, that is -- you're seeing that in our margins today. It's always worth it to highlight we typically play at a little bit higher price point in that entry-level business, a little bit closer in. And so it's not quite apples-to-apples with some of our competitive set. So I don't want to sound defensive, but there's nothing really unique in this quarter's margin or we would have called it out. There's nothing unique that's coming in the next couple of quarters and the margin is going to stay pretty strong. Yes, it's a couple of things. One, we are an inflationary environment. Our land is more expensive, labor is more expensive, materials more expensive. You can see lumbers trending up given the faster cycle some of that is going to come into our production in the back half of the year. And then certainly, the mix on a geographic basis matters. And so we'll see some contributions from some margin communities that we've had to adjust as we've gone through the year. It's normal. So I know it's a non-answer, but mix always matters in that conversation. Yes. As always, as Ryan said, land is not on sale. We have not seen opportunities on large-scale things for banks or private market transactions of any substance. And in terms of the current activity levels, I think it's a combination of both and it probably depends on where you are in the country.  There are parts of the country where we have seen some willingness to negotiate on land because the market is a little stickier than it was 18 or 24 months ago. But by and large, no, the market is pretty firm. And we are -- we have not changed our underwriting screen at all. Based on activity levels that we see and can project, we're able to make them underwrite, but they're not on sale. Yes. I think on the land side, and we always answer it this way, we don't have any ramp up or ramp down in our land portfolio. And so the normal inflationary aspect we see comes if we buy land in three-year increments. We develop it. We then build on it and cost it off. And so we've seen a pretty steady increase. I wouldn't want to put a particular percentage on it because it varies on when we are in the -- if you think over the last five years, the way pricing has moved. On the vertical side and even on the horizontal development side to get outside of the acquisition side of the dirt, we came into the year projecting, call it, 12% to 14% increase in costs. We've been able to dial that down. We highlighted on the last call, we were 8% to 9%. We're still there. So our total house cost is up about that year-over-year, and that's going to be inclusive of lumber save earlier in the year. It started to pick back up, materials and labor is the real driver of that. We've been able to work with our trades to try and find efficiencies. Ryan talked about it.  We want to be a production consistent cadence of starts, consistency in the production cycle that makes it easier for the trades. And now that the supply chain is healthier, we've been able to reduce some of the cost increases through efficiency, not on the purchasing side for materials because, again, that inflationary aspect is there. And when you kind of wash all that together, we're seeing costs up, like I said, 8% to 9%. Yes. We haven't given guide on that Tru, but you're exactly right. I mean, if you think about it, we generated $1.5 billion through the first six months of the year. And if you put, I think, the closing volumes and the cost estimates for margins and for SG&A, the operating margin on that forward business at a sales price of $540 million is pretty rich. And certainly, inventory levels will change. But we think actually that we have an opportunity to reduce our investment in-house over the balance of the year because of the improvement in cycle times. So to your point, we're going to generate a bunch of cash in the back half of the year. Susan, I'll try. It's Bob. I think we are seeking to be efficient with our capital. We've got share repurchase activity we highlighted. We've got $400 million that we've done this year already. But we're creating a lot of equity through the earnings of the business. So I think the modeling that you're trying to do doesn't really factor into our decision making, right? We're making investment decisions on ability to generate return over time. Do I think that there's an opportunity to do better than we've done historically? Yes, of course, we can be more efficient with our balance sheet. So we highlighted earlier this year that we had $1 billion of extra capital tied up in-house. We've long talked about trying to increase the optionality of our land book, which would be an opportunity for us as well. We're at 50% today -- 51%, sorry. So I think if we can make progress on those fronts, we have an opportunity to continue to generate really strong returns through time. Yes. I don't know that there's -- I wouldn't want to put guardrails around anything we do. Yes, we've been pretty clear and it's 10-plus years now in terms of how we're going to allocate our capital. We've also been, I think, pretty clear that we don't take a point in time assessment of that. We have a business plan and a model that we've created, and we iterate through time that we use to make the decisions on how to invest that capital and just a refresher in the business first and high return. We want to pay a dividend. We use excess capital to buy back stock we'll manage that against leverage. We've reduced the expected leverage in the business. If you think back a decade ago, we said between 30% and 40% gross debt to cap. We adjusted that 20% to 30%. We're under that today. I think you could see us do lots of things. And I wouldn't want to say, well, if we have more than x dollars of cash, we're going to do something different. We'll continue down the same path. We spent time with the Board working through the different capital decisions we make. And I think that's exactly what will be going forward. It's interesting. I would tell you, we're -- you're asking if there are productivity gains. If I understood the question correctly, you're asking if there are productivity gains that we've gained by virtue of the pandemic that we might be able to save post pandemic. I would tell you exactly the opposite is true. We have a less efficient business, and it shows up in our cycle times, right? And the supply chain dynamics caused us to lose production efficiency. And you heard Ryan say it a minute ago, we think we've got opportunity to improve from here on that. Yes, we've been pretty clear. We had targeted 50% a year or so ago, we increased that to a target of 70%. We have gotten to a point, I think at the richest, we were at 56%. We walked from about 60,000 lots over the back half of 2022. When you pulled us back down closer to 50%, now we're starting to rebuild again, very large. We had highlighted, we've been able to increase that in this most recent quarter. And again, the target still remains to try to be about 70%."

Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Audra. Good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining today\u2019s call. As you read in this morning\u2019s press release, PulteGroup had an exceptional first quarter and we are excited to discuss our operating and financial results. Participating on today\u2019s call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Pablo Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. As noted in this morning\u2019s earnings release, to be more consistent with industry reporting practices, effective with our first quarter 2023 reporting, the company has reclassified closing cost incentives and cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. This reclassification impacted the company\u2019s reported home sale revenues and associated average sales price as well as home sale gross margin and SG&A percentages, but had no impact on reported earnings. An analysis of the impacts on the current quarter in comparable prior year period is included in this morning\u2019s press release and can be found in our webcast slides associated with today\u2019s call. Our comments today reflect these changes for all periods referenced. Also, I want to inform everyone that today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim and good morning. Based on the improving demand dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, we were cautiously optimistic heading into 2023. I am extremely pleased to report that the market momentum that began building in Q4 continued to expand into the first quarter of 2023. Today\u2019s stronger market conditions, combined with actions implemented by our outstanding field teams to enhance our competitive position helped drive our first \u2013 strong first quarter results that included a 15% growth in home sale revenues, a 100 basis point increase in operating margin and a 28% increase in earnings per share. Among the actions we have taken has been to increase our production of spec homes, a strategy we began implementing in the back half of 2022. As discussed on previous earnings calls, we made the decision to increase spec starts as we saw the opportunity to realize a number of strategic benefits within our homebuilding operations. With more units in production, we can better meet buyer demand as more consumers are seeking quick move-in homes as a hedge against rising mortgage rates. By maintaining the level of spec starts, we can commit to a more consistent start cadence. This is particularly valuable in today\u2019s environment when negotiating with our trades and suppliers. Keeping units in production allows us to turn assets more efficiently which is critical to delivering high returns over the housing cycle. The importance of having an appropriate inventory of spec homes available can be seen in our first quarter sign-ups, which on a gross basis increased 1% over last year to 8,900 homes. Of these sign-ups, almost 60% were spec sales, so the decision to increase spec starts was the right one. That said I want to be clear that our strategy is to keep starts directionally in alignment with market demand. We believe this balanced approach is consistent with both these historic business practices and allows us to turn our assets while maintaining a better margin profile. Our first quarter results show that we are successfully executing against this strategy as we realized strong sales while still delivering exceptional gross margins of 29.1%. You have heard me say that we won\u2019t be margin proud, but we also won\u2019t sacrifice profits if we don\u2019t have to. By being more measured in our starts cadence, we can meet buyer demand while not oversupplying the market. Case in point, we ended the first quarter with 1,500 fewer specs in production than we started the quarter. This gives us flexibility to maintain or increase production volumes, which in today\u2019s market is an important lever when working with trades and suppliers. As it relates to overall housing demand, home sales are benefiting from recent declines in mortgage rates, but I also think just having a general sense of stability in rates is important to consumer confidence. Given improvements in demand conditions in the broader interest rate environment as well as a generally limited inventory of existing homes, we are starting to see the pressure on selling prices ease in many of our markets. In fact, and well over half of our markets, we have found opportunities to pull back on incentives and/or move prices higher in many of our communities. While the price changes are modest, it demonstrates the point that people desire home ownership and are willing to buy when they see value. Earlier this month, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that looked at the housing shortage in this country. The article raised the point that depending upon which expert you ask, the housing shortage ranges from 2 million to 7 million houses. While there are certainly debates about the number, I think there is broad agreement that we have a housing shortage. I believe this is one of the reasons homebuyers are quick to respond when affordability pressures can be eased. Before turning the call over to Bob, let me take a minute to address impacts on credit availability given recent disruptions in the banking industry, particularly among the regional banks. The short answer is that we have not experienced any disruptions. On the mortgage side, we are advantaged by having a captive financial services operation that routinely originates mortgages for between 75% to 80% of Pulte homebuyers that require financing. On the project side, big builders such as PulteGroup, self-fund or have access to capital that smaller builders typically cannot match. In the end, it maybe that recent disturbances in the banking sector may create opportunities for PulteGroup to put its more than $2 billion in total liquidity to work. I am very proud of our team as PulteGroup delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter. I am also highly encouraged by the improving demand conditions we have been experiencing over the past two quarters. And I would add that buyer demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of April. While we have and will continue to take steps to best position PulteGroup for success within today\u2019s changing market dynamics, we remain measured and disciplined in our actions. From production rates and land spends to overheads and share repurchases, we remain focused on delivering performance over the long-term. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter.\nPablo Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we have reclassified closing cost incentives from cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. The total incentive reclassified amounts is $81 million in the first quarter of this year and $38 million in the first quarter of last year. This reclassification impacted our reported home sales revenue and associated average sales prices as well as our reported home sale gross margin and SG&A percentages. An analysis of the impact of this reclassification in the current quarter and prior year periods is included in today\u2019s webcast slides. Where appropriate, any numbers referenced in my comments, current, past or future are inclusive of this reclass. Let me now get started with a review of our first quarter results. Home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 15% over the prior year to a first quarter record of $3.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect a 6% increase in closings to 6,394 homes and a 9% increase in average sales price to $545,000. On a year-over-year basis, we realized higher average sales prices across all buyer groups, led by double-digit gains in both move-up and active adult. In the quarter, we reported 6,394 closings, which represents a 6% increase over the comparable prior year period. Our closings for the quarter came in above our guide as we capitalized on stronger demand for spec homes, an improvement in select areas of our supply chain that allowed us to close additional homes in the period. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our procurement and construction teams working in partnership with our trades and suppliers for their contributions over the last several quarters. Their efforts during a time of extraordinary market volatility were instrumental to the operating success we have achieved. Looking at the mix of our closings in the quarter, our results included 39% from first-time buyers, 35% for move-up buyers and 26% from active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the closing mix was 34% first-time, 40% move-up and 26% active adult. The higher percentage of closings from first-time buyers reflects our increased investment in that part of our business over the last several years as well as an increase in the availability of spec homes in our first-time communities, resulting from our decision to increase spec production to the back half of 2022. Looking at our orders in the quarter, our net new orders totaled 7,354 homes, which is down 8% from the prior year. Our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog was 13% in the first quarter, which is up from 4% last year. On a sequential basis, the 13% cancellation rate is up less than 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. So cancellations are beginning to stabilize. In fact, on a unit basis, cancellations in this quarter amounted to 1,544 homes, which is down sequentially from 1,871 homes in the fourth quarter. By buyer group, net new orders to first-time buyers increased 18% over the prior year to 3,177 homes, while move-up orders decreased by 20% to 2,645 homes, and active adult orders were lower by 22% to 1,532 homes. Our average community count in the first quarter increased 13% over last year to $879. Based on the communities opened in the period, our absorption pace of 2.8 homes per month was down from the prior year, but in line with our pre-pandemic sales rate, which averaged 2.7 for the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020. Based on land investments we made in prior years, we expect to operate out of approximately 900 communities in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of 14% over the second quarter of last year. Looking over the balance of the year, we continue to expect community count growth of 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. Given our expanding community count, PulteGroup is well positioned to increase its market share within the improving demand environment. We ended the first quarter with a backlog of 13,129 homes with a value of $8 billion. This compares with last year\u2019s Q1 record backlog of 19,935 homes valued at $11.5 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 16,872 homes under construction, of which 15% were finished. Spec units represented 38% of our production, which is up from last year and consistent with our strategy to have specs available to meet buyer demand for homes that can close sooner. Over the course of the first quarter, we started production on approximately 5,200 homes. This start rate was down about 40% from the first quarter of last year, but up on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to drive an appropriate start cadence as we focus on turning our assets. Based on the roughly 17,000 homes we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to deliver between 7,000 and 7,400 homes in the second quarter. Given the ongoing improvement in the overall operating environment, we are pleased by the level of production we have been able to realize, thanks to the efforts of our outstanding operating teams. In addition to these higher unit volumes, we are also seeing the beginning stages of a shortening in our production cycle. At this point, depending upon the market, the gains range from just a few days to a few weeks, but the trends are generally positive. Based on our strong Q1 results and the potential for cycle times to gradually improve, the production potential of homes will have available to close in 2023 has increased to 27,000, 28,000 homes. This is up from our initial guide of 25,000 loans. Obviously, the strength of sign-ups in the second quarter will go a long way in determining how much of this production universe actually converts into 2023 closings. While the average sales price in our backlog is $608,000, we currently expect the average sales price to our second quarter closings to be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. That estimate reflects both the mix of homes scheduled to close as well as the impact of anticipated spec closings, which are primarily first-time homes that have a lower average sales price. We reported first quarter gross margins of 29.1% which was 20 basis points below last year. Please note that our reported gross margins in the first quarter benefited by approximately 70 basis points from the reclass of closing incentives and cost of sales to net revenue. The benefit to our first quarter 2022 gross margin was 40 basis points. I would highlight that in the current quarter, our margins benefited from our move-up and active adult business where pressures on our selling prices have been relatively less impactful compared with entry level homes. After several years of gross margin parity across buyer groups, we are seeing a reversion to the historic trend of higher margins in our move-up and active adult business. Based on the mix of homes we plan to close in the second quarter, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. As with our closings and reported margins in the first quarter, deliveries in the second quarter will reflect the benefit of lower lumber costs that are flowing through our operations. In the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $337 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our SG&A expense was $329 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Higher closings and associated revenues in this year\u2019s first quarter drove the improved overhead leverage relative to last year and our guide. With expected 2023 production volumes moving higher, we are carefully adding sales and construction staff, but still expect to maintain overhead leverage. As such, we expect second quarter SG&A to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5%. In the first quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $14 million, which is down from $41 million in the prior year. Pre-tax income in the period was impacted by lower loan volumes, competitive pricing dynamics and higher mortgage incentives being used throughout the industry. In Q1, our capture rate was 78% compared with 81% last year. Market conditions have clearly improved, but as we do under all market conditions, we continue to routinely reassess our own planned positions and pending land transactions. Based on this review process, in the first quarter, we walked away from 5,300 lots that were previously held under option and wrote off approximately $6 million in associated deposits and pre-acquisition costs. In the first quarter, our reported tax expense was $170 million or an effective tax rate of 24.2%. We expect our tax rate in the second quarter to be 24.5%. Our net income for the first quarter was $532 million or $2.35 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $455 million or $1.83 per share. In addition to significantly higher net income, our earnings per share benefited from the company\u2019s share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.8 billion common shares at a cost of $150 million or an average price of $54.30 per share. Consistent with our plans to continue returning excess funds to our shareholders, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available under the program to $1.2 billion. Along with returning funds to our shareholders, we continue to strategically invest in our business. In the first quarter, we invested $906 million of land acquisition and development, down from $1.1 billion in Q1 of last year. Given the stronger demand environment and the increase in our overall construction activities, we now expect to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in land acquisition development in 2023. We ended the period with 210,000 lots under control. This is consistent with year-end and down 10% from last year. Based on our activity over the past several quarters, 61% of those lots are owned and 49% are options. We will continue to seek increased optionality of our land bank with a target of up to 70% of our lots being controlled via option. Reflecting the strength of our first quarter financial results and associated cash flows, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, which lowered our net debt to capital ratio of 7.2%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 18.1%, down from 21.5% at the end of the first quarter last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. I think there are a lot of positives to be taken out of our first quarter results, including we delivered record first quarter earnings, driven by higher closings, continued strong gross margins and improved overhead leverage. Overall market conditions continue to improve as we experienced strong demands and are finding opportunities to reduce incentives and/or increase prices in many communities. Supply chain conditions are stabilizing, and we have seen at least an initial turn towards shorter cycle times. At this point, the gains have been market-specific but we are optimistic that we\u2019ve seen a high watermark in terms of construction cycle times. Our national and local teams are making strides and climb back construction days, which is critical because shortening our cycle time is an important driver to expanding our 2023 production universe. PulteGroup\u2019s Board approved another $1 billion increase due to the company\u2019s share repurchase authorization. We\u2019ve bought over \u2013 we have bought back over 40% of our shares and clearly remain committed to the systemic return of bonds to our shareholders. One other positive I would highlight is that PulteGroup was once again ranked among the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for. This is our third year on this prestigious list and we again moved higher, climbing from number 43 last year to number 36 in the most recent ranking. We take fry and being included on this list because it is based on what our employees say about their experience as part of the PulteGroup team. Our success in delivering quality homes and delighting our customers starts and ends with our 6,100 employees dedicated to doing the right thing, taking care of our customers, focusing on quality and lifting the teammates around them. The amazing culture resident of PulteGroup doesn\u2019t happen by chance, but rather it comes from a committed effort by every employee to create a world-class culture. I am extremely proud of our team and I want to thank all of our employees, along with our trade partners and suppliers for their tremendous work in helping to deliver another outstanding quarter of operating and financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\nJim Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions so that we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of the call. [Operator Instructions] Andre, do you want to get the process started. We\u2019re prepared for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from John Lovallo at UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is you guys talked about some of the pressure on selling prices easing and the ability to pull back on incentives or even maybe raise prices in some markets. I think 50% of the markets you said \u2013 can you just help us maybe frame which markets you\u2019re seeing the greatest opportunity to kind of pull back on the incentives and maybe the markets where it\u2019s a little bit more challenging at this point?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Sure, John. We\u2019re seeing continued strength in the Florida markets, the Southeast markets in Texas would be the three kind of regions that I would highlight with strength. Our Midwest business continues to be a steady performer. And then in terms of markets that are more challenging, it would really be the western markets, particularly the ones in the \u2013 the high-priced coastal areas Northern California and Seattle, probably being the two that I would highlight.\nJohn Lovallo: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then recognizing that you guys are not a spec builder, I mean, the move-in effort has been \u2013 it\u2019s been helpful, and it\u2019s been meaningful. Maybe could you just help us outline sort of your thoughts on that today? Where do you see this going? And will this be perhaps a slightly bigger piece of the Pulte business than it has historically?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, John, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated exactly that. And I think it shows that when we started really talking about this middle of last year, that specifically with the first-time entry-level business, there was an opportunity to have more homes that were sooner deliveries, which help to alleviate \u2013 it really helped to alleviate pressure around interest rate, rising interest rates. It helped to alleviate pressure around certainty of when things we\u2019re going to deliver and we made the strategic decision to put more spec in the ground. To your point, we\u2019ve historically not been a spec builder, but it\u2019s never been a 0% of our business. We\u2019ve always had specs as part of our business, but we made the decision to make it a bigger piece. It got as much as high as about 45% of our total work in process inventory with spec. And I highlight that number, John, because that matches up pretty well with our Centex business, which is about 40% of our overall business, which is catered towards the entry-level first-time buyer. So in terms of where it goes in the future, we\u2019re going to continue to \u2013 as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, match our spec production with what we think the market demand is. And right now, that\u2019s certainly higher spec production than maybe what we\u2019ve historically done. It\u2019s working for us. And I think this most recent quarter\u2019s results are a great example of how that strategy is working.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: We will go next to Alan Ratner at Zelman.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for the time. Following on that last question, I guess, obviously, it seems like you saw a strong demand for the spec inventory you have on the ground. Would you say the momentum you saw in the market overall was similar in your BTO business as well and the skew towards more spec was just a function of where you had the inventory or do you still see kind of currently more of a desire for those quick moving homes versus build-to-order?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, it\u2019s a good question. I would tell you, broadly, we saw strength in all price points. That being said, there is a higher likelihood of the entry-level buyer transacting at this point in time because they don\u2019t have a home to sell. And so they are not hampered by the low interest rate that they may be hanging on to with their existing home. But look, as we\u2019ve talked in prior calls, life continues to happen for buyers, marriages, more kids, relocations, job promotions all the things that I think create a need for a family and a potential buyer to move into a different home for whatever reason, our move up in our active adult business, they are certainly benefiting from that as well. We are seeing easing of sales price pressure in both the move-up and the active adult segment, which is allowing us to moderately raise prices and moderately pull back on incentives. And I think that demonstrates some of the strength we\u2019re seeing. We intentionally don\u2019t build a lot of spec in those price points. We find the debt buyer group. They prefer to have the build-to-order model. But when it comes to our entry-level first-time SendTech business, we\u2019re leaning in more with the spec first strategy, and it\u2019s working for us.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And I guess on that note, if we think about the price point segmentation and entry level seemingly a bit stronger in the near-term. You kind of alluded to this when you talked about the margin differential reverting back to more historical norms where end level is a bit of a lower margin but higher turn business for you. How should we think about the margin going forward, assuming the mix of the business kind of continues on this current trajectory? You guided for margins to be down about 100 bps sequentially, which probably is some of that mix impact there. But can you quantify exactly what that mix looks like today and what it would look like if this mix holds steady here overall for the business?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it\u2019s Bob. We haven\u2019t given a guide. There is a lot of moving pieces out in the market. So we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility based on our backlog and the sales activity we\u2019re seeing. The commentary was \u2013 if you think about the last several years, there is been sort of a compression in margins. And you saw it both in our results and our peers where some of the folks that were selling entry-level had higher margins than they historically would have \u2013 that was based on availability, pricing dynamics, a lot of different things. What we\u2019ve now seen is sort of in our book of business, and I think you see it more broadly in the market, that differentiation in margins between first-time move-up and active adult for us, pretty consistent in the most recent quarter with what I would characterize as the norm from several years ago, obviously, still very strong margins. You can see it both in our results and in our guide. So as you go forward, you heard Ryan say about 40% of our business is targeted at that entry level. That\u2019s a little bit richer than it was 4, 5 years ago for us. That was conscious on our part. And so if you think about mix adjusted over time, we will see a little bit more contribution from a margin perspective, worthing to always highlight we don\u2019t underwrite the margin. We are focused on return. And you made the point, I agree with you. That\u2019s a business that typically spins a little faster. So we\u2019re able to get the returns out of that business by virtue of that velocity coupled with the margins that we\u2019re able to generate.\nAlan Ratner: Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks a lot, guys.\nPablo Shaughnessy: Thanks, Alan.\nOperator: We will go next to Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Thanks very much, guys. Yes, lots of interesting stuff here, encouraging news. Let me \u2013 let\u2019s start with the \u2013 with your orders. I\u2019m kind of curious as to whether or not we whether you think that absorptions per community over the course of the next year or so, can be higher than the roughly $2.4 billion per month over the course of the year that you did pre-pandemic. And you talked about a production capacity of $27 to 28,000, up from what you said last time. But I\u2019m curious, does this assume any continued improvement in cycle times or is this literally if things just stayed exactly the way they are right now?\nRyan Marshall: So Stephen, let me start with absorptions per community. Going back over the last several quarters, you\u2019ve heard me talk about, we\u2019re not going to be margin proud and that we are going to work and take market share and turn our assets. And I think you\u2019ve seen us do that. I highlighted in my prepared remarks today, that we\u2019re very pleased with the absorptions that we turned out \u2013 the absorbent for a community that we turned out of the first quarter. And we were able to do it at outstanding margins as well. So I think we were successful on both fronts there. Going forward, we are going to continue to follow that same approach. We think it\u2019s really important to continue to turn the assets and to continue to have high \u2013 reasonably high absorptions per community. And we will combine that with what has been historically best-in-class margin profile. And so we think we\u2019ve got a lot of the elements of our playbook and our strategy working well. In terms of the second part of your question, remind \u2013 cycle times. So Stephen, for our total year delivery, what we\u2019ve highlighted is that we\u2019ve got a production universe in process with \u2013 what\u2019s in process and what we expect to start, it will give us a universe that will allow us to potentially close up to 27,000 to 28,000 homes. We have assumed the cycle times that we are currently seeing. So we have not incorporated any improvement. We have seen improvement, and we\u2019ve incorporated that. We haven\u2019t incorporated further improvement. And certainly, we\u2019ve got lofty goals that we\u2019re endeavoring to claw back even more cycle time, but that\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work by our teams and our trades and suppliers.\nStephen Kim: Great. And if I could sort of just follow-up on that last point, that production capacity of $27,000 to $28,000 is an encouraging number, obviously. And yet, your starts this quarter were a little on the lighter side relative to what we had been thinking. And certainly much lower than what you\u2019re expecting to close next quarter. So can you talk a little bit about why the start number was kind of where it was? And what gives you confidence that, that number can rise from here? That would be very helpful. Thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, it\u2019s a multi-month kind of program that we look at in terms of the \u2013 our starts cadence and what we put into the ground I think it\u2019s widely well known that the first 3 months of the quarter tend to be more difficult on the weather side, especially for our businesses in the Midwest and the Northeast. So probably a little bit of an impact on the number being a tad lower, but our forward plans in terms of our starts cadence, that\u2019s all wrapped up into the 27,000 to 28,000 unit range kind of production guide. So I\u2019d probably look at everything in its entirety, not just what we started in Q1, but what was in backlog, what was in production, what we started in Q1, plus the kind of implied Q2 start rate. I think that all that all works into the way that we\u2019re running the business.\nStephen Kim: Okay. So I\u2019m hearing there that you expect 2Q starts to increase. I don\u2019t remember \u2013 Bob, did you actually give a starts forecast for 2Q, because that would be helpful if you had it?\nRyan Marshall: That\u2019s not a number we provided, Stephen.\nStephen Kim: Okay. Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Okay, thanks, guys.\nOperator: We will go next to Anthony Pettinari at Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning. Cancellation rate came down pretty sharply quarter-over-quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, was there a particular month where that step down was most significant or was it pretty smooth throughout the quarter? Just wondering if the kind of normalization in cancellation rates is maybe more of a change in overall biopsychology or maybe just reflects kind of the backlog working itself through, any thoughts there?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. There wasn\u2019t \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a cliff. It was a pretty consistent cadence. And I think your point is a good one. The consumer has I think, largely now oriented themselves around the stability and rates that Brian talked about, they are moving, but they are not moving anywhere near as much as they were in the back half of last year. Couple that with the fact that most of the backlog and folks that signed contracts back when rates were much lower and got to a much higher rate at the closing table and the kind of the shock and cancellation impact from that has largely worked through the system. So I think the combination of those two things has the current contracted customer base and people signing contracts today are less sensitive to those rate movements than we saw in the back half of this year. And I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the can rates. And candidly, the reason we provided it, we had less total cancellations in the first quarter than we did in the fourth, I think for all those reasons.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just from a big picture perspective, when you look at the quarter and think about the drivers of your gross margin beat versus your expectations. Was it primarily stronger pricing or executing on the cost side, maybe without cutting it too finally, I\u2019m just wondering what sort of surprised you the most around the quarter?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes, I\u2019d like to tell you it\u2019s cost, but it really wasn\u2019t. I mean that was for the stuff that we closed in the quarter, those costs were baked in. We\u2019re working with our trades to find efficiencies going forward. Lumber was obviously a benefit, but we knew that. So that was in our guide. I think it really \u2013 and we highlighted this in our remarks, it was reflective of the sales environment. It was the relatively strong demand. It was our ability to manage our incentive load. So we\u2019ve had a national mortgage rate buydown program in effect since the beginning of the year. And what we\u2019ve been able to do is use that as another selling tool. And so for some people, it\u2019s, hey, get my rate as low as you can get it. For others, I want my rate down a little bit, and I want you to help you with closing costs. The nice part is that, that incentive replaced the incentives that we were offering before as opposed to added to it. And then you couple that with the fact that we highlighted that we were able to stop reducing prices and actually started to increase prices in more than half of our communities. Now these aren\u2019t massive increases, but it\u2019s the psychology of sales that relative strength was better than we had forecast in our guide for the quarter and showed up in the margin for the quarter.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I will turn it over.\nPablo Shaughnessy: Thanks, Anthony.\nOperator: We will move next to Michael Rehaut at JPMorgan.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I just wanted to zero in a little bit, if possible, on the pricing trends. As you mentioned before, you said that you had increased prices maybe in about 50% of your markets. Just wanted to get a sense between the reduction or moderation in incentives that you\u2019ve seen so far year-to-date as well as maybe between that and some of the base price increases. If you could give us a sense of how much pricing \u2013 net pricing has improved from 4Q end to 1Q end?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, we haven\u2019t given that level of granularity. I think the previous question that Bob just answered really highlighted what we\u2019ve seen, which has been a build of kind of sales momentum if you remember going back to November, December of last year. The market was still pretty tough, but we did comment on our year-end report that we had in January that we are starting to see some momentum building in the back half of January or December and into January, we\u2019ve seen that continue, and that\u2019s allowed us to pull back on incentives. It\u2019s allowed us to take some very moderate price increases, but it\u2019s definitely a change in kind of the sentiment that we\u2019re seeing from buyers. I think some of that is interest rates stabilizing. I think some of that is the interest rate incentives that we have done, I think a lot of that is kind of buyer psychology. And then the biggest thing as I go back to, we\u2019ve got a housing shortage in this country, and that hasn\u2019t changed. And so in the places where we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate value, which we\u2019ve worked very hard to do, we\u2019re seeing some nice momentum on the sales floor. And I think you\u2019ve heard from us, we\u2019ve seen that continue into April. And that\u2019s allowed us to be optimistic and bullish with our forward start projections and some of the things that we\u2019re anticipating to be able to do for the balance of the year.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. I appreciate that, Ryan. I guess secondly, looking at the gross margins for the second quarter, you\u2019re expecting about 100 to 150 bps of potential contraction, just wanted to get a sense of if that is just due to the lagged impact of higher incentives from the back half of last year. And if that \u2013 because I believe you also mentioned that \u2013 if I heard right, and apologies, if I didn\u2019t, but that you are also going to see the benefit of lower lumber costs in the second quarter. But if the driver is that lagged impact of higher incentives from back half of \u201822, do you feel that that\u2019s mostly \u2013 will have mostly played itself out by the second quarter, or could there be incremental negative impact in the back half of \u201823?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Well, we haven\u2019t given a guide beyond Q2. And there is a lot of moving parts in the market. The reason I mentioned that we are only going to go out one quarter, we have got lumber. It\u2019s ticking up again. That will be later in the year or into next year. It\u2019s worth that while looking at the cost environment, we still see inflation. We think that it\u2019s a little bit lower in rate than we probably projected at the beginning of the year, but we are still feeling cost increases and labor in particular is pretty sticky. We have talked about that. And obviously, if you look at the production cycle, our land is typically more expensive as we move through time. So, we have got incremental cost against a relatively flat at some points during the last two quarters, decreasing pricing. So, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s actually resulting in the margin decline year-over-year. The strength in the market that we saw last year produced largest we had never seen before, Mike. And this is just a reflection of the reality that costs are up, and we haven\u2019t been able to offset all of those to-date.\nMichael Rehaut: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley at Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just thinking about kind of the strength of sales pace during the quarter, kind of look back on the quarter, obviously there was a period where mortgage rates reached over 7% again. We had the sort of regional banking crisis where perhaps there was some impact on housing activity for a few weeks. I am curious from Pulte\u2019s perspective, did you see kind of impacts to your own sales pace during those periods, any kind of color on sort of the cadence through the quarter? And as we have kind of moved past that, how is sales pace trending to sort of exit March and into April relative to some of those uncertain periods during the quarter? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Matt, what we saw in the quarter was a strengthening of sales pace as we move January to February, February to March. Sequentially, sales paces got stronger. And then we have seen April continue to the first 3.5 weeks, three weeks of April continue to perform at a really strong level. So, we are pleased with what we are seeing. To your point, I think in certain markets, particularly on the West Coast during the banking, regional banking crisis, I think certain buyer groups in certain cities were probably more impacted psychologically than others. I think most of the things that we were seeing resulting from that have dissipated and we are continuing to see good momentum on the sales force.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Thank you for that. And then secondly, you mentioned at the top, some eventual opportunities to sort of put your liquidity to work if credit constraints with smaller builders amount. I guess I am curious how that might take shape from your perspective, kind of what are you seeing and hearing on the ground today from a competitive perspective versus these smaller builders?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Nothing necessarily on the ground yet, Matt. I think we are more being responsive to some of the things that have been widely written about and talked about that the smaller banks that provide operating lines and project-specific financing, that credit has gotten tighter. We are not in a position where we use project-specific financing. We are self-funded for almost everything that we do, and we have the ability to given our size to tap into the public capital markets, if so needed. So, I think when it comes to land development, land acquisition, the desire or the decision to put more spec into the ground, we have got tremendous flexibility because of the way that we are capitalized. And I do think that could potentially give us the opportunity to take advantage of any kind of dislocation that might appear. It\u2019s an always-on mindset, which we have always had, not trying to send any kind of a message there other than there was a banking crisis, credit has gotten tighter, and we have got our ears open to any opportunities that that might create for us.\nMatthew Bouley: Got it. Thanks Ryan. Good luck guys.\nOperator: And we will move next to Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Dahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the land dynamics and market [ph] dynamics, you did raise your land spend on the top end is up quite a bit versus last quarter. So, I wanted to just ask, is that incorporating any potential flex in acquisition spend and as you look to take advantage of potential disruptions later this year, or is that more of kind of a core something changed, either more deals kind of penciling that you thought you would walk away from or something else going on with either development or acq spend that you care to highlight in terms of that increase in the forecast spend?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. Fair question. That is just our projection of what we see on the ground. And so the increase in absorptions that we have seen, the relative stability in pricing gives us a little bit more confidence as we are looking at some of the deal flow that we \u2013 for land transactions, it does not anticipate or incorporate any M&A or anything of that sort that would happen separate from that, and we would evaluate it. But we haven\u2019t projected that in the overall increase.\nMike Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thanks Bob. And then my follow-up, you called out the order trends by buyer segment, which was pretty interesting. Could you help us understand maybe the community count or absorption by our segment first time move up active adult? I think you said that the total was maybe up 18% in first time, but then down in the 20s on the other two segments.\nPablo Shaughnessy: We haven\u2019t given that level of detail in a while. I think from a community count perspective, you have heard us say, we are investing in the entry level. So, our \u2013 a lot of the growth that you saw, we had growth across all three buyer segments in our community count. It was more oriented towards the first time. And interestingly, then next to the move-up and the active adult is those are bigger positions, so they don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have quite as much flexibility in those over time. But the 13% was spread across all, but it was largely in the first time.\nMike Dahl: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: We will move next to Susan Maklari at Goldman Sachs.\nSusan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning everyone. First question is talking a bit about the SG&A. You mentioned that you are cautiously adding some headcount there. Can you just give some sense of how that\u2019s trending? And where do you expect that, that can go over time as you think about the level of deliveries you are targeting?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Susan, I think Bob highlighted in his prepared remarks, just with the increased potential for production in the year. We have raised our production potential by 2,000 to 3,000. So, we have added sales and construction headcount in the right locations that matches up where we have been able to kind of turn up the volume there just a little bit. We will \u2013 I think Bob highlighted, we will continue to maintain SG&A leverage as a percentage of revenue, so no hidden message there, nor should there be an expectation that you would see dilution to our leverage rates.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. And you increased the authorization on the buybacks this quarter as well. Can you talk a bit about your appetite to buyback the stock here? And any thoughts on how you are thinking of the cadence of that going forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. We don\u2019t provide forward guidance, Susan. But in terms of appetite, I think the increased authorization, which we are very pleased our Board made the decision to increase the authorization by $1 billion. I think it shows that we have got a continued appetite for this to be a part of our capital allocation philosophy, which has been a consistent part for going on nearly 10 years. So, if consistency is a virtue, if it\u2019s not, we should make consistency of virtue, I think we are demonstrating that we are living up to the capital allocation philosophy that we have articulated for our shareholders.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thank you and good luck.\nOperator: We will go next to Dan Oppenheim at Credit Suisse.\nDan Oppenheim: Hi. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can just talk about the West where you talked about some of the tougher conditions, how are you thinking about spec at higher price points and where it\u2019s more challenging? Are you doing \u2013 do you have much less in terms of spec per community in the West than you have in other regions? I am just curious how you are handling that?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Dan, in terms of the West, for us, it encompasses the coastal markets, California and Seattle, but also includes Las Vegas, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico. So, there is a mix of different cities and geographies and product types in the West. When we get into the coastal markets, we build a lot of multifamily three and four-story product. And so those buildings actually generally start as spec just by the nature. So, there is spec there and there is not anything that we are necessarily concerned about. We have \u2013 I would highlight in the West, we have seen some strengthening in Las Vegas and particularly \u2013 and Phoenix over the last two months to three months, we have actually started to see those markets firm up and start to get back on to some pretty positive sales trends and positive footing. So, the two places that we are continuing to kind of pay attention to Northern California and Seattle, those are markets that I think are pretty tech-heavy. The price points are generally higher. Affordability is more challenged. Also a couple of the areas that are probably more directly impacted by some of the regional bank crisis, so \u2013 but on the whole, we are still very optimistic about the way our West business is positioned just relative to Texas, the Southeast and Florida, those markets have done exceptionally well.\nDan Oppenheim: Sure. It makes sense. And I guess you talked about cycle times coming down. How much \u2013 if we think about the conversion, how much would you say is driven by some improvement in cycle times versus just the specs and the shorter time from contract to closing on those specs?\nRyan Marshall: Well, Dan, the way we are really looking at is, we are looking at it from start to final. And certainly, we pay attention to overall cycle time from start to close which has improved by a quicker flow-through on the spec side. But when we talk about cycle time, it\u2019s separate and independent from anything related to a buyer. It\u2019s purely within how long does it take us to build a home, and that\u2019s where we are starting to see some gains being made, particularly on the front end. So, for homes that are going into the ground now we measure it from slab to kind of frame as an example, frank stage. We are starting to see some pretty meaningful gains out of that front end of construction. The back end of the homes that are finishing now, they are still \u2013 those homes are still on longer cycle times, but we would expect to extend the gains that we were recognizing currently on the front end. As those homes get into the back end trades, we would expect to pick up time there as well.\nDan Oppenheim: Great. Yes. I was thinking about in terms of the backlog conversion from those two issues. Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Next, we will move to Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research.\nTruman Patterson: Thanks for taking my questions. First on the entry-level orders, I believe you all said were up like 18% year-over-year. That\u2019s quite a bit stronger than where we think underlying entry-level spec demand is. Could you help us understand that a little bit? Is it easier comps, community location? Have you all early in 1Q \u2013 did you bring incentives more in line with the market, etcetera, just trying to understand that result a little bit better. And then could you help us understand just where overall absorption stood exiting the quarter in March?\nPablo Shaughnessy: I was going to say it\u2019s hard to react to that. I think what we have seen reflected in our results is that we started fair number of homes that were speculative last year. They were available, and we have been able to sell them. We \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a huge incentive. I have mentioned earlier, we have a national rate buy-down, and it is probably most appealing to that buyer group. But it probably is only a relatively small percentage of our total population of signups that actually took that. They may have other things that are more important to some buyers.\nRyan Marshall: The one thing Truman, that I think I would probably highlight is that our entry-level product tends to be on the higher side of the price \u2013 the entry level price band, the locations are excellent. And so I think we have got a well-located product that\u2019s still within the affordable range that appeals to a first-time entry level buyer. And so if our performance exceeds maybe kind of what you are expecting, my guess is on a relative basis, that\u2019s probably some of the strength as we have got excellent locations for those entry-level communities. And then as far as kind of the exit rate for the quarter, that\u2019s not a number that we have quoted. I did highlight though on one of the previous questions, we saw absorption strength progress as we move through the quarter. So, March was our highest sales and the highest absorption rate of the quarter. We have seen strength continue as we have moved into April.\nTruman Patterson: Perfect. Thanks guys. And then can you provide an update on the strategic relationship with Invitation? I am just wondering if that might have been pushed back a little bit in the current environment with higher rates and higher cap rates.\nRyan Marshall: Yes. We are very happy with the relationship that we have with Invitation. And I would probably answer the question more broadly about single-family rental. We have made it a small part of our overall production environment. We are looking at opportunities where we can provide a very, very small number of our total deliveries to the build-for-rent operators, Invitation being a big part of that. So, we are happy with how it\u2019s performing. We talked about it being something in the range once we get to full capacity of about 5% of our annual deliveries. We are still on track as we get this ramped up that that\u2019s about what it will be, and we are pretty comfortable with that.\nTruman Patterson: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments on the tighter credit. Can you talk about the potential impact to your land developers? Are you seeing any stress out there? And could that have any impact on your ability to option, or would you have to support your partners or take on more lots for yourself?\nPablo Shaughnessy: Yes. Candidly, no, most of the folks that we work with are pretty well capitalized. They are big developers in their market. And the truth is that we self-develop a great deal of the land that we control anyway. We are not \u2013 the vast majority of our business is actually self-funded. So \u2013 but for those deals where we have got partners, they are typically pretty well capitalized.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned earlier that the improving sales environment contributed to the gross margin upside versus your expectation, was the stronger sales improving traffic or better conversion or like a combination of both? Any color you can give on sort of quantifying which one of those drove upside to your initial expectation?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Traffic, I think was pretty consistent with what we expected. Conversion was better and the incentives that we had to provide to get that conversion were better than our expectations, which is what really contributed to the margin outperformance.\nRafe Jadrosich: Alright. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Jim for any closing remarks.\nJim Zeumer: I appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We are certainly available for the remainder of the day for any follow-up questions. Otherwise, we look forward to meeting with you in the next quarter.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim and good morning. Based on the improving demand dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, we were cautiously optimistic heading into 2023. I am extremely pleased to report that the market momentum that began building in Q4 continued to expand into the first quarter of 2023. Today's stronger market conditions, combined with actions implemented by our outstanding field teams to enhance our competitive position helped drive our first \u2013 strong first quarter results that included a 15% growth in home sale revenues, a 100 basis point increase in operating margin and a 28% increase in earnings per share. Among the actions we have taken has been to increase our production of spec homes, a strategy we began implementing in the back half of 2022. As discussed on previous earnings calls, we made the decision to increase spec starts as we saw the opportunity to realize a number of strategic benefits within our homebuilding operations. With more units in production, we can better meet buyer demand as more consumers are seeking quick move-in homes as a hedge against rising mortgage rates. By maintaining the level of spec starts, we can commit to a more consistent start cadence. This is particularly valuable in today's environment when negotiating with our trades and suppliers. Keeping units in production allows us to turn assets more efficiently which is critical to delivering high returns over the housing cycle. The importance of having an appropriate inventory of spec homes available can be seen in our first quarter sign-ups, which on a gross basis increased 1% over last year to 8,900 homes. Of these sign-ups, almost 60% were spec sales, so the decision to increase spec starts was the right one. That said I want to be clear that our strategy is to keep starts directionally in alignment with market demand. We believe this balanced approach is consistent with both these historic business practices and allows us to turn our assets while maintaining a better margin profile. Our first quarter results show that we are successfully executing against this strategy as we realized strong sales while still delivering exceptional gross margins of 29.1%. You have heard me say that we won't be margin proud, but we also won't sacrifice profits if we don't have to. By being more measured in our starts cadence, we can meet buyer demand while not oversupplying the market. Case in point, we ended the first quarter with 1,500 fewer specs in production than we started the quarter. This gives us flexibility to maintain or increase production volumes, which in today's market is an important lever when working with trades and suppliers. As it relates to overall housing demand, home sales are benefiting from recent declines in mortgage rates, but I also think just having a general sense of stability in rates is important to consumer confidence. Given improvements in demand conditions in the broader interest rate environment as well as a generally limited inventory of existing homes, we are starting to see the pressure on selling prices ease in many of our markets. In fact, and well over half of our markets, we have found opportunities to pull back on incentives and/or move prices higher in many of our communities. While the price changes are modest, it demonstrates the point that people desire home ownership and are willing to buy when they see value. Earlier this month, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that looked at the housing shortage in this country. The article raised the point that depending upon which expert you ask, the housing shortage ranges from 2 million to 7 million houses. While there are certainly debates about the number, I think there is broad agreement that we have a housing shortage. I believe this is one of the reasons homebuyers are quick to respond when affordability pressures can be eased. Before turning the call over to Bob, let me take a minute to address impacts on credit availability given recent disruptions in the banking industry, particularly among the regional banks. The short answer is that we have not experienced any disruptions. On the mortgage side, we are advantaged by having a captive financial services operation that routinely originates mortgages for between 75% to 80% of Pulte homebuyers that require financing. On the project side, big builders such as PulteGroup, self-fund or have access to capital that smaller builders typically cannot match. In the end, it maybe that recent disturbances in the banking sector may create opportunities for PulteGroup to put its more than $2 billion in total liquidity to work. I am very proud of our team as PulteGroup delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter. I am also highly encouraged by the improving demand conditions we have been experiencing over the past two quarters. And I would add that buyer demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of April. While we have and will continue to take steps to best position PulteGroup for success within today's changing market dynamics, we remain measured and disciplined in our actions. From production rates and land spends to overheads and share repurchases, we remain focused on delivering performance over the long-term. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter. Thanks, Bob. I think there are a lot of positives to be taken out of our first quarter results, including we delivered record first quarter earnings, driven by higher closings, continued strong gross margins and improved overhead leverage. Overall market conditions continue to improve as we experienced strong demands and are finding opportunities to reduce incentives and/or increase prices in many communities. Supply chain conditions are stabilizing, and we have seen at least an initial turn towards shorter cycle times. At this point, the gains have been market-specific but we are optimistic that we've seen a high watermark in terms of construction cycle times. Our national and local teams are making strides and climb back construction days, which is critical because shortening our cycle time is an important driver to expanding our 2023 production universe. PulteGroup's Board approved another $1 billion increase due to the company's share repurchase authorization. We've bought over \u2013 we have bought back over 40% of our shares and clearly remain committed to the systemic return of bonds to our shareholders. One other positive I would highlight is that PulteGroup was once again ranked among the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for. This is our third year on this prestigious list and we again moved higher, climbing from number 43 last year to number 36 in the most recent ranking. We take fry and being included on this list because it is based on what our employees say about their experience as part of the PulteGroup team. Our success in delivering quality homes and delighting our customers starts and ends with our 6,100 employees dedicated to doing the right thing, taking care of our customers, focusing on quality and lifting the teammates around them. The amazing culture resident of PulteGroup doesn't happen by chance, but rather it comes from a committed effort by every employee to create a world-class culture. I am extremely proud of our team and I want to thank all of our employees, along with our trade partners and suppliers for their tremendous work in helping to deliver another outstanding quarter of operating and financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Yes. Sure, John. We're seeing continued strength in the Florida markets, the Southeast markets in Texas would be the three kind of regions that I would highlight with strength. Our Midwest business continues to be a steady performer. And then in terms of markets that are more challenging, it would really be the western markets, particularly the ones in the \u2013 the high-priced coastal areas Northern California and Seattle, probably being the two that I would highlight. Yes, John, I think we've demonstrated exactly that. And I think it shows that when we started really talking about this middle of last year, that specifically with the first-time entry-level business, there was an opportunity to have more homes that were sooner deliveries, which help to alleviate \u2013 it really helped to alleviate pressure around interest rate, rising interest rates. It helped to alleviate pressure around certainty of when things we're going to deliver and we made the strategic decision to put more spec in the ground. To your point, we've historically not been a spec builder, but it's never been a 0% of our business. We've always had specs as part of our business, but we made the decision to make it a bigger piece. It got as much as high as about 45% of our total work in process inventory with spec. And I highlight that number, John, because that matches up pretty well with our Centex business, which is about 40% of our overall business, which is catered towards the entry-level first-time buyer. So in terms of where it goes in the future, we're going to continue to \u2013 as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, match our spec production with what we think the market demand is. And right now, that's certainly higher spec production than maybe what we've historically done. It's working for us. And I think this most recent quarter's results are a great example of how that strategy is working. Yes, Alan, it's a good question. I would tell you, broadly, we saw strength in all price points. That being said, there is a higher likelihood of the entry-level buyer transacting at this point in time because they don't have a home to sell. And so they are not hampered by the low interest rate that they may be hanging on to with their existing home. But look, as we've talked in prior calls, life continues to happen for buyers, marriages, more kids, relocations, job promotions all the things that I think create a need for a family and a potential buyer to move into a different home for whatever reason, our move up in our active adult business, they are certainly benefiting from that as well. We are seeing easing of sales price pressure in both the move-up and the active adult segment, which is allowing us to moderately raise prices and moderately pull back on incentives. And I think that demonstrates some of the strength we're seeing. We intentionally don't build a lot of spec in those price points. We find the debt buyer group. They prefer to have the build-to-order model. But when it comes to our entry-level first-time SendTech business, we're leaning in more with the spec first strategy, and it's working for us. So Stephen, let me start with absorptions per community. Going back over the last several quarters, you've heard me talk about, we're not going to be margin proud and that we are going to work and take market share and turn our assets. And I think you've seen us do that. I highlighted in my prepared remarks today, that we're very pleased with the absorptions that we turned out \u2013 the absorbent for a community that we turned out of the first quarter. And we were able to do it at outstanding margins as well. So I think we were successful on both fronts there. Going forward, we are going to continue to follow that same approach. We think it's really important to continue to turn the assets and to continue to have high \u2013 reasonably high absorptions per community. And we will combine that with what has been historically best-in-class margin profile. And so we think we've got a lot of the elements of our playbook and our strategy working well. In terms of the second part of your question, remind \u2013 cycle times. So Stephen, for our total year delivery, what we've highlighted is that we've got a production universe in process with \u2013 what's in process and what we expect to start, it will give us a universe that will allow us to potentially close up to 27,000 to 28,000 homes. We have assumed the cycle times that we are currently seeing. So we have not incorporated any improvement. We have seen improvement, and we've incorporated that. We haven't incorporated further improvement. And certainly, we've got lofty goals that we're endeavoring to claw back even more cycle time, but that's going to take a lot of hard work by our teams and our trades and suppliers. Yes, Stephen, it's a multi-month kind of program that we look at in terms of the \u2013 our starts cadence and what we put into the ground I think it's widely well known that the first 3 months of the quarter tend to be more difficult on the weather side, especially for our businesses in the Midwest and the Northeast. So probably a little bit of an impact on the number being a tad lower, but our forward plans in terms of our starts cadence, that's all wrapped up into the 27,000 to 28,000 unit range kind of production guide. So I'd probably look at everything in its entirety, not just what we started in Q1, but what was in backlog, what was in production, what we started in Q1, plus the kind of implied Q2 start rate. I think that all that all works into the way that we're running the business. That's not a number we provided, Stephen. Yes, Mike, we haven't given that level of granularity. I think the previous question that Bob just answered really highlighted what we've seen, which has been a build of kind of sales momentum if you remember going back to November, December of last year. The market was still pretty tough, but we did comment on our year-end report that we had in January that we are starting to see some momentum building in the back half of January or December and into January, we've seen that continue, and that's allowed us to pull back on incentives. It's allowed us to take some very moderate price increases, but it's definitely a change in kind of the sentiment that we're seeing from buyers. I think some of that is interest rates stabilizing. I think some of that is the interest rate incentives that we have done, I think a lot of that is kind of buyer psychology. And then the biggest thing as I go back to, we've got a housing shortage in this country, and that hasn't changed. And so in the places where we've been able to demonstrate value, which we've worked very hard to do, we're seeing some nice momentum on the sales floor. And I think you've heard from us, we've seen that continue into April. And that's allowed us to be optimistic and bullish with our forward start projections and some of the things that we're anticipating to be able to do for the balance of the year. Thanks Mike. Yes. Matt, what we saw in the quarter was a strengthening of sales pace as we move January to February, February to March. Sequentially, sales paces got stronger. And then we have seen April continue to the first 3.5 weeks, three weeks of April continue to perform at a really strong level. So, we are pleased with what we are seeing. To your point, I think in certain markets, particularly on the West Coast during the banking, regional banking crisis, I think certain buyer groups in certain cities were probably more impacted psychologically than others. I think most of the things that we were seeing resulting from that have dissipated and we are continuing to see good momentum on the sales force. Yes. Nothing necessarily on the ground yet, Matt. I think we are more being responsive to some of the things that have been widely written about and talked about that the smaller banks that provide operating lines and project-specific financing, that credit has gotten tighter. We are not in a position where we use project-specific financing. We are self-funded for almost everything that we do, and we have the ability to given our size to tap into the public capital markets, if so needed. So, I think when it comes to land development, land acquisition, the desire or the decision to put more spec into the ground, we have got tremendous flexibility because of the way that we are capitalized. And I do think that could potentially give us the opportunity to take advantage of any kind of dislocation that might appear. It's an always-on mindset, which we have always had, not trying to send any kind of a message there other than there was a banking crisis, credit has gotten tighter, and we have got our ears open to any opportunities that that might create for us. Thanks Mike. Yes. Susan, I think Bob highlighted in his prepared remarks, just with the increased potential for production in the year. We have raised our production potential by 2,000 to 3,000. So, we have added sales and construction headcount in the right locations that matches up where we have been able to kind of turn up the volume there just a little bit. We will \u2013 I think Bob highlighted, we will continue to maintain SG&A leverage as a percentage of revenue, so no hidden message there, nor should there be an expectation that you would see dilution to our leverage rates. Yes. We don't provide forward guidance, Susan. But in terms of appetite, I think the increased authorization, which we are very pleased our Board made the decision to increase the authorization by $1 billion. I think it shows that we have got a continued appetite for this to be a part of our capital allocation philosophy, which has been a consistent part for going on nearly 10 years. So, if consistency is a virtue, if it's not, we should make consistency of virtue, I think we are demonstrating that we are living up to the capital allocation philosophy that we have articulated for our shareholders. Yes. Dan, in terms of the West, for us, it encompasses the coastal markets, California and Seattle, but also includes Las Vegas, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico. So, there is a mix of different cities and geographies and product types in the West. When we get into the coastal markets, we build a lot of multifamily three and four-story product. And so those buildings actually generally start as spec just by the nature. So, there is spec there and there is not anything that we are necessarily concerned about. We have \u2013 I would highlight in the West, we have seen some strengthening in Las Vegas and particularly \u2013 and Phoenix over the last two months to three months, we have actually started to see those markets firm up and start to get back on to some pretty positive sales trends and positive footing. So, the two places that we are continuing to kind of pay attention to Northern California and Seattle, those are markets that I think are pretty tech-heavy. The price points are generally higher. Affordability is more challenged. Also a couple of the areas that are probably more directly impacted by some of the regional bank crisis, so \u2013 but on the whole, we are still very optimistic about the way our West business is positioned just relative to Texas, the Southeast and Florida, those markets have done exceptionally well. Well, Dan, the way we are really looking at is, we are looking at it from start to final. And certainly, we pay attention to overall cycle time from start to close which has improved by a quicker flow-through on the spec side. But when we talk about cycle time, it's separate and independent from anything related to a buyer. It's purely within how long does it take us to build a home, and that's where we are starting to see some gains being made, particularly on the front end. So, for homes that are going into the ground now we measure it from slab to kind of frame as an example, frank stage. We are starting to see some pretty meaningful gains out of that front end of construction. The back end of the homes that are finishing now, they are still \u2013 those homes are still on longer cycle times, but we would expect to extend the gains that we were recognizing currently on the front end. As those homes get into the back end trades, we would expect to pick up time there as well. The one thing Truman, that I think I would probably highlight is that our entry-level product tends to be on the higher side of the price \u2013 the entry level price band, the locations are excellent. And so I think we have got a well-located product that's still within the affordable range that appeals to a first-time entry level buyer.

And then as far as kind of the exit rate for the quarter, that's not a number that we have quoted. I did highlight though on one of the previous questions, we saw absorption strength progress as we move through the quarter. So, March was our highest sales and the highest absorption rate of the quarter. We have seen strength continue as we have moved into April. Yes. We are very happy with the relationship that we have with Invitation. And I would probably answer the question more broadly about single-family rental. We have made it a small part of our overall production environment. We are looking at opportunities where we can provide a very, very small number of our total deliveries to the build-for-rent operators, Invitation being a big part of that.

We are still on track as we get this ramped up that that's about what it will be, and we are pretty comfortable with that. Yes. Traffic, I think was pretty consistent with what we expected. Conversion was better and the incentives that we had to provide to get that conversion were better than our expectations, which is what really contributed to the margin outperformance."

            "name": "Pablo Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan and good morning. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we have reclassified closing cost incentives from cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. The total incentive reclassified amounts is $81 million in the first quarter of this year and $38 million in the first quarter of last year. This reclassification impacted our reported home sales revenue and associated average sales prices as well as our reported home sale gross margin and SG&A percentages. An analysis of the impact of this reclassification in the current quarter and prior year periods is included in today's webcast slides. Where appropriate, any numbers referenced in my comments, current, past or future are inclusive of this reclass. Let me now get started with a review of our first quarter results. Home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 15% over the prior year to a first quarter record of $3.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect a 6% increase in closings to 6,394 homes and a 9% increase in average sales price to $545,000. On a year-over-year basis, we realized higher average sales prices across all buyer groups, led by double-digit gains in both move-up and active adult. In the quarter, we reported 6,394 closings, which represents a 6% increase over the comparable prior year period. Our closings for the quarter came in above our guide as we capitalized on stronger demand for spec homes, an improvement in select areas of our supply chain that allowed us to close additional homes in the period. I'd like to take a moment to thank our procurement and construction teams working in partnership with our trades and suppliers for their contributions over the last several quarters. Their efforts during a time of extraordinary market volatility were instrumental to the operating success we have achieved. Looking at the mix of our closings in the quarter, our results included 39% from first-time buyers, 35% for move-up buyers and 26% from active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the closing mix was 34% first-time, 40% move-up and 26% active adult. The higher percentage of closings from first-time buyers reflects our increased investment in that part of our business over the last several years as well as an increase in the availability of spec homes in our first-time communities, resulting from our decision to increase spec production to the back half of 2022. Looking at our orders in the quarter, our net new orders totaled 7,354 homes, which is down 8% from the prior year. Our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog was 13% in the first quarter, which is up from 4% last year. On a sequential basis, the 13% cancellation rate is up less than 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. So cancellations are beginning to stabilize. In fact, on a unit basis, cancellations in this quarter amounted to 1,544 homes, which is down sequentially from 1,871 homes in the fourth quarter. By buyer group, net new orders to first-time buyers increased 18% over the prior year to 3,177 homes, while move-up orders decreased by 20% to 2,645 homes, and active adult orders were lower by 22% to 1,532 homes. Our average community count in the first quarter increased 13% over last year to $879. Based on the communities opened in the period, our absorption pace of 2.8 homes per month was down from the prior year, but in line with our pre-pandemic sales rate, which averaged 2.7 for the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020. Based on land investments we made in prior years, we expect to operate out of approximately 900 communities in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of 14% over the second quarter of last year. Looking over the balance of the year, we continue to expect community count growth of 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. Given our expanding community count, PulteGroup is well positioned to increase its market share within the improving demand environment. We ended the first quarter with a backlog of 13,129 homes with a value of $8 billion. This compares with last year's Q1 record backlog of 19,935 homes valued at $11.5 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 16,872 homes under construction, of which 15% were finished. Spec units represented 38% of our production, which is up from last year and consistent with our strategy to have specs available to meet buyer demand for homes that can close sooner. Over the course of the first quarter, we started production on approximately 5,200 homes. This start rate was down about 40% from the first quarter of last year, but up on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to drive an appropriate start cadence as we focus on turning our assets. Based on the roughly 17,000 homes we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to deliver between 7,000 and 7,400 homes in the second quarter. Given the ongoing improvement in the overall operating environment, we are pleased by the level of production we have been able to realize, thanks to the efforts of our outstanding operating teams. In addition to these higher unit volumes, we are also seeing the beginning stages of a shortening in our production cycle. At this point, depending upon the market, the gains range from just a few days to a few weeks, but the trends are generally positive. Based on our strong Q1 results and the potential for cycle times to gradually improve, the production potential of homes will have available to close in 2023 has increased to 27,000, 28,000 homes. This is up from our initial guide of 25,000 loans. Obviously, the strength of sign-ups in the second quarter will go a long way in determining how much of this production universe actually converts into 2023 closings. While the average sales price in our backlog is $608,000, we currently expect the average sales price to our second quarter closings to be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. That estimate reflects both the mix of homes scheduled to close as well as the impact of anticipated spec closings, which are primarily first-time homes that have a lower average sales price. We reported first quarter gross margins of 29.1% which was 20 basis points below last year. Please note that our reported gross margins in the first quarter benefited by approximately 70 basis points from the reclass of closing incentives and cost of sales to net revenue. The benefit to our first quarter 2022 gross margin was 40 basis points. I would highlight that in the current quarter, our margins benefited from our move-up and active adult business where pressures on our selling prices have been relatively less impactful compared with entry level homes. After several years of gross margin parity across buyer groups, we are seeing a reversion to the historic trend of higher margins in our move-up and active adult business. Based on the mix of homes we plan to close in the second quarter, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. As with our closings and reported margins in the first quarter, deliveries in the second quarter will reflect the benefit of lower lumber costs that are flowing through our operations. In the first quarter, we reported SG&A expense of $337 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our SG&A expense was $329 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Higher closings and associated revenues in this year's first quarter drove the improved overhead leverage relative to last year and our guide. With expected 2023 production volumes moving higher, we are carefully adding sales and construction staff, but still expect to maintain overhead leverage. As such, we expect second quarter SG&A to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5%. In the first quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $14 million, which is down from $41 million in the prior year. Pre-tax income in the period was impacted by lower loan volumes, competitive pricing dynamics and higher mortgage incentives being used throughout the industry. In Q1, our capture rate was 78% compared with 81% last year. Market conditions have clearly improved, but as we do under all market conditions, we continue to routinely reassess our own planned positions and pending land transactions. Based on this review process, in the first quarter, we walked away from 5,300 lots that were previously held under option and wrote off approximately $6 million in associated deposits and pre-acquisition costs. In the first quarter, our reported tax expense was $170 million or an effective tax rate of 24.2%. We expect our tax rate in the second quarter to be 24.5%. Our net income for the first quarter was $532 million or $2.35 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $455 million or $1.83 per share. In addition to significantly higher net income, our earnings per share benefited from the company's share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.8 billion common shares at a cost of $150 million or an average price of $54.30 per share. Consistent with our plans to continue returning excess funds to our shareholders, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available under the program to $1.2 billion. Along with returning funds to our shareholders, we continue to strategically invest in our business. In the first quarter, we invested $906 million of land acquisition and development, down from $1.1 billion in Q1 of last year. Given the stronger demand environment and the increase in our overall construction activities, we now expect to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in land acquisition development in 2023. We ended the period with 210,000 lots under control. This is consistent with year-end and down 10% from last year. Based on our activity over the past several quarters, 61% of those lots are owned and 49% are options. We will continue to seek increased optionality of our land bank with a target of up to 70% of our lots being controlled via option. Reflecting the strength of our first quarter financial results and associated cash flows, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, which lowered our net debt to capital ratio of 7.2%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 18.1%, down from 21.5% at the end of the first quarter last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Yes, Alan, it's Bob. We haven't given a guide. There is a lot of moving pieces out in the market. So we've got pretty good visibility based on our backlog and the sales activity we're seeing. The commentary was \u2013 if you think about the last several years, there is been sort of a compression in margins. And you saw it both in our results and our peers where some of the folks that were selling entry-level had higher margins than they historically would have \u2013 that was based on availability, pricing dynamics, a lot of different things. What we've now seen is sort of in our book of business, and I think you see it more broadly in the market, that differentiation in margins between first-time move-up and active adult for us, pretty consistent in the most recent quarter with what I would characterize as the norm from several years ago, obviously, still very strong margins. You can see it both in our results and in our guide. So as you go forward, you heard Ryan say about 40% of our business is targeted at that entry level. That's a little bit richer than it was 4, 5 years ago for us. That was conscious on our part. And so if you think about mix adjusted over time, we will see a little bit more contribution from a margin perspective, worthing to always highlight we don't underwrite the margin. We are focused on return. And you made the point, I agree with you. That's a business that typically spins a little faster. So we're able to get the returns out of that business by virtue of that velocity coupled with the margins that we're able to generate. Thanks, Alan. Yes. There wasn't \u2013 it wasn't a cliff. It was a pretty consistent cadence. And I think your point is a good one. The consumer has I think, largely now oriented themselves around the stability and rates that Brian talked about, they are moving, but they are not moving anywhere near as much as they were in the back half of last year. Couple that with the fact that most of the backlog and folks that signed contracts back when rates were much lower and got to a much higher rate at the closing table and the kind of the shock and cancellation impact from that has largely worked through the system. So I think the combination of those two things has the current contracted customer base and people signing contracts today are less sensitive to those rate movements than we saw in the back half of this year. And I think that's why you've seen the can rates. And candidly, the reason we provided it, we had less total cancellations in the first quarter than we did in the fourth, I think for all those reasons. Yes, I'd like to tell you it's cost, but it really wasn't. I mean that was for the stuff that we closed in the quarter, those costs were baked in. We're working with our trades to find efficiencies going forward. Lumber was obviously a benefit, but we knew that. So that was in our guide. I think it really \u2013 and we highlighted this in our remarks, it was reflective of the sales environment. It was the relatively strong demand. It was our ability to manage our incentive load. So we've had a national mortgage rate buydown program in effect since the beginning of the year. And what we've been able to do is use that as another selling tool. And so for some people, it's, hey, get my rate as low as you can get it. For others, I want my rate down a little bit, and I want you to help you with closing costs. The nice part is that, that incentive replaced the incentives that we were offering before as opposed to added to it. And then you couple that with the fact that we highlighted that we were able to stop reducing prices and actually started to increase prices in more than half of our communities. Now these aren't massive increases, but it's the psychology of sales that relative strength was better than we had forecast in our guide for the quarter and showed up in the margin for the quarter. Thanks, Anthony. Well, we haven't given a guide beyond Q2. And there is a lot of moving parts in the market. The reason I mentioned that we are only going to go out one quarter, we have got lumber. It's ticking up again. That will be later in the year or into next year. It's worth that while looking at the cost environment, we still see inflation. We think that it's a little bit lower in rate than we probably projected at the beginning of the year, but we are still feeling cost increases and labor in particular is pretty sticky. We have talked about that. And obviously, if you look at the production cycle, our land is typically more expensive as we move through time. So, we have got incremental cost against a relatively flat at some points during the last two quarters, decreasing pricing. So, I think that's what's actually resulting in the margin decline year-over-year. The strength in the market that we saw last year produced largest we had never seen before, Mike. And this is just a reflection of the reality that costs are up, and we haven't been able to offset all of those to-date. Yes. Fair question. That is just our projection of what we see on the ground. And so the increase in absorptions that we have seen, the relative stability in pricing gives us a little bit more confidence as we are looking at some of the deal flow that we \u2013 for land transactions, it does not anticipate or incorporate any M&A or anything of that sort that would happen separate from that, and we would evaluate it. But we haven't projected that in the overall increase. We haven't given that level of detail in a while. I think from a community count perspective, you have heard us say, we are investing in the entry level. So, our \u2013 a lot of the growth that you saw, we had growth across all three buyer segments in our community count. It was more oriented towards the first time. And interestingly, then next to the move-up and the active adult is those are bigger positions, so they don't \u2013 we don't have quite as much flexibility in those over time. But the 13% was spread across all, but it was largely in the first time. I was going to say it's hard to react to that. I think what we have seen reflected in our results is that we started fair number of homes that were speculative last year. They were available, and we have been able to sell them. We \u2013 I wouldn't characterize it as a huge incentive. I have mentioned earlier, we have a national rate buy-down, and it is probably most appealing to that buyer group. But it probably is only a relatively small percentage of our total population of signups that actually took that. They may have other things that are more important to some buyers. Yes. Candidly, no, most of the folks that we work with are pretty well capitalized. They are big developers in their market. And the truth is that we self-develop a great deal of the land that we control anyway. We are not \u2013 the vast majority of our business is actually self-funded. So \u2013 but for those deals where we have got partners, they are typically pretty well capitalized."

Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. Please go ahead.\nJames Zeumer: Thank you, Audra, and good morning. I want to welcome all participants to today's earnings call to review PulteGroup's operating and financial performance in the company's Q3 ended September 30, 2024. Here to review PulteGroup\u2019s Q3 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim. I appreciate everyone joining our call this morning as we discuss another quarter of strong operating and financial results for PulteGroup. As detailed in this morning's press release, driven primarily by a 12% increase in closings, we reported a 16% year-over-year increase in third quarter earnings to $3.35 per share. Inclusive of our strong Q3 financial performance, for the first three quarters of 2024 PulteGroup has realized double digit increases in closings, home sale revenues, and pretax income along with a 22% increase in reported earnings to $10.28 per share. In addition to delivering significant growth in revenues and earnings for the trailing 12 month period, PulteGroup realized a return on equity of 27%, while continuing to drive strong cash flow and lowering our debt to capital ratio to 12%. Our strong financial performance also allowed us to continue returning funds to shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2024, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is an increase of $200 million or 25% from last year in terms of funds allocated back to our investors. I think these numbers are all the more impressive given the fluctuating backdrop that we've all been working through. Over the course of the year, we've seen the 30-year mortgage rates climb from 6.75% in January, 7.5% in April, only to fall back to 6% in September. And then, of course, a recent climb in interest rates back to 6.75% has the 30-year mortgage rate back to where we started 2024. We track consumer sentiment among visitors to our website and our communities, and as you might expect, buyer confidence ebbs and flows with meaningful changes, or even just volatility and interest rates. This again proved to be the case as buyers reacted to the movement in rates during the third quarter. With mortgage rates hovering around 6.5% to begin the third quarter, buyers were generally less inclined to sign a purchase agreement. As interest rates declined through August and September, however, we experienced a noticeable pickup in overall activity. In fact, of the three months in the quarter, we generated the highest net new orders and absorption paces in the month of September. Driven by September's strong performance, the Q3 absorption pace of 2.4 orders per community per month was certainly above the typical pre-COVID numbers for the third quarter. The recent -- October has shown the highest web traffic, foot traffic and lead volume of the year. However, the recent rise in interest rates has demonstrated a more typical seasonal selling pattern and incentives have remained elevated as a consequence. Between rate volatility, the impact of hurricanes, and the upcoming presidential election, I think the upcoming spring selling season will offer the best assessment of fundamental housing demand. I think buyer reaction to the movement rates, both down and now up, again, affirms that affordability remains a tough hurdle to get over for many potential home buyers. The most recent S&P Case-Shiller Index shows home prices continue to hit all-time new highs, although the rate of appreciation has slowed, which in combination with expected lower mortgage rates could offer some relief to consumers going forward. As has been discussed extensively over the past few years, one of the pressure points that continue to push home prices higher is the fact that after years of underbuilding, this country has a housing deficit estimated at several million homes. The Mortgage Bankers Association issued a useful graphic a few weeks ago that is shown on Slide 15 in today's webcast slides. The graph shows housing stock added by decades since the 1940s. Looking at the graph, you can clearly see the significant drop in production during the past 15 years. To make this point even clearer, we modified the MBA graph by overlaying the growth in U.S. population over the decades. What you see is that just since the 1960s, our country's population has almost doubled to just shy of 350 million people, while housing production has been flat to down over the decades. Given the high cost of homeownership, rate buy-downs remain a powerful incentive in helping consumers bridge the affordability gap. In the third quarter, approximately 30% of our home buyers accessed our national rate program. To take advantage of our national rate incentive, home buyers will typically need to close within 30 to 60 days of signing the contract. So it's important that we continue to have an inventory of homes in production. At the end of the third quarter, 43% of the homes in production were specs, so we are well positioned to meet demand as we close out 2024. Along with benefiting from having inventory available, we are also continuing to make progress in lowering our cycle times. For homes delivered in the third quarter, our average cycle time was 114 days, down from 123 days in this year's second quarter. Cutting two weeks out of our production timeline is an important accomplishment, and it keeps us on track to reach our goal of 110 days by year end and be at 100 days in the first part of 2025. In truth, most of our divisions are already operating at or close to our 100-day ideal target. Our reported average is higher due to a handful of divisions, primarily those with large multi-family business, where cycle times remain elevated. In summary, operationally and financially, we accomplished a lot in the third quarter and are well positioned to have 2024 be a record year for PulteGroup. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our third quarter results.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan. And good morning. Driven by strong closing volumes, our third quarter home sale revenues increased 12% over last year to $4.3 billion. Our higher revenues in the period reflect a 12% increase in closings to 7,924 homes, while our average sales price in the quarter of $548,000 is effectively unchanged from the prior year and the second quarter of this year. Average sales prices by buyer group were also consistent with the prior year. The mix of our closings in the third quarter was 40% first time, 39% move up, and 21% active adult. In the third quarter of last year, the mix of closings was 38% first time, 37% move up, and 25% active adult. A slight decline in the percentage of closings from active adult buyers primarily reflects the timing of active adult community closeouts in 2023 and 2024 that we noted in our sign-up commentary during our second quarter earnings call. We expect a normalization of contribution from our active adult consumers when replacement active adult communities begin opening in 2025. Looking at our orders, net new orders in the third quarter totaled 7,031 homes, which is consistent with the 7,065 net new orders recorded in the third quarter of last year. It's worth noting that our average monthly absorption pace of 2.4 homes in the current quarter remains higher than our historic third quarter pre-COVID average, which was closer to 2.2 homes per month. Within the quarter, we did see a positive impact on monthly orders as interest rates declined from July through September. Compared with the prior year, Q3 orders decreased 3% for first time buyers, increased 6% for move up buyers, and decreased 5% for active adult buyers. Consistent with our guide, we operated out of an average of 957 communities during the quarter, which is an increase of just under 4% compared with the third quarter of last year. Based on activity during the quarter, quarter end backlog was 12,089 homes with a value of $7.7 billion, which compares with the backlog of 13,547 homes with a value of $8.1 billion at the end of the third quarter last year. During the quarter, we started approximately 7,800 homes and ended the quarter with a total of 17,096 homes under construction. These numbers are consistent with Q3 of last year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 7,400 spec homes in production, of which 1,357 homes were complete. This represents about 1.4 finished specs per community, which is consistent with the second quarter of this year. On a unit basis, 58% of our third quarter sales were spec sales, highlighting the importance of having inventory available to meet buyer demand. Buyer interest in spec production has been driven in part by our successful use of mortgage incentives, which are most effective when the consumer expects to close quickly. As always, we will continue to closely monitor consumer preferences for any changes if mortgage rates continue to decline. Based on the units we have under construction and their current stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,900 and 8,300 homes in the fourth quarter. I would highlight that this keeps us on track to meet or slightly exceed our full year closing target of 31,000 homes. Given the affordability challenges facing today's homebuying consumers and evolving market dynamics in key cities in which we operate, our pricing strategy seeks to ensure we maintain a compelling offering to all consumers. With that said, our average sales price in the third quarter was $548,000, which is consistent with our guide for average pricing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently expect our average sales price to be in a higher range of $555,000 to $565,000. As we have discussed on prior calls, this is largely due to a higher percentage of our closings coming from our western markets where selling prices are above company average. Our third quarter gross margin came in at a strong 28.8%. As we highlighted during our most recent earnings call, our margins in this quarter reflect an increasing percentage of our closings coming from our western markets, which relative to other parts of our business, have slightly lower margins. Our third quarter margins were also impacted by higher incentive costs incurred during the period. Incentives in the third quarter were 7%, which is a sequential increase of 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Given competitive market dynamics, higher incentives were needed to help ensure we continue to sell homes and turn our assets. As Ryan talked about, higher demand improved as interest rates declined in the third quarter, but overall market dynamics remain competitive. As such, we expect incentives to remain elevated for at least the remainder of the year. Given the anticipated geographic and product mix of fourth quarter closings and the expected need to maintain higher incentives, we currently expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 27.5% to 27.8%. Based on our fourth quarter guide, our full year gross margin would amount to approximately 29%. Continuing down the income statement, our reported SG&A expense in the third quarter was $407 million, or 9.4% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year's SG&A expense of $353 million, or 9.1% of home sale revenues. Our third quarter SG&A expense was in line with previous guidance and keeps us on track for SG&A expense of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues for the full year. I would note that our full year guide excludes the impact of the insurance adjustments recorded in the first and second quarters of this year. Our financial services operations reported another quarter of strong operating and financial results, as third quarter pre-tax income increased 90% over last year to $55 million. For the quarter, our financial services operations benefited from increased volume driven by the higher closing volumes in our home building business in combination with improved capture rates. In addition, we experienced increased profitability, particularly in our mortgage operations, due to improving market conditions driving higher market performance. In total for the quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $906 million, which represents an increase of 7% over the third quarter of last year. Our tax expense for the quarter was $208 million, or an effective tax rate of 23%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter includes a $14 million benefit associated with the purchase of renewable energy tax credits completed in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, excluding the impact of any potential incremental energy tax credit purchases. Looking at the bottom line, our reported net income was $698 billion, $3.35 per share, representing increases of 9% and 16%, respectively over the third quarter of last year. Earnings per share in the third quarter was calculated based on approximately 208 million diluted shares outstanding, which is down 5% from the prior year as the company continued to systematically executed share repurchase program. Consistent with our stated strategies, we continue to allocate incremental capital to the future growth of our home building platform. In the third quarter, we invested $1.4 billion in land acquisition and development, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets. On a year to date basis, we have invested $3.7 billion in land acquisition and development, and now expect our full year spend to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.2 billion as our land teams continue to do an exceptional job identifying and structuring land investments that meet our strict underwriting guidelines. Inclusive of our land spend in the quarter, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 56% were held via option. We continue to make steady progress in increasing the percentage of our land that we control via option as we seek to drive greater balance sheet efficiency in support of higher returns in the future. Based on our land pipelines and the expected timing of community openings and closings, we currently expect to operate out of an average of 950 communities in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 3% over the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to investing in the ongoing growth of our business, we continue to consistently return capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.5 billion common shares at a cost of $320 million, for an average price of $126.05 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares, or approximately 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year at a cost of $880 million or $115.74 per share Following these repurchases, we ended the period with just over $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. And finally, we ended the third quarter with a gross debt to capital ratio of 12.3%. Adjusting for the $1.5 billion cash on our balance sheet, our net debt to capital ratio was 1.4%. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of our organization as our local and national teams have done a great job navigating the ups and downs of 2024. Within such an environment, it's more important than ever that we continue to focus on the critical business strategies and tactics that have been instrumental to our success. First, we are continuing to invest in our business. We expect to invest just over $5 billion in land acquisition and development this year, underwriting to the same return hurdles and guidelines that we've had in place for more than a decade. Our disciplined process has allowed us to assemble a robust pipeline of what we believe are well located and high returning projects. In the process of underwriting new deals, we continue our migration toward controlling more land via option. This will be a multi-year effort, but we see the opportunity for increasing our option lot count as a way to enhance returns and help mitigate market risk. We have a long-term goal of getting to 70% option lots, which will be an evolutionary process as we work through our existing communities and add new option lot deals to the overall portfolio. Second, while we continue to invest in new land positions, we have to make sure we are efficiently and intelligently turning our existing land assets. Within our business model, we seek to achieve high returns by balancing the desire to maximize profitability of each home, while making sure we are turning our land assets. We often use the phrase, we can't be margin proud. The gross margin is an important driver of return on invested capital, and we don't want to give away lots that we've worked hard to secure. At the same time, we must be price competitive and offer a clear and compelling value to potential home buyers. I think our third quarter results show this balancing act as we continue to generate historically high gross margins, but we meaningfully increased incentives in response to the more competitive market conditions in which we are currently operating. And third, we must continue to allocate capital in alignment with our long stated priorities. As just discussed, we continue to invest in the ongoing growth of our business through land acquisition and development. If we achieve our 2024 land investment target of $5 billion, our five year land acquisition and development spend will total more than $20 billion. In a world where not in my backyard, it is alive and well, such investment represents countless hours of hard work by our land teams throughout the country. After investing capital to support the ongoing growth of our business, we continue to systematically return funds to shareholders, with 2024 being the fourth year in a row in which we will have returned over $1 billion back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over $20 billion invested in land, over $4 billion returned to shareholders and all while building a strong and highly supportive balance sheet with low leverage and high liquidity. I strongly believe this is a balance sheet that can support our growth plans, as well as continue to see us through the ups and downs of buyer demand that inevitably rolled through the housing industry. Let me close by thanking our entire organization for their hard work in delivering PulteGroup's outstanding operating and financial results. Hurricanes made this effort even tougher over the past few months, but I am incredibly proud, although not at all surprised, of how our team rallied to support fellow employees directly impacted by these storms. Your compassionate efforts are why PulteGroup remains a great place to work. Now I'll return the call back to Jim.\nJames Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And I'll ask Audra to again explain the process and open the call for questions. Audra?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to John Lovallo at UBS.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is maybe just help us on the sequential walk in gross margin from 28.8% in the third quarter to the range of 27.5% to 27.8% in the fourth quarter. Does that assume an incremental step up in incentives? And what is sort of the breakout between the headwind from incentives versus mix?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Hey, John. I think it's reflective of the current market that we're operating in. We highlighted in the commentary as it relates to Q3, coming into the quarter, we had given the guide and said that incentives would be flat. Obviously, they were a little bit richer than we had expected. We had a lot of homes to sell in the third quarter. The activity that we have seen has had that higher incentive load. We still have homes to sell in the fourth quarter. So it really is just a function of what we're seeing on the ground today. Another thing more broadly that impacts this is the slight step down in the active adult as a percentage of the mix. And so, we're -- we highlighted during the second quarter that we saw some closeouts, and so we've got some, for lack of better word, gap outs in active adult. So you've seen the percentage of our total business in active adult shrink a couple of basis points. That obviously has the highest margin contribution. So it's the combination of all those factors.\nJohn Lovallo: Understood. Okay. And then, Ryan mentioned, the hurricanes, obviously, there were two pretty devastating storms, Milton really hitting Florida pretty hard, and Helene going up into the Carolinas. What is the impact that you guys perhaps saw in the quarter, and what are you kind of contemplating as we move forward here as a potential impact on whether it's deliveries, orders, or whatever the case may be?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, John, it's Ryan. First thoughts and prayers go out to the communities and the individual families who were impacted by the storms. They were certainly both very large and devastating in different ways. I maybe start first by highlighting how well our communities performed. Both our communities that are in active construction as well as homes that we've recently closed. The new construction standards and the quality that we built to, the way the drainage systems are designed, I think are a real testament to just how effective some of those standards are. So we had very little damage in our active communities, which is a good news. The biggest impact is really two things, John. One, loss of time. So the three to four days to shut job sites down in advance of the storm, and then the three to four days kind of following the storms with cleanup. Those are days that are just hard to get back. Power is the second issue. So especially with Milton, the power outages were really widespread in Florida, especially in the Tampa and Southwest Florida areas. So power crews are focused on bringing the power grids back online. They're not as focused on setting new electrical meters for homes that will deliver in Q4. So we're still kind of working to quantify what those exact numbers are. We're confident in the guide that we've -- that Bob has provided to you. And we'll know more, I think, in the coming weeks as the power companies recover. The other maybe kind of third tier item would be some of the municipalities will be a little slower in responding to inspections, as they're dealing with kind of cleanup areas in the hard hit communities.\nJohn Lovallo: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: We'll move next to Alan Ratner at Zelman & Associates.\nAlan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Ryan. Just following up on the margin guide, you mentioned the mix of the business, the active adult, etc. And you kind of touched on the storms. But I guess this is kind of like a two part question specific to Florida. Your margins in Florida are well above company average. So I'm curious if that's impacting specifically the 4Q numbers, specifically for the guidance. But kind of more importantly, I guess, if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in Florida outside of the storm impact? There's a lot of concern about rising resale inventory in the market, challenged affordability. And I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that market relative to your very strong margins. Do you think there's an opportunity maybe to take advantage of that with taking share, maybe more incentivizing? Or do you feel like your land position in that market is so strong that you're, as you mentioned, not looking to give away those lots?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan. We're actually -- we remain very bullish on Florida. We talked about it a little bit in the end of our second quarter. And on a positive note, we had a great third quarter out of Florida. And a lot of the inventory trends, both on resale inventory and new inventory, have improved and they're down from where things peaked. So I think that's a positive in a quarter, which is typically one of the slower quarters in Florida is you end the nicer weather summer months up north. As we move into the fourth quarter and we get into what is the traditional [shoulder] (ph) season in Florida, where the snowbirds start coming back into town, I think we're well positioned to have a pretty good fourth quarter. So we're in every major city or almost every major city in Florida. We don't do a lot of business in Miami, but we're -- our brands are really strong there. We've got great communities. So I think Florida will continue to be a positive for us.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, Alan, it's interesting. You heard Ryan say how well our markets held up there. So we don't see a mix shift in the fourth quarter pending, of course, the municipality's ability to actually deliver permits, which you think that they will and we think we'll be able to work through. We had highlighted more of the geography and the margin is really that western markets have on a relative basis slightly lower margins for us and that's going to be a higher percentage in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. And then it's the incentives on the spec or entry level probably that have more influence and as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that, the incentive levels are going to stay high.\nAlan Ratner: Got it. That's helpful, Bob. And you kind of touched on -- you mentioned entry level higher incentives. I guess more broadly, you guys are one of, if not, the most diversified builders from a price point perspective. Can you just drill in a little bit in terms of what you're seeing at the various segments in terms of demand right now between entry, move up and active adult? I know you give the numbers on orders, but that doesn't always tell the whole story, given community count, openings and closings, et cetera.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, I'll take that one. I mentioned in my prepared remarks in October, and we've talked about it on prior calls, we do a survey with buyers that come to our website just about how confident they are about now being a good time to buy. We're at a 12-month high in that number, so I think that's generally a positive sign for the business. Our website traffic, our lead traffic, and our foot traffic into our stores also at 12 month highs. So there's a lot of real positive activity in the top of the funnel. And September was the best month in the quarter. Drilling down into the individual brands, the entry level buyer continues to be most challenged by affordability. So when rates came down in September, I think we saw a nice pickup in buying power that had a very favorable impact to that particular buyer. So I think that's a positive. The move up buyer continues to be really strong for us. And with that being 40% of our business, I think we're really well positioned for that consumer group to continue to perform well in the current environment. And if we're fortunate enough to see some improved rates in the next couple of months as we go into spring selling season, I think that particular buyer group will perform very well. And then active adult, and we've talked about this in years past, this is a buyer group that's probably most impacted by volatility in the market and uncertainty in the market. And right now, the thing that we're hearing the most about is the election. And there's just -- there's a lot of uncertainty around the nonstop barrage that we're getting with the election in a couple of weeks. So we're kind of waiting for the next couple of weeks to be over. And we think that buyer will come back into the market shortly thereafter.\nAlan Ratner: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate all the information so far. I wanted to focus specifically on timing. I think, you made a couple of comments about what you think may happen next year. I think you indicated that you thought that given the volatility in buyer demand due to rates that maybe we're really going to have to look to the spring selling season to sort of see how the market is ultimately going to settle out. And I think you're right on that. I think that the spring selling season is going to be a big focus probably for investors as well. And so, I'm just trying to get a sense for how you might see timing of certain things you've talked about evolve here over the next -- what it means for timing, I guess I should say. So first of all, you talked about the hurricane impact. You think that some of the delays that you felt from that will impact fully 4Q. Do you think that there's going to be any spillover into 1Q, particularly as it relates to deliveries, the revenues? You talked about the timing of the active adult gap out. I think you indicated that you thought that that would get better in 2025. Can you give us a sense for sort of when in 2025? And when in particular that might affect revenues because, obviously, these homes may take a while to build. Those are the two major ones that I wanted to understand better, what you're thinking about from a timing perspective?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We've given a guide for Q4 that we're confident in. So we think we've factored in kind of our best estimate of what the hurricane related delays and impacts will be. Things go quicker and better than expected. Potentially we get a few more closings in the fourth quarter, but we're confident in the guide that we've given. Then, as it relates to kind of 2025 and spillover impact from the hurricane, We haven't given a guide at this point. We'll do that at the end of next quarter. History is a guide. I think the system will come back online. And other than, again, power related setting of transformers and energizing communities, those are the things that I think we sometimes see some delays around. But we'll tell you more about that as we get closer. As it relates to kind of active adult, we'll also give you our community count guide next year. Those communities have been on the pipeline for a long time. They're actively being developed right now. So we've got great visibility to when they're going to open. And most of those will start to open in the back half of 2025 and then start to show closings in 2026. But we haven't given a guide for 2025, other than, I would reiterate, we've talked about kind of our long-term growth guide of wanting to operate the business in a 5% to 10% growth window.\nStephen Kim: And if we look -- just staying on the active adult side a little bit, it sounds like 2024 -- most of 2024 had maybe a richer mix of active adult than we're going to have in 2025. And just -- and then it will, sounds like it'll become a little richer again. When you're thinking about managing the business over the long term, Ryan, which is more typical of what you think that the product mix, particularly I'm speaking about active adult, is likely to be for your company. Are you managing it with the land that you're sort of purchasing today? Are you managing it to more like of a mix of 2024 or more of a mix of 2025?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Stephen, we're still running the company and managing the land mix. It's important to be 25% -- about 25% of the business. So the current mix in 2024 is actually on the light side. And as these new communities, where we're in a little bit of a gap out, as those come online in 2025, you'll actually, and Bob mentioned it in his prepared remarks, you'll see the mix go back to our kind of typical contribution levels, which is in that roughly 25% overall business.\nStephen Kim: Got you. Certainly as it relates to orders. Okay, I got you. That's helpful. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to Anthony Pettinari at Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about stick and brick costs in the quarter and then assumptions for 4Q. And it seems like lumber may have been kind of a good guy for part of this year on a year-over-year basis, but it's kind of ticked up recently. Just wondering if you could remind us your lag on lumber prices and any thoughts there?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks for the question. To be honest, we've experienced minimal inflation on our vertical costs this year. We're running right at $80 a square foot, which is consistent with the last three quarters and actually consistent with third quarter of last year. So when we look at it for the full year, we expect kind of a very low single digit inflation on our vertical costs.\nRyan Marshall: Anthony, as it relates to lumber, it varies by market. Most of our lumber we buy on a 13-week trailing random length average. It effectively helps lock in the margin at the time of contract with the customer so that we're not experiencing margin volatility during the build process.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then just following up on resale inventories. Ryan, I think you indicated inventories were kind of maybe getting a little bit better or normalizing a bit compared to three months ago in Florida. And I was just wondering if there were other markets, Texas or out West where resale inventories are a little bit elevated or conversely where -- markets where inventories feel tight?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, I wouldn't highlight any other markets in terms of kind of inventory issues. You mentioned Texas. Texas is the market that's been a little choppier in the last few months. It's a place where there's probably more competition. Every major builder is in every market in Texas. So -- and there were a few markets there. Austin is one I highlight that had unprecedented price appreciation, that there were really high paying jobs that went there post COVID, with a lot of relocations and there were short inventories. So we saw maybe less than -- less than kind of moderated pace around price appreciation. So I think there's a few markets there that are probably still going through some price normalization, those are markets that I think will continue to fare well. There's good jobs there, taxes are relatively affordable and there are places where people want to be. So we're still confident on our Texas markets as well.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut at JP Morgan. And Michael, your line is open. You may have yourself muted.\nMichael Rehaut: Yep. Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I wanted to circle back a little bit to the cadence of incentives during the quarter. I think you broadly kind of described incentives as having remained elevated throughout the quarter, you expected to remain elevated into the fourth quarter. I was curious on where incentives began 3Q and where it ended. And if there was any decline in incentives in September, as you said, you had particularly strong demand.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, I think you can see from the guide that we've given and we've suggested -- not suggested, we've told you we seen elevated incentives continuing. We didn't really see those mitigate during the quarter. It's worth highlighting, the rate that we're offering is below market already. And so, the movement in the 30-year doesn't really influence us as much as what do we need to do both competitively and from the affordability construct for the consumer. So, if you see a 25 basis point move in the 30 year, we're already 100 plus inside that with our incentive programs. And so, what we're telling you is that the consumer needs some help with the affordability and the incentives in the way we're getting there.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Right. I guess what I'm getting at is, typically when you do see an increase in demand, maybe it's not the initial reaction, but over, let's say, several months, I believe it is kind of normal to see incentives start to take down at that overall higher level of demand kind of works through. So I'm curious, that's really what I'm more curious about, maybe if it's not the first month of a reaction, given that you said it was really more concentrated in September in terms of the improvement in demand. If you know that were to have been more sustained over the following months, if you would normally see that, I think what I would characterize as a typical decline in incentives, at least for the move up buyers perhaps, which aren't helped as much by that rate buy down. That's what I'm more curious about, I guess.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we'll have to see, I think is the answer to that. We -- rates ticked back up, right? So at the end of the day, we'll see if the Fed continues down a path to reduce interest rates and Ryan said in his prepared comments, we think that the selling season is going to be a better indicator of overall demand. And to your point, if the rate environment improves and demand is strong, yes, I think we'd have an opportunity to reduce our incentive.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. Secondly, just on from a regional perspective, you kind of highlighted the inventory dynamics in Florida and Texas. I'm curious also for those markets, relative to the rest of your markets, if you've seen an increase in incentives in those markets, just given all the hype around resale inventory levels, if you've seen a significant or unusual increase in incentives in those markets, let's say, today versus six months ago.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Texas, Mike, is the market that I would tell you has probably been more competitive just because of the number of competitors that are there. It's nothing that I would suggest is -- I wouldn't suggest anything, we've done is out of line or is on the level of making us uncomfortable, but probably higher incentives in the Texas markets than what we saw earlier in the year. I think Bob just indicated, we'll see what the fourth quarter kind of provides is possibly we see some reduction in interest rates and that may give us the opportunity to back off of incentives a little bit.\nMichael Rehaut: All right, thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Dahl: Hey, Thanks for taking my questions. We're going to stick with margin dynamics. So, Bob, I think last quarter when you guided to kind of sequential step down in margins inn 3Q and 4Q relative to 2Q, you already anticipated the mix dynamic, so is the mix even different and more of a headwind in 4Q than you originally anticipated or is the right way to think about the sequential and 4Q gross margin really -- you already -- you've highlighted the mix. That's what it is. But the delta versus your prior guide is really the incentive load.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, on balance, it's not changing dramatically. We've got a little bit more Western market business, again, the strength there on a relative basis, it really relates to the incentives or as we've highlighted a couple of times now, it's a challenging affordability equation and we're looking to meet it so that we turn our assets.\nMichael Dahl: Yes, that makes sense. And then the follow-up is really drilling down on incentives. If you can provide a little more color, you talked about the 7% on total incentive load, and that's up 70 bps sequentially. But in the commentary, it seems like it's suggested it's really that the incremental change may have been predominantly on entry level. Can you help us quantify what the incentives on entry level are or were in 3Q and in your 4Q guide and maybe how that compares quarter-on-quarter.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yeah, that's probably a slice of the [indiscernible] a little too thin. Again, affordability is a challenge for all of our consumers. The entry level feels it first and the most, and so it's going to be a little bit richer for them, but I wouldn't want to parse it quite that thinly.\nMichael Dahl: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Carl Reichardt at BTIG.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks. Hi, guys. Nice to talk to you. I want to go back to Florida again, sort of bigger picture and longer term. So obviously, there's been some talk about intermediate term migration patterns changing there, whether that's the frequency of weather or insurance conditions, high prices. So if you're thinking about investing capital, say in 2027 or beyond in new deals there, do these dynamics impact your thinking, especially given those markets are competitive too, as you're talking about Texas? Do you require a higher rate of return to invest there? How do you think about sort of beyond the very -- the intermediate term, the short term, in terms of where you place capital regionally, if you think these dynamics in Florida might be changing, or are you sticking with it?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Carl, thanks for the question. Florida has been very good to our business. We do have a lot of capital invested there today. So for what it's worth, we'd like to continue to see Florida perform well for the investments that we've already made and the capital that's already been committed. As it relates to future stuff, I think we'll take inputs as they come from the market. We're not going to blindly continue to go after things if we're seeing a change in market conditions. I think that's one of the disciplines that we have in our underwriting criteria. I still remain really bullish on Florida. In fact, if you look at the parts of Florida where we're investing, they're a little more inland. They're on higher ground. They're not places that are being impacted by the things that you see on TV. Some of the things that you see on TV are the things that are right on the beach. They're the coastal areas. There are homes that were built in the 70s and 80s, not up to current code. It's devastating. It's terrible. I don't think anybody would want it to happen. But my sense is, our business is not probably directly impacted by some of the things that you're seeing on TV. I'd highlight that some of the moves that you're seeing are kind of within Florida. So they're intra Florida moves as opposed to out of Florida moves. Florida remains a place that's got great quality of life. Maybe it's not as favorable of a deal as it used to be, but still relatively affordable. There's good jobs there. There's no state income taxes. So there are some offsets to some of the things like rising insurance rates and the like.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, Ryan, I appreciate that. And then my second question is on off balance sheet. 56% off balance sheet now or option lots and the 70% is the goal. Is it still your intention to bridge that gap via effective land banking and as opposed to, say, farmer options? And what are you seeing right now in the land banking market in terms of pricing terms? Have the negotiations, the discussions you've had with the large bankers kind of gone as you expected or are you seeing challenges there that you didn't expect? Thanks, guys.\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, Carl, we're making nice progress on our land options, up to 56% in the quarter. We've highlighted it'll be a journey. We think it'll probably take somewhere around three -- three to three and a half years in total. As we cycle through our land portfolio to accrete up to the 70% level, but we're clicking off the milestones as intended. So I'm really pleased with how our land teams are performing on that front. We'd expect 50% of our land to be with farmer options or land seller options. The other 20% that we're looking for to be optioned will come from bankers. Our land banking team's done a really nice job building out a portfolio of bankers that we're working with. They're consistent, they're behaving in a very predictable way, and it's working out incredibly well for us. Interest rates, their money is tied to kind of what you see in the interest rate environment more broadly in the market. So we got a little bit of improvement on some stuff that we did in the third quarter. We'll have to see how things go in the fourth quarter, depending on what happens with rates. But we're pleased with how the land banking program is working.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Trevor Allinson at Wolfe Research.\nTrevor Allinson: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, a question on conversion rates. You guys talked about 5% to 10% growth annually. I think that included 2025. Just given where your backlog is trending, I think that would imply a pretty notable improvement in backlog conversion rate next year to grow closing to 5% or more. So any commentary on is that what you're expecting, improvement in conversion rates? And then if so, maybe talk about the drivers of that, whether that be the improved cycle time that you guys referenced earlier or any additional spec, any other drivers to call out?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Trevor. Backload conversion rate is something that -- that's a number that can be impacted by two things. One, cycle time, getting better or worse. We indicated in the prepared remarks our cycle times will continue to come down. So we'll certainly get some benefit from that. And then the other piece is spec inventory by the definition, those homes that are in production that are spec are not in backlog. So, a lot of those will sell and convert in the same quarter and they won't show up in that metric. So, I don't want to tell you how to run your models, but given the percentage of spec inventory that we're starting and selling, given the current interest rate environment, I think probably a better metric is to look at homes in production, total homes in production, as a good indicator of whether or not we have the available homes to deliver in the next year's closing volume.\nTrevor Allinson: Okay, understood. And then I guess the second question then would be kind of following up on that. Finished inventory, 1.4 finished specs per community. That's a little bit above your longer term target number of one. Can you talk about how you feel about your current completed specs level and how you're thinking about spec production then moving forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, in the current environment we're selling -- almost 40% of our business is coming through first time, which tends to be predominantly spec or mostly spec. And in the current interest rate environment, we actually want higher spec inventory as a percentage of WIP. And when we had historically pre-COVID operated at. So the things that you've heard us most recently talk about is being between 35% and 45% of total WIP and at the end of this most recent quarter we're at 40 -- I think 42% of our total inventory is spec. So we feel like we're right in line there. On the finish side, when we were operating in more of a built to order model, I think one per community was a pretty good number. And we're not abandoning that. We're slightly over that at 1.4. But we don't feel that we have any inventory exposure that's got us uncomfortable at this point. We're selling over 50% of the homes that we're selling right now are selling at some form of spec, so they're at some form of production moving through the pipeline. So we feel pretty good there as well.\nTrevor Allinson: Okay, makes sense. Thank you for taking my question and good luck moving forward.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Sam Reid at Wells Fargo.\nSam Reid: Awesome, thanks so much. Last quarter I want to say you guys mentioned that land costs were likely to trend up about high single digits in 2024. Just looking to confirm kind of how that trended in the third quarter, what's embedded in the fourth quarter guidance? And then I know you're not necessarily talking 2025 now, but you do have some visibility here. So just curious as to whether that's a reasonable assumption in the next year.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we did see high single digit lot cost increase in Q3. We do see that in Q4. We have not provided a guide for 2025, but we've said this before. Our lot costs haven't decreased in more than a decade. Land is more expensive. And as you cycle through older land, the stuff coming out is more expensive. We'll give some color as to what that means for 2025 when we give our 2025 guide.\nSam Reid: That's fair. And then just sticking to kind of housekeeping questions and apologies if this was already covered, but just wanted to ask about options in lot premiums as a percent of ASP. I want to say last quarter it was around $104,000. Just curious what that was in Q3? And then perhaps what's embedded in guidance for the fourth quarter.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes, we were $100,000 in Q3. So relatively consistent, and that is embedded in our guide for Q4 as well. Worth it to highlight that, a lot of that option revenue and lot premium comes from our move up and active adult buyers. So you're at, call it, 60% of our business is driving most of that. And to further the comment that Ryan made earlier, that's not where we're doing most of the speculative building.\nSam Reid: No, it makes sense. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Matthew Bouley at Barclays.\nMatthew Bouley: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Back on that 5% to 10% growth that you kind of reiterated as a long-term target, I'm wondering if in fact that is still the plan for 2025 specifically and kind of to what extent you're willing to flex around that growth target maybe depending on where rates are or kind of general consumer demand is, and any thoughts around if there's a margin or incentive trade-off in your minds at which you might kind of dial back that volume growth? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Matt, we haven't given a 2025 guide. We'll do that at the end of next quarter. The long-term guide that we gave was meant to be that. It was kind of a multi-year guide of how we're positioning the business and investing in the land. So 2025 specifically, we will tell you more next quarter.\nMatthew Bouley: Okay, fair enough. And then maybe one on the balance sheet, just the, I think the net debt capital of 1.4%. I'm curious if the kind of increase in land banking that you're targeting is actually playing into how you're managing the balance sheet here, if there is kind of a need to either hold on to more cash or kind of keep leverage low, if that is playing into it at all, or just more generally, what would be your thoughts around kind of increasing that leverage back to prior levels? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Matt, we talked about this a little bit, I think on prior calls. And our view is, we've got a view on how we're investing in the business, how we're growing the business, and that's driving what our capital needs are. We then look to what operating cash flow is, how much of the business investment strategy we can finance with our own cash and with the operating cash flow. And then we go to kind of debt or other capital market mechanisms. I think the way to look at leverage is it's an outcome as opposed to it being a driver. Bob, anything else you\u2019d add there?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: No, other than to say in terms of land banking specifically, what it is really going to do is free up cash. As we increase the relative percentage of optionality, our balance sheet on a relative basis gets smaller. So it will give us more choices to Ryan's point about what to do with that cash.\nMatthew Bouley: All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Jim for closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Appreciate everybody's time today. We're certainly available as the day goes on for any additional questions. Otherwise, we'll look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call. Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Ryan. And good morning. Driven by strong closing volumes, our third quarter home sale revenues increased 12% over last year to $4.3 billion. Our higher revenues in the period reflect a 12% increase in closings to 7,924 homes, while our average sales price in the quarter of $548,000 is effectively unchanged from the prior year and the second quarter of this year. Average sales prices by buyer group were also consistent with the prior year. The mix of our closings in the third quarter was 40% first time, 39% move up, and 21% active adult. In the third quarter of last year, the mix of closings was 38% first time, 37% move up, and 25% active adult. A slight decline in the percentage of closings from active adult buyers primarily reflects the timing of active adult community closeouts in 2023 and 2024 that we noted in our sign-up commentary during our second quarter earnings call. We expect a normalization of contribution from our active adult consumers when replacement active adult communities begin opening in 2025. Looking at our orders, net new orders in the third quarter totaled 7,031 homes, which is consistent with the 7,065 net new orders recorded in the third quarter of last year. It's worth noting that our average monthly absorption pace of 2.4 homes in the current quarter remains higher than our historic third quarter pre-COVID average, which was closer to 2.2 homes per month. Within the quarter, we did see a positive impact on monthly orders as interest rates declined from July through September. Compared with the prior year, Q3 orders decreased 3% for first time buyers, increased 6% for move up buyers, and decreased 5% for active adult buyers. Consistent with our guide, we operated out of an average of 957 communities during the quarter, which is an increase of just under 4% compared with the third quarter of last year. Based on activity during the quarter, quarter end backlog was 12,089 homes with a value of $7.7 billion, which compares with the backlog of 13,547 homes with a value of $8.1 billion at the end of the third quarter last year. During the quarter, we started approximately 7,800 homes and ended the quarter with a total of 17,096 homes under construction. These numbers are consistent with Q3 of last year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 7,400 spec homes in production, of which 1,357 homes were complete. This represents about 1.4 finished specs per community, which is consistent with the second quarter of this year. On a unit basis, 58% of our third quarter sales were spec sales, highlighting the importance of having inventory available to meet buyer demand. Buyer interest in spec production has been driven in part by our successful use of mortgage incentives, which are most effective when the consumer expects to close quickly. As always, we will continue to closely monitor consumer preferences for any changes if mortgage rates continue to decline. Based on the units we have under construction and their current stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,900 and 8,300 homes in the fourth quarter. I would highlight that this keeps us on track to meet or slightly exceed our full year closing target of 31,000 homes. Given the affordability challenges facing today's homebuying consumers and evolving market dynamics in key cities in which we operate, our pricing strategy seeks to ensure we maintain a compelling offering to all consumers. With that said, our average sales price in the third quarter was $548,000, which is consistent with our guide for average pricing to be in the range of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking at the fourth quarter, we currently expect our average sales price to be in a higher range of $555,000 to $565,000. As we have discussed on prior calls, this is largely due to a higher percentage of our closings coming from our western markets where selling prices are above company average. Our third quarter gross margin came in at a strong 28.8%. As we highlighted during our most recent earnings call, our margins in this quarter reflect an increasing percentage of our closings coming from our western markets, which relative to other parts of our business, have slightly lower margins. Our third quarter margins were also impacted by higher incentive costs incurred during the period. Incentives in the third quarter were 7%, which is a sequential increase of 70 basis points from the second quarter of this year. Given competitive market dynamics, higher incentives were needed to help ensure we continue to sell homes and turn our assets. As Ryan talked about, higher demand improved as interest rates declined in the third quarter, but overall market dynamics remain competitive. As such, we expect incentives to remain elevated for at least the remainder of the year. Given the anticipated geographic and product mix of fourth quarter closings and the expected need to maintain higher incentives, we currently expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 27.5% to 27.8%. Based on our fourth quarter guide, our full year gross margin would amount to approximately 29%. Continuing down the income statement, our reported SG&A expense in the third quarter was $407 million, or 9.4% of home sale revenues. This compares with prior year's SG&A expense of $353 million, or 9.1% of home sale revenues. Our third quarter SG&A expense was in line with previous guidance and keeps us on track for SG&A expense of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues for the full year. I would note that our full year guide excludes the impact of the insurance adjustments recorded in the first and second quarters of this year. Our financial services operations reported another quarter of strong operating and financial results, as third quarter pre-tax income increased 90% over last year to $55 million. For the quarter, our financial services operations benefited from increased volume driven by the higher closing volumes in our home building business in combination with improved capture rates. In addition, we experienced increased profitability, particularly in our mortgage operations, due to improving market conditions driving higher market performance. In total for the quarter, we reported pre-tax income of $906 million, which represents an increase of 7% over the third quarter of last year. Our tax expense for the quarter was $208 million, or an effective tax rate of 23%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter includes a $14 million benefit associated with the purchase of renewable energy tax credits completed in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, excluding the impact of any potential incremental energy tax credit purchases. Looking at the bottom line, our reported net income was $698 billion, $3.35 per share, representing increases of 9% and 16%, respectively over the third quarter of last year. Earnings per share in the third quarter was calculated based on approximately 208 million diluted shares outstanding, which is down 5% from the prior year as the company continued to systematically executed share repurchase program. Consistent with our stated strategies, we continue to allocate incremental capital to the future growth of our home building platform. In the third quarter, we invested $1.4 billion in land acquisition and development, of which 56% was for the development of existing land assets. On a year to date basis, we have invested $3.7 billion in land acquisition and development, and now expect our full year spend to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.2 billion as our land teams continue to do an exceptional job identifying and structuring land investments that meet our strict underwriting guidelines. Inclusive of our land spend in the quarter, we ended the quarter with approximately 235,000 lots under control, of which 56% were held via option. We continue to make steady progress in increasing the percentage of our land that we control via option as we seek to drive greater balance sheet efficiency in support of higher returns in the future. Based on our land pipelines and the expected timing of community openings and closings, we currently expect to operate out of an average of 950 communities in the fourth quarter, which would represent an increase of 3% over the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to investing in the ongoing growth of our business, we continue to consistently return capital to shareholders. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.5 billion common shares at a cost of $320 million, for an average price of $126.05 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares, or approximately 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year at a cost of $880 million or $115.74 per share Following these repurchases, we ended the period with just over $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. And finally, we ended the third quarter with a gross debt to capital ratio of 12.3%. Adjusting for the $1.5 billion cash on our balance sheet, our net debt to capital ratio was 1.4%. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Hey, John. I think it's reflective of the current market that we're operating in. We highlighted in the commentary as it relates to Q3, coming into the quarter, we had given the guide and said that incentives would be flat. Obviously, they were a little bit richer than we had expected. We had a lot of homes to sell in the third quarter. The activity that we have seen has had that higher incentive load. We still have homes to sell in the fourth quarter. So it really is just a function of what we're seeing on the ground today. Another thing more broadly that impacts this is the slight step down in the active adult as a percentage of the mix. And so, we're -- we highlighted during the second quarter that we saw some closeouts, and so we've got some, for lack of better word, gap outs in active adult. So you've seen the percentage of our total business in active adult shrink a couple of basis points. That obviously has the highest margin contribution. So it's the combination of all those factors. Yes, Alan, it's interesting. You heard Ryan say how well our markets held up there. So we don't see a mix shift in the fourth quarter pending, of course, the municipality's ability to actually deliver permits, which you think that they will and we think we'll be able to work through. We had highlighted more of the geography and the margin is really that western markets have on a relative basis slightly lower margins for us and that's going to be a higher percentage in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. And then it's the incentives on the spec or entry level probably that have more influence and as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that, the incentive levels are going to stay high. Thanks for the question. To be honest, we've experienced minimal inflation on our vertical costs this year. We're running right at $80 a square foot, which is consistent with the last three quarters and actually consistent with third quarter of last year. So when we look at it for the full year, we expect kind of a very low single digit inflation on our vertical costs. Right. I guess what I'm getting at is, typically when you do see an increase in demand, maybe it's not the initial reaction, but over, let's say, several months, I believe it is kind of normal to see incentives start to take down at that overall higher level of demand kind of works through. So I'm curious, that's really what I'm more curious about, maybe if it's not the first month of a reaction, given that you said it was really more concentrated in September in terms of the improvement in demand. If you know that were to have been more sustained over the following months, if you would normally see that, I think what I would characterize as a typical decline in incentives, at least for the move up buyers perhaps, which aren't helped as much by that rate buy down. That's what I'm more curious about, I guess. Yes, we'll have to see, I think is the answer to that. We -- rates ticked back up, right? So at the end of the day, we'll see if the Fed continues down a path to reduce interest rates and Ryan said in his prepared comments, we think that the selling season is going to be a better indicator of overall demand. And to your point, if the rate environment improves and demand is strong, yes, I think we'd have an opportunity to reduce our incentive. Yes, on balance, it's not changing dramatically. We've got a little bit more Western market business, again, the strength there on a relative basis, it really relates to the incentives or as we've highlighted a couple of times now, it's a challenging affordability equation and we're looking to meet it so that we turn our assets. Yeah, that's probably a slice of the [indiscernible] a little too thin. Again, affordability is a challenge for all of our consumers. The entry level feels it first and the most, and so it's going to be a little bit richer for them, but I wouldn't want to parse it quite that thinly. Yes, we did see high single digit lot cost increase in Q3. We do see that in Q4. We have not provided a guide for 2025, but we've said this before. Our lot costs haven't decreased in more than a decade. Land is more expensive. And as you cycle through older land, the stuff coming out is more expensive. We'll give some color as to what that means for 2025 when we give our 2025 guide. Yes, we were $100,000 in Q3. So relatively consistent, and that is embedded in our guide for Q4 as well. Worth it to highlight that, a lot of that option revenue and lot premium comes from our move up and active adult buyers. So you're at, call it, 60% of our business is driving most of that. And to further the comment that Ryan made earlier, that's not where we're doing most of the speculative building. No, other than to say in terms of land banking specifically, what it is really going to do is free up cash. As we increase the relative percentage of optionality, our balance sheet on a relative basis gets smaller. So it will give us more choices to Ryan's point about what to do with that cash."

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. I appreciate everyone joining our call this morning as we discuss another quarter of strong operating and financial results for PulteGroup. As detailed in this morning's press release, driven primarily by a 12% increase in closings, we reported a 16% year-over-year increase in third quarter earnings to $3.35 per share. Inclusive of our strong Q3 financial performance, for the first three quarters of 2024 PulteGroup has realized double digit increases in closings, home sale revenues, and pretax income along with a 22% increase in reported earnings to $10.28 per share. In addition to delivering significant growth in revenues and earnings for the trailing 12 month period, PulteGroup realized a return on equity of 27%, while continuing to drive strong cash flow and lowering our debt to capital ratio to 12%. Our strong financial performance also allowed us to continue returning funds to shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2024, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This is an increase of $200 million or 25% from last year in terms of funds allocated back to our investors. I think these numbers are all the more impressive given the fluctuating backdrop that we've all been working through. Over the course of the year, we've seen the 30-year mortgage rates climb from 6.75% in January, 7.5% in April, only to fall back to 6% in September. And then, of course, a recent climb in interest rates back to 6.75% has the 30-year mortgage rate back to where we started 2024. We track consumer sentiment among visitors to our website and our communities, and as you might expect, buyer confidence ebbs and flows with meaningful changes, or even just volatility and interest rates. This again proved to be the case as buyers reacted to the movement in rates during the third quarter. With mortgage rates hovering around 6.5% to begin the third quarter, buyers were generally less inclined to sign a purchase agreement. As interest rates declined through August and September, however, we experienced a noticeable pickup in overall activity. In fact, of the three months in the quarter, we generated the highest net new orders and absorption paces in the month of September. Driven by September's strong performance, the Q3 absorption pace of 2.4 orders per community per month was certainly above the typical pre-COVID numbers for the third quarter. The recent -- October has shown the highest web traffic, foot traffic and lead volume of the year. However, the recent rise in interest rates has demonstrated a more typical seasonal selling pattern and incentives have remained elevated as a consequence. Between rate volatility, the impact of hurricanes, and the upcoming presidential election, I think the upcoming spring selling season will offer the best assessment of fundamental housing demand. I think buyer reaction to the movement rates, both down and now up, again, affirms that affordability remains a tough hurdle to get over for many potential home buyers. The most recent S&P Case-Shiller Index shows home prices continue to hit all-time new highs, although the rate of appreciation has slowed, which in combination with expected lower mortgage rates could offer some relief to consumers going forward. As has been discussed extensively over the past few years, one of the pressure points that continue to push home prices higher is the fact that after years of underbuilding, this country has a housing deficit estimated at several million homes. The Mortgage Bankers Association issued a useful graphic a few weeks ago that is shown on Slide 15 in today's webcast slides. The graph shows housing stock added by decades since the 1940s. Looking at the graph, you can clearly see the significant drop in production during the past 15 years. To make this point even clearer, we modified the MBA graph by overlaying the growth in U.S. population over the decades. What you see is that just since the 1960s, our country's population has almost doubled to just shy of 350 million people, while housing production has been flat to down over the decades. Given the high cost of homeownership, rate buy-downs remain a powerful incentive in helping consumers bridge the affordability gap. In the third quarter, approximately 30% of our home buyers accessed our national rate program. To take advantage of our national rate incentive, home buyers will typically need to close within 30 to 60 days of signing the contract. So it's important that we continue to have an inventory of homes in production. At the end of the third quarter, 43% of the homes in production were specs, so we are well positioned to meet demand as we close out 2024. Along with benefiting from having inventory available, we are also continuing to make progress in lowering our cycle times. For homes delivered in the third quarter, our average cycle time was 114 days, down from 123 days in this year's second quarter. Cutting two weeks out of our production timeline is an important accomplishment, and it keeps us on track to reach our goal of 110 days by year end and be at 100 days in the first part of 2025. In truth, most of our divisions are already operating at or close to our 100-day ideal target. Our reported average is higher due to a handful of divisions, primarily those with large multi-family business, where cycle times remain elevated. In summary, operationally and financially, we accomplished a lot in the third quarter and are well positioned to have 2024 be a record year for PulteGroup. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our third quarter results. Thanks, Bob. I'm very proud of our organization as our local and national teams have done a great job navigating the ups and downs of 2024. Within such an environment, it's more important than ever that we continue to focus on the critical business strategies and tactics that have been instrumental to our success. First, we are continuing to invest in our business. We expect to invest just over $5 billion in land acquisition and development this year, underwriting to the same return hurdles and guidelines that we've had in place for more than a decade. Our disciplined process has allowed us to assemble a robust pipeline of what we believe are well located and high returning projects. In the process of underwriting new deals, we continue our migration toward controlling more land via option. This will be a multi-year effort, but we see the opportunity for increasing our option lot count as a way to enhance returns and help mitigate market risk. We have a long-term goal of getting to 70% option lots, which will be an evolutionary process as we work through our existing communities and add new option lot deals to the overall portfolio. Second, while we continue to invest in new land positions, we have to make sure we are efficiently and intelligently turning our existing land assets. Within our business model, we seek to achieve high returns by balancing the desire to maximize profitability of each home, while making sure we are turning our land assets. We often use the phrase, we can't be margin proud. The gross margin is an important driver of return on invested capital, and we don't want to give away lots that we've worked hard to secure. At the same time, we must be price competitive and offer a clear and compelling value to potential home buyers. I think our third quarter results show this balancing act as we continue to generate historically high gross margins, but we meaningfully increased incentives in response to the more competitive market conditions in which we are currently operating. And third, we must continue to allocate capital in alignment with our long stated priorities. As just discussed, we continue to invest in the ongoing growth of our business through land acquisition and development. If we achieve our 2024 land investment target of $5 billion, our five year land acquisition and development spend will total more than $20 billion. In a world where not in my backyard, it is alive and well, such investment represents countless hours of hard work by our land teams throughout the country. After investing capital to support the ongoing growth of our business, we continue to systematically return funds to shareholders, with 2024 being the fourth year in a row in which we will have returned over $1 billion back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over $20 billion invested in land, over $4 billion returned to shareholders and all while building a strong and highly supportive balance sheet with low leverage and high liquidity. I strongly believe this is a balance sheet that can support our growth plans, as well as continue to see us through the ups and downs of buyer demand that inevitably rolled through the housing industry. Let me close by thanking our entire organization for their hard work in delivering PulteGroup's outstanding operating and financial results. Hurricanes made this effort even tougher over the past few months, but I am incredibly proud, although not at all surprised, of how our team rallied to support fellow employees directly impacted by these storms. Your compassionate efforts are why PulteGroup remains a great place to work. Now I'll return the call back to Jim. Yes, John, it's Ryan. First thoughts and prayers go out to the communities and the individual families who were impacted by the storms. They were certainly both very large and devastating in different ways. I maybe start first by highlighting how well our communities performed. Both our communities that are in active construction as well as homes that we've recently closed. The new construction standards and the quality that we built to, the way the drainage systems are designed, I think are a real testament to just how effective some of those standards are. So we had very little damage in our active communities, which is a good news. The biggest impact is really two things, John. One, loss of time. So the three to four days to shut job sites down in advance of the storm, and then the three to four days kind of following the storms with cleanup. Those are days that are just hard to get back. Power is the second issue. So especially with Milton, the power outages were really widespread in Florida, especially in the Tampa and Southwest Florida areas. So power crews are focused on bringing the power grids back online. They're not as focused on setting new electrical meters for homes that will deliver in Q4. So we're still kind of working to quantify what those exact numbers are. We're confident in the guide that we've -- that Bob has provided to you. And we'll know more, I think, in the coming weeks as the power companies recover. The other maybe kind of third tier item would be some of the municipalities will be a little slower in responding to inspections, as they're dealing with kind of cleanup areas in the hard hit communities. Yes, Alan. We're actually -- we remain very bullish on Florida. We talked about it a little bit in the end of our second quarter. And on a positive note, we had a great third quarter out of Florida. And a lot of the inventory trends, both on resale inventory and new inventory, have improved and they're down from where things peaked. So I think that's a positive in a quarter, which is typically one of the slower quarters in Florida is you end the nicer weather summer months up north. As we move into the fourth quarter and we get into what is the traditional [shoulder] (ph) season in Florida, where the snowbirds start coming back into town, I think we're well positioned to have a pretty good fourth quarter. So we're in every major city or almost every major city in Florida. We don't do a lot of business in Miami, but we're -- our brands are really strong there. We've got great communities. So I think Florida will continue to be a positive for us. Yes, Alan, I'll take that one. I mentioned in my prepared remarks in October, and we've talked about it on prior calls, we do a survey with buyers that come to our website just about how confident they are about now being a good time to buy. We're at a 12-month high in that number, so I think that's generally a positive sign for the business. Our website traffic, our lead traffic, and our foot traffic into our stores also at 12 month highs. So there's a lot of real positive activity in the top of the funnel. And September was the best month in the quarter. Drilling down into the individual brands, the entry level buyer continues to be most challenged by affordability. So when rates came down in September, I think we saw a nice pickup in buying power that had a very favorable impact to that particular buyer. So I think that's a positive. The move up buyer continues to be really strong for us. And with that being 40% of our business, I think we're really well positioned for that consumer group to continue to perform well in the current environment. And if we're fortunate enough to see some improved rates in the next couple of months as we go into spring selling season, I think that particular buyer group will perform very well. And then active adult, and we've talked about this in years past, this is a buyer group that's probably most impacted by volatility in the market and uncertainty in the market. And right now, the thing that we're hearing the most about is the election. And there's just -- there's a lot of uncertainty around the nonstop barrage that we're getting with the election in a couple of weeks. So we're kind of waiting for the next couple of weeks to be over. And we think that buyer will come back into the market shortly thereafter. Yes, Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We've given a guide for Q4 that we're confident in. So we think we've factored in kind of our best estimate of what the hurricane related delays and impacts will be. Things go quicker and better than expected. Potentially we get a few more closings in the fourth quarter, but we're confident in the guide that we've given. Then, as it relates to kind of 2025 and spillover impact from the hurricane, We haven't given a guide at this point. We'll do that at the end of next quarter. History is a guide. I think the system will come back online. And other than, again, power related setting of transformers and energizing communities, those are the things that I think we sometimes see some delays around. But we'll tell you more about that as we get closer. As it relates to kind of active adult, we'll also give you our community count guide next year. Those communities have been on the pipeline for a long time. They're actively being developed right now. So we've got great visibility to when they're going to open. And most of those will start to open in the back half of 2025 and then start to show closings in 2026. But we haven't given a guide for 2025, other than, I would reiterate, we've talked about kind of our long-term growth guide of wanting to operate the business in a 5% to 10% growth window. Yes, Stephen, we're still running the company and managing the land mix. It's important to be 25% -- about 25% of the business. So the current mix in 2024 is actually on the light side. And as these new communities, where we're in a little bit of a gap out, as those come online in 2025, you'll actually, and Bob mentioned it in his prepared remarks, you'll see the mix go back to our kind of typical contribution levels, which is in that roughly 25% overall business. Anthony, as it relates to lumber, it varies by market. Most of our lumber we buy on a 13-week trailing random length average. It effectively helps lock in the margin at the time of contract with the customer so that we're not experiencing margin volatility during the build process. Yes, I wouldn't highlight any other markets in terms of kind of inventory issues. You mentioned Texas. Texas is the market that's been a little choppier in the last few months. It's a place where there's probably more competition. Every major builder is in every market in Texas. So -- and there were a few markets there. Austin is one I highlight that had unprecedented price appreciation, that there were really high paying jobs that went there post COVID, with a lot of relocations and there were short inventories. So we saw maybe less than -- less than kind of moderated pace around price appreciation. So I think there's a few markets there that are probably still going through some price normalization, those are markets that I think will continue to fare well. There's good jobs there, taxes are relatively affordable and there are places where people want to be. So we're still confident on our Texas markets as well. Yes, Mike, I think you can see from the guide that we've given and we've suggested -- not suggested, we've told you we seen elevated incentives continuing. We didn't really see those mitigate during the quarter. It's worth highlighting, the rate that we're offering is below market already. And so, the movement in the 30-year doesn't really influence us as much as what do we need to do both competitively and from the affordability construct for the consumer. So, if you see a 25 basis point move in the 30 year, we're already 100 plus inside that with our incentive programs. And so, what we're telling you is that the consumer needs some help with the affordability and the incentives in the way we're getting there. Yes, Texas, Mike, is the market that I would tell you has probably been more competitive just because of the number of competitors that are there. It's nothing that I would suggest is -- I wouldn't suggest anything, we've done is out of line or is on the level of making us uncomfortable, but probably higher incentives in the Texas markets than what we saw earlier in the year. I think Bob just indicated, we'll see what the fourth quarter kind of provides is possibly we see some reduction in interest rates and that may give us the opportunity to back off of incentives a little bit. Yes, Carl, thanks for the question. Florida has been very good to our business. We do have a lot of capital invested there today. So for what it's worth, we'd like to continue to see Florida perform well for the investments that we've already made and the capital that's already been committed. As it relates to future stuff, I think we'll take inputs as they come from the market. We're not going to blindly continue to go after things if we're seeing a change in market conditions. I think that's one of the disciplines that we have in our underwriting criteria. I still remain really bullish on Florida. In fact, if you look at the parts of Florida where we're investing, they're a little more inland. They're on higher ground. They're not places that are being impacted by the things that you see on TV. Some of the things that you see on TV are the things that are right on the beach. They're the coastal areas. There are homes that were built in the 70s and 80s, not up to current code. It's devastating. It's terrible. I don't think anybody would want it to happen. But my sense is, our business is not probably directly impacted by some of the things that you're seeing on TV. I'd highlight that some of the moves that you're seeing are kind of within Florida. So they're intra Florida moves as opposed to out of Florida moves. Florida remains a place that's got great quality of life. Maybe it's not as favorable of a deal as it used to be, but still relatively affordable. There's good jobs there. There's no state income taxes. So there are some offsets to some of the things like rising insurance rates and the like. Yeah, Carl, we're making nice progress on our land options, up to 56% in the quarter. We've highlighted it'll be a journey. We think it'll probably take somewhere around three -- three to three and a half years in total. As we cycle through our land portfolio to accrete up to the 70% level, but we're clicking off the milestones as intended. So I'm really pleased with how our land teams are performing on that front. We'd expect 50% of our land to be with farmer options or land seller options. The other 20% that we're looking for to be optioned will come from bankers. Our land banking team's done a really nice job building out a portfolio of bankers that we're working with. They're consistent, they're behaving in a very predictable way, and it's working out incredibly well for us. Interest rates, their money is tied to kind of what you see in the interest rate environment more broadly in the market. So we got a little bit of improvement on some stuff that we did in the third quarter. We'll have to see how things go in the fourth quarter, depending on what happens with rates. But we're pleased with how the land banking program is working. Yes, Trevor. Backload conversion rate is something that -- that's a number that can be impacted by two things. One, cycle time, getting better or worse. We indicated in the prepared remarks our cycle times will continue to come down. So we'll certainly get some benefit from that. And then the other piece is spec inventory by the definition, those homes that are in production that are spec are not in backlog. So, a lot of those will sell and convert in the same quarter and they won't show up in that metric. So, I don't want to tell you how to run your models, but given the percentage of spec inventory that we're starting and selling, given the current interest rate environment, I think probably a better metric is to look at homes in production, total homes in production, as a good indicator of whether or not we have the available homes to deliver in the next year's closing volume. Yes, in the current environment we're selling -- almost 40% of our business is coming through first time, which tends to be predominantly spec or mostly spec. And in the current interest rate environment, we actually want higher spec inventory as a percentage of WIP. And when we had historically pre-COVID operated at. So the things that you've heard us most recently talk about is being between 35% and 45% of total WIP and at the end of this most recent quarter we're at 40 -- I think 42% of our total inventory is spec. So we feel like we're right in line there. On the finish side, when we were operating in more of a built to order model, I think one per community was a pretty good number. And we're not abandoning that. We're slightly over that at 1.4. But we don't feel that we have any inventory exposure that's got us uncomfortable at this point. We're selling over 50% of the homes that we're selling right now are selling at some form of spec, so they're at some form of production moving through the pipeline. So we feel pretty good there as well. Yes, Matt, we haven't given a 2025 guide. We'll do that at the end of next quarter. The long-term guide that we gave was meant to be that. It was kind of a multi-year guide of how we're positioning the business and investing in the land. So 2025 specifically, we will tell you more next quarter. Yes, Matt, we talked about this a little bit, I think on prior calls. And our view is, we've got a view on how we're investing in the business, how we're growing the business, and that's driving what our capital needs are. We then look to what operating cash flow is, how much of the business investment strategy we can finance with our own cash and with the operating cash flow. And then we go to kind of debt or other capital market mechanisms. I think the way to look at leverage is it's an outcome as opposed to it being a driver. Bob, anything else you'd add there?"

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor relations. You may begin.\nJames Zeumer: Great. Thanks, Rob. I want to welcome everyone to PulteGroup's earnings call to discuss our strong financial performance for our second quarter ended June 30th, 2024. Here to review PulteGroup's Q2 results are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O'Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. Copy of our earnings release and this morning's presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We'll post an audio replay of this call later today. I want to alert everyone that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company's expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today's earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan Marshall. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Jim, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results, which reflect an approach to the business in which we seek to balance price, pace and investment over the long-term to generate superior returns. Consistent with this strategy, our financial results continue to show the power of capitalizing on the value of each lot and home we sell. Our divisions work extremely hard to secure, entitle and develop our land assets and work equally hard to generate exceptional profitability, while still turning our portfolio at an appropriate rate. Specific to our second quarter performance, we realized a 2% increase in average sales price, an 8% increase in closings, and a 30 basis point gain in gross margin, which in aggregate, helped drive a 19% increase in earnings to a second quarter record of $3.83 per share. Another quarter of overall strong financial performance, highlighted by our double-digit earnings growth, resulted in PulteGroup generating a return on equity of 27.1% for the trailing 12-month period. Obviously, a key driver of our strong financial results and high returns on invested capital continues to be the company's outstanding gross margins. As Bob will discuss, gross margins in the period benefited from a favorable mix of closings, but I would also highlight the pricing strength evident in our numbers. In Q2, product options and lot premiums averaged $104,000 per home and represented approximately 19% of our average sales price of $549,000. As I'm sure you can all appreciate, options and lot premiums are high-margin dollars and an important contributor to PulteGroup's outsized margins relative to peers. I know how hard our employees work to deliver such outstanding results and I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts. As good as our second quarter numbers are, it's fair to say that as we navigated through the period, demand was a little less consistent than we experienced in the first quarter of 2024. On our Q1 earnings call, we noted buyer traffic had slowed the first few weeks of April. While subsequent Wall Street channel checks confirmed a change in short-term demand, the fact remains that we are operating in a housing market that has been underbuilt relative to population, immigration and household formation for more than a decade. The resulting housing deficit of several million homes is likely a structural reality for years to come, given the zoning challenges we face in most municipalities. Our country's underlying new home supply issue has been exacerbated by the lock-in effect caused by the dramatic rise in interest rates over the last two years. What the market continues to experience is existing homeowners who are unwilling or more likely unable to give up the low rate mortgages originated several years ago. As a consequence, the inventory of quality existing homes remains below long-term averages in many markets. The supply imbalance is one of the reasons that I am confident in the long-term demand trends for housing in this country, but I'd appreciate that buyer demand will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For example, the bump in interest rates in the second quarter caused some buyers to become more cautious, while others saw affordability stretched beyond their financial capacity. While many cities are facing a limited supply of homes for sale, we have seen an increase in existing and new home supply in select markets in Florida and Texas. These markets are now in the process of finding the new clearing price needed to work down any excess inventory. Maybe more impactful than rates and inventory, the feedback we are getting points to a lack of confidence among some consumers that now is a good time to buy. High prices, higher interest rates and the resulting high monthly payments are making potential buyers more cautious in purchasing a new home. To the degree that this lack of confidence among consumers reflects affordability concerns, this isn't new, and in fact, it's something we address on a market-by-market, even community-by-community basis every day. It was more than a year ago that you first heard me say that delivering high returns requires that we turn our assets and that we won't be margin proud. In an environment where market conditions are more competitive, we have worked to ensure that our products, prices and incentives are clearly meeting buyer needs. Consistent with this focus on turning our assets, we continue to build a more efficient and faster turning land pipeline. In the quarter, lots controlled via option increased to 53% of total lots. We are successfully building on our historic base of lots option directly with the land sellers by increasing our use of third-party land bankers. To-date, we have entered into transactions representing almost 13,000 lots and $1.5 billion of capital. As with all land-related activities, we are being disciplined in how we expand this part of our portfolio, but we are making steady progress in assembling a more efficient land pipeline. As we sit here at the midpoint of 2024, I would say that it is shaping up to be a very good year for Pulte. Relative to our expectations coming into 2024, not only did we raise our initial closing guide by 1,000 homes, but we are clearly on a gross margin path well above our initial guide. For various reasons, market conditions got a little tougher in the second quarter, but we continue to actively manage price, pace and starts to drive the best business outcome. Based on the current demand conditions and construction cycle times, we continue to start homes at a pace consistent with closing 31,000 homes this year, as well as positioning the company to grow 5% to 10% in 2025, consistent with the multiyear outlook we have discussed previously. Through the first few weeks of July, traffic to our communities has been solid, but depending on how demand conditions and absorption paces evolve up or down in each market over the balance of the year, we will adjust our starts pace as needed. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup generated second quarter home sale revenues of $4.4 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues for the period was driven by an 8% increase in closings to 8,097 homes, in combination with a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in our ASP reflects modest price increases in our first-time and active adult communities, while prices in our move-up communities were consistent with last year. The increase in our average sales prices for the quarter also reflects the impact of mix, as we recorded higher closings within our move-up business, which at $650,000 carried much higher prices than our first-time and active adult business. Broken down by buyer group, closings in the second quarter consisted of 40% first-time, 37% move-up and 23% active adult. This compares with the mix of closings in the second quarter of last year, which was 41% first-time, 34% move-up and 25% active adult. Reflecting the headwinds caused by higher rates and other market dynamics, our 7,649 net new orders were down 4% from last year's exceptionally strong results. In particular, I would highlight that last year's Q2 orders benefited from Del Webb grand opening and built-for-rent sales that are lumpy in nature. As has been well reported, operating conditions in select Florida and Texas markets got more competitive in the second quarter as interest rates rose during the month of April. On our first quarter earnings call this year, we indicated that buyer traffic had slowed during the first few weeks of April and this slowdown did ultimately impact orders as we moved through the period. For the second quarter, our average community count was 934, which is an increase of 3% over the same period last year. The resulting absorption pace of 2.7 orders per community per month in the quarter is above the pre-COVID average, but down from the 2.9 we generated last year. More granularly, our net new orders in the second quarter decreased 3% among first-time buyers, increased 4% among move-up buyers, and decreased 17% among active adult buyers. While we continue to see strong demand among active adult buyers, we did report a larger year-over-year decrease in their second quarter quarters. That decrease primarily reflects lower community count in the current year and some impact from the timing of openings and closings of several of our Del Webb communities. Adjusting for the impact of these dynamics, our net new orders at stores that were operating consistently in both periods shows an order decrease of only 3%. Consistent with our overall order results, on a unit basis, our quarter end backlog was down 4% to 12,982 homes, although backlog value was down only 1% to $8.1 billion. Turning to production. We started at approximately 8,100 homes in the second quarter and ended the quarter with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Of the 17,250 homes under construction, approximately 6,900 or 40% of spec, including an average of 1.3 finished specs per community. These levels are in line with our targets of 40% and one finished spec per community and put us in a position to meet our delivery targets over the balance of the year. As always, we are prepared to adjust our cadence of spec starts up or down in response to sustained changes in overall higher demand. Based on the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,400 and 7,800 homes in the third quarter and continue to expect to close approximately 31,000 homes for the full year. As noted, we realized an average sales price of $549,000 in the second quarter, which is consistent with our prior guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking ahead, we expect closings in the third and fourth quarters to be in that same range of $540,000 to $550,000. While our average price and backlog is higher than our guide, we have a lot of homes left to sell and close this year, most of which will be spec production with our first-time buyer communities where pricing is lower. We reported second quarter gross margin of 29.9%, which represents an increase of 30 basis points over both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. As in Q1 of this year, our reported gross margins reflect a favorable mix of closings and a generally supportive pricing environment for many of the spec sales we closed in the quarter. Second quarter gross margins also benefited from opportunities we've taken in prior quarters to improve net pricing in a number of communities across our portfolio. Consistent with such actions, incentives on closings in the second quarter was 6.3% selling price, which is down from 6.5% in the first quarter of this year. While recent macro data has sparked optimism about the potential for Fed rate cuts, we don't factor such expectations into our guidance. What we do know is that rates remain elevated, affordability is stretched, and our delivery mix will be less favorable in the back half of the year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, in the third and fourth quarters, we will be closing more homes in our West region, where homes carry a lower relative margin profile than we did in the first half of the year. These factors, combined with our need to be price competitive to turn assets point to an expected gross margin of approximately 29% in the third quarter and 28.5% to 29% in the fourth quarter. As stated previously, we still have homes to sell and close to meet our full-year delivery guide of 31,000 units. So, demand conditions over the next few months can have an impact on the results built. In the second quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $361 million, or 8.1% of home sale revenues. Reported SG&A includes a $52 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In Q2 of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $315 million, or 7.8% of home sale revenue, which includes a $65 billion pre-tax insurance benefit. Excluding the impact of the insurance benefits recorded in the first two quarters of this year, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Turning to our financial services operations. We reported pre-tax income of $63 million in the second quarter, which is up from $46 million in the same period last year. The 36% increase in pre-tax income reflects strong financial performance across all business lines, including mortgage, title and insurance. Our performance also benefited from an increase in capture rates across all business lines, including a mortgage capture rate of 86% in the quarter, up from 80% last year. In total, reported pre-tax income for the second quarter was $1 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over last year. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $239 million, with an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter includes the benefit of energy tax credits and a $13 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. For the remaining quarters this year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Taken altogether, we reported net income of $809 million or $3.83 per share. This compares to prior year reported net income of $720 million, or $3.21 per share. On a per share basis, we continue to benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, which on a year-over-year basis reduced shares outstanding by 5% from last year. Capitalizing on our strong cash flows, we continue to support the future growth of our business as we invested approximately $1.2 billion in land acquisition and development in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date land spend to just over $2.3 billion, keeping us on track to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year. For both the quarter and the first six months of 2024, the allocation of land spend was 60% development and 40% acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 225,000 lots under control, of which 53% were held via option. Given the strength of our land pipeline, we continue to forecast community count growth of 3% to 5% in the third and fourth quarters of this year over the comparable prior periods last year. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million common shares at a cost of $314 million, or an average price of $113.79 per share. This brings our year-to-date share repurchase activity to a total of 5.1 million shares repurchased at a cost of $560 million or $110.58 per share. In addition to repurchasing stock, we also completed a tender offer for $300 million of our senior notes in the second quarter. As a result, our debt-to-capital ratio is now just 12.8% and our notes payable have decreased to $1.7 billion, which represents the lowest level since before we acquired Del Webb in 2001. After spending more than $1.8 billion during the quarter on land investment and the purchase of our equity and debt, we ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion of cash. Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the quarter end was 1.8%. I'm also pleased to report that in acknowledgement of our improved operations, strong cash flow generation and outstanding balance sheet, Fitch recently upgraded our debt to BBB+, while Moody's upgraded its outlook to positive. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. During the first half of 2024, traffic to our communities was good and absorption pace ran slightly above historic norms. So, I feel good about our opportunities in the back half of the year. To the degree that the Fed actually cuts interest rates in the coming months, I think that will provide a powerful tailwind both financially and psychologically as we enter 2025. Before turning the call back to Jim, I would draw your attention to a release we issued a couple of weeks ago about one of our newest community openings and our first in Utah in more than 20 years. Along with representing PulteGroup's reentry into my home state, Utah is the seventh greenfield new market entry we have initiated over the past few years. Through the first half of 2024, we increased home sale revenues by 10% and grew reported earnings per share by 25% over the last year. Over the same period, we increased our land investment by 31% to $2.3 billion, while increasing year-to-date share repurchases and dividend payments by 37% to $645 million. We also retired $300 million of debt. PulteGroup has executed extremely well and with expectations of closing 31,000 homes for the full year, we are in excellent position to drive strong results going forward. And finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to briefly address the press release we issued yesterday announcing our CFO succession plans. After a truly impactful 13-year career with PulteGroup, Bob O'Shaughnessy has initiated a transition toward retirement at the end of 2025. Step one in this process is that Bob will relinquish his title as Chief Financial Officer effective early February of next year. I'm pleased to say that Bob will then remain with us for another 10 months as Executive Vice President. During that time, he will support a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities, as well as continue to oversee our financial services business, our strategic partnerships and our asset management committee. Since its founding, PulteGroup's greatest strength has always been the talented people who work here. Reflecting this depth of exceptional people, I'm proud to announce that Jim Ossowski, currently Senior Vice President of Finance, has been named as the company's next CFO. Jim has had an outstanding 22-year career at PulteGroup, during which time he has served as VP of Finance and Corporate Controller, VP of Finance, Homebuilding Operations, Area VP of Finance and Director of Corporate Audit. In his current role as SVP of Finance, he manages our critical asset management committee and FP&A function. Jim has been promoted to Executive Vice President and CFO effective February of 2025. At that time, Jim will report directly to me and will have responsibility for our accounting, tax, audit, risk management and treasury functions. In announcing these changes now, we ensure having plenty of time to implement a seamless transition of responsibilities. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim.\nJames Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan. We're now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. And I'll ask Rob to again explain the process and we'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nStephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Congrats on the results and congrats to Jim and Bob. I'm glad to hear that we got a great transition going. So, congrats to everybody. Wanted to ask a couple of questions. If I could start off just by talking about your gross margin outlook. You indicated that you're going to be doing more in the West, I think, which is a little bit lower margin. And you also talked about, on a longer-term basis, increasing your land banking initiative. I was wondering if you could give us a sense. If you were to isolate the land banking, the increased use of land bankers, I know that this is going to take a little time to kind of flow through all your results. But once that has happened and you reach the targeted level that you think land banking is going to represent in your mix, how much of a margin impact overall do you think that, that alone would represent relative to where you are today?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah. Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. Maybe the first part of the question about the margin in the balance of the year related to the West. We mentioned last quarter and it's continued into this quarter. The West has performed better than it had in kind of prior periods. So, we've got a heavier mix of West Coast closings coming through. Those margins on a relative basis are a little bit lower. And so we've factored that into the margin guide that we've given for Q3 and Q4. The margins are, I think, you'll agree, incredibly, incredibly strong at the levels that we've guided to. As it relates to land banking, we're making great progress. The goal that we've kind of laid out is to get from the historical 50% options that we've been running at to 70%. That incremental kind of 20% move was going to be done with land bankers. I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're making great progress. It's steady, it's deliberate, and we're absolutely on the path to get to 70%. In terms of the trade between margin and return, that's what we typically look at is we're looking. What we're ultimately looking for is we're looking for transfer of risk. And with that, we typically see somewhere between 200 basis points to 300 basis point trade between margin and return. Every deal is unique. So to paint it with any more of a broad brush than that, I think wouldn't be fair. And then the closing comment I'd make is -- and I know you know this, Stephen, but we underwrite return, not the margins. Return is what we believe ultimately drives shareholder value.\nStephen Kim: Absolutely. That's very helpful. That 20% increase in the 200 basis points to 300 basis points, which is also pretty standard across the industry. So, that's helpful. Wanted to talk about cycle times because also when you talk about returns being able to build more quickly and therefore more efficiently also helps you in your return goals. Can you update us on where your cycle times sit today relative to, let's say, a pre-pandemic kind of a situation? And if you think there's additional opportunities there and wrapped up in that, can you give us an update on ICG? It's been a while since we've kind of heard you talk about it. You've had it now for over about four years, I think. Just give us a sense for sort of where that fits into the overall cycle time progression?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: It's a great question, Stephen. So, cycle time days in the quarter on closings were 123 days. So, that's a pickup of about a week from where we were in Q1. I would say, today, we've got a number of divisions where the cycle times are at or below kind of that 100-day target that we've set for ourselves. But we do still have some divisions where it's elevated. I see trade availability is probably what's holding some of those divisions back. Looking forward, as we look to the end of the year, we'll probably be slightly elevated over that 100-day target that we set. But we're working hard and we think we can get there in the first half of '25.\nRyan Marshall: Stephen, it's Ryan again. I'll take the ICG question. We're pleased with how ICG is performing. We've got two active plants, both located in the Southeast part of the US. They do a mix of our business, along with other single-family homebuilder business. And we have a decent amount of commercial business that runs through those plants as well, predominantly in the frame package for apartments. If there was a part of the ICG business that's lagging, it would be that commercial business with the slowdown in new apartment development or new apartment projects starting. We do have a physical location secured and owned. Actually, more than secured. We own a location for our third ICG plant. We have not started construction on that yet. We're just finalizing some of the design parameters for that new location. So as we have more details on that, we'll be sure to share it. We're pleased with not only the cycle time benefits that we get out of ICG, the quality pickups, better safety. We also think we get better cost just in the way that we're able to buy, particularly lumber as it flows into the ICG plant. So happy with how that business is performing.\nStephen Kim: Okay. Great. Appreciate all the color, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. You spoke about the uptick in inventory on the existing home side in certain markets like Southwest Florida and I think, Texas, you mentioned. Are these levels concerning to you? Are there any markets where that inventory is concerning? And are you seeing more of an impact on your move-up business versus your entry level? Or how would you kind of characterize that?\nRyan Marshall: Yeah, John, it's a good question. Probably the one market that's higher than what we'd ideally like to see would be Southwest Florida. There we've seen inventory -- resale inventory levels approach about nine months, with the benchmark or the kind of equilibrium rate being six months. So, we're a tad elevated. I wouldn't consider it concerning. That's been a very strong market for a long time. I think it continues to be a really desirable place for retirees and second homeowners. So, I think that market had unprecedented price appreciation. Part of the reason that I think we're seeing some of the elevated inventory levels. The market will go through a bit of an adjustment. It will find a clearing price and I'd expect inventory levels to come back to kind of a more normal range. There are a few markets in Texas that I think are in similar situation. Austin, Dallas would be the two that I would probably highlight. That I have also seen unprecedented growth in population, jobs, and resulting home price increases. But other than the nine months of inventory in Southwest Florida, there's probably nothing that I'd characterize as concerning.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: One thing I might add to that. It's worth it to remember if they're selling a home more often than not, that's also a buyer. So it's not really net supply add to the market. It can influence pricing as much as anything else. And retail has always been our biggest competitor. We always have -- we have the advantage today of being able to offer rate incentives to the buyers. So for the demand that's there, we are a compelling choice first of that resale inventory.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the cash flow, is $1.8 billion still the cash flow guide for the full year? You guys did, I think, $246 million of buybacks in the first quarter, another $314 million in the second quarter. How are you kind of thinking about that cash flow in the back half and the ability to repurchase more shares?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Well, certainly, our cash flow guide is still current. And I think we've historically not given a view as to how much we're going to be repurchasing in the forward periods. We've let our kind of actions speak for themselves. You can and should expect to see us continue to be in market.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning and congratulations to Bob and Jim. You indicated your guidance doesn't anticipate lower rates. And I'm just wondering, if benchmark mortgage rates were to fall 50 bps or 100 bps, is it possible to quantify what that would do to gross margin holding all else equal? And then maybe kind of a harder question to answer, do you get a sense that there's meaningful group of prospective buyers that are kind of on the sidelines until we get a move in rates?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. It's an interesting question and I wish I had a perfect answer for you, but a lot of it will depend on what is prompting that decline in rates, right? We've talked about this before. If the economy is healthy, lower rates are good because it means that the consumer's wallet is still healthy and they still have a job and the lower interest rate environment allows them to save some money. I think in that environment, we would expect to see margins a tailwind because our incentive load likely goes down. If it is in concert with that, we're worried about recessionary impacts, GDP, not healthy jobs, not as solid as they are today. That has another influence. The other thing that factors into this is supply, right? We talked about it in some markets. It's a little bit more competitive. And so there could be a scenario where we've made it clear we want to sell homes, and we're going to find the price that's going to get there. While we may be able to save a little bit of money on the incentive for the financing, we may be in a position where we're giving some of that in some other form of incentive. So like I said, I don't know, Ryan, if you want to comment, but the broader environment is important to that is just what happened to rates. We've always said rates are interesting, but they are only one element of the consumer equation.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And then sorry if I missed this, but in terms of stick and brick costs in the quarter and then what your maybe second half gross margin guidance assume or contemplates, can you just give us kind of color on those trends?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: So the stick and brick costs in the second quarter were $80 per square foot. That's flat with the first quarter of this year. As we look ahead, we expect inflation to be manageable maybe low single-digits over the balance of the year backing us.\nJames Ossowski: And that's incorporated into the guide that we've provided.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Maybe worth highlighting I think Jim's referencing primarily vertical. The land costs, we've talked about kind of high single-digit increases through '24 also embedded in that guide.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and I also want to offer my congrats to Bob and Jim. First, I wanted to circle back to the comments around the shift of the business over time to more lot optioning and just wanted to kind of clarify the comments earlier, you said that when you kind of move from a regular perhaps owned land position to a lot bank land position. I just want to make sure we understood that right, that it kind of shifts 200 to 300 basis points of gross margin, take that out of gross margin, but shifts it into return on equity, if we heard that right. And if we're talking about a 20% shift of the business, effectively 200 to 300 bps times 20%, we're talking about 40 to 60 bps impact of moving from gross margin to ROE. Just want to make sure that we're understanding that correctly. And if there's any other factors that we should consider in that longer-term move to more lot optioning and land banking?\nRyan Marshall: Hey, Mike, it's Ryan. I think the way you've articulated is accurate. So I think you're understanding it right. I would reiterate that the 50% that we have in our business today of land options. Those are land options with the underlying seller and that's been the case for the last seven or eight years. So that's not a change. And going forward, we'd expect that to remain in that kind of 50-ish percent range. So the incremental optionality taking us from 50 to 70, that's the piece that will have more land banking in it.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Maybe just one point of clarification. I'd rather we're speaking to the IRR on the transaction as opposed to our return on equity. Like our equity gets influenced by lots of other things ultimately when you kind of get to the parent level. But on a deal-by-deal basis, banks versus nonbank, it is roughly a 200 to 300 basis point cost and margin and then a roughly 200 to 300 basis point benefit to the return on that transaction.\nMichael Rehaut: Right. That's very helpful. And I think it's important to clarify that. Secondly, maybe looking at the balance sheet, I believe you still are kind of running below your target levels, which, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe are the 20% to 30% debt-to-cap ratio, net debt more or less around zero the last several quarters. How should we think about the potential to maybe even getting that leverage back to your targeted range? What's the potential for that? I think as you're kind of entering perhaps even a more of a tailwind type of macro backdrop to the extent that rates start coming down, how should we think about the balance sheet and the ability, particularly as you're shifting more and more towards lot optioning? What is the right amount of leverage. And to the extent that there's a potential to increase share repurchase as we've been thinking about this with other companies. How should we think about that for Pulte in the next several years?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, the way that I'd ask you to think about capital allocation is we look at the needs of the business first and foremost. And that starts with how much investment do we want to put into land? How much investment do we want to put into dividends? How much investment do we want to put into share repo and as evidenced in over the last couple of years, we've even been retiring debt. So we look at the collective needs of the business and then we think about how are we going to finance that. The business is performing incredibly well, and we've been generating great cash flow and that cash flow put us in a very favorable position where we haven't needed the levels of debt that we've historically used in the business. So I think we can all agree that having an appropriate amount of leverage in a business is advantageous and efficient from a return standpoint. That's part of the reason that we set kind of our target rate at 20% to 30%. But we're not going to let the tail wag the dog here. We look at how we want to run the business, think about the capital that we need for that and then we look at how we're going to finance it. And in the position that we're in, we're in a great position to have lower leverage, lower debt and still do all of the things that we want to do strategically from an investment standpoint. So I take the position that we're in from an overall debt level any day of the week and twice on Sunday. Could the business absorb or handle more debt certainly but again, the number one priority is how do we want to run the business and then we go figure out how to finance it. Bob, anything else do you want to add to that?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: No, other than that furthering Ryan's point, as we get a more efficiently on pipeline, i.e., more optionality, I think, we get to a point where our cash flows better match our earnings. So less of the cyclicality on the balance sheet and the impact on cash flows from inventory changes, which is that the environment we operate today is going to generate a lot of cash. So it's not likely that we would be levering from here.\nMichael Rehaut: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to follow-up on some of the comments on Florida and Texas. Can you talk about what you would sort of attribute the slowdown and the higher inventory in those markets too? Like what's driving that? And then the comments on the price discovery process, where are we in that process? Have you seen prices correct already? Or is that something you would expect going forward?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Rafe, thanks for the question. I think what's created some of the increase in inventory is the unprecedented rise in price, which has caused some owners to become sellers for whatever reason. Those high prices have created a bit of an affordability challenge that prospective buyers are struggling to kind of digest at this point. So as I mentioned on one of the prior questions, I think what happens here, there'll be a little bit of a kind of price market clearing price adjustment process that will happen over time. I think it takes a terribly long time. But over the next probably three, six, nine months, I would expect that market to kind of work through some of the buildup of inventory. I'd point you to as an example, Austin. If you looked at the Austin market going back probably two years ago, a couple of years post-COVID unprecedented job growth, combined with unprecedented rise in sales prices, all of a sudden, the market kind of came to a bit of a slowdown. We saw build in inventory. It took about six months for the market to kind of work through some of that inventory and it settled back into kind of a more normal run rate growth rate. So my expectation would be probably for something similar to happen as it relates to Southwest Florida.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thank you. That's really helpful. And then just on the gross margin guidance for the second half of the year, I think you were previously expecting sort of consistent 29% and through the back half, the expectation for the change in the outlook for the fourth quarter for sort of the exit rate, is that driven entirely by mix? Or are there other factors that are changing that expectation for the fourth quarter?\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. It's really a combination of two primary things. One is it's the mix that we've highlighted. And to a degree, we saw that coming. So it was in the 29 area that we had given back at the end of the first quarter, but that has continued. So we've got a bigger mix kind of number than we saw 90 days ago. And really, we've highlighted the market's gotten a little bit choppier and so we see that there's likely to be a little bit more incentive. We told you we've got homes to sell and close. And so we're projecting that into our guide as well. I think it's worth highlighting the range that we've given now is a little bit lower, but it includes that same point that we had been at the beginning -- at the end of the first quarter. So I don't want anybody to misconstrue. We don't see a big change in market. This is really just kind of circumstance driven.\nRafe Jadrosich: Thanks for all the color.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Rafe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys. Good morning. My congrats to Bob and Jim as well. So I'm actually going to take kind of the opposite side of the margin question because I actually think the guidance is pretty similar to your prior guide when you kind of consider the moving pieces with the upside this quarter, what seems like a bit of a mix shift in the back half of the year. And I guess I was hoping you might reconcile that a little bit with the comments on Texas and Florida because those two states are a pretty sizable part of your business, over 40% of closings. And it sounds like you're kind of bracing maybe for a little bit of an incentive war, that's probably too strong of a word, but in the back half of the year in order to generate some volume. So I guess, my question or interpretation of the guidance is it feels like you're not necessarily factoring in that much of an incentive headwind in the back half of the year. So can you just kind of talk through that a little bit?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan, I think Bob's prior answer to Ray's question help to address that. Now I'd combine that with the comment that I made that we're not going to be margin proud. It's important for us to turn our assets, the demand environment and specifically, consumer confidence and affordability has been a little bit choppier. So the combination of a little bit more West Coast mix with a few markets where we think we're going to have to add in a few incremental incentives. We've given kind of some incremental or some more kind of finite range and where we think margins fall in Q4. The guide for Q3, we left unchanged at approximately 29%, and we just put a range around the fourth quarter to accommodate for some of the things that I just described.\nAlan Ratner: Okay. That's helpful. It just seems like it's pretty -- not too dissimilar from the outlook three months ago, even though maybe there's a little bit more conservatism in your outlook from what it sounds like at least in those two states.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Well, Alan, maybe just one other point, I mean, we've got 13,000 units of backlog, the vast majority of which are going to deliver over the next six months. So we could see a lot of that. And to your point about forward incentive load, we already know what the incentives are on those homes. So it's really just --\nAlan Ratner: Got it. Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Second question is just a bit of a bigger picture, higher-level question. Some of your peers have kind of put out reset long-term absorption targets for the business and kind of raise that maybe from where the businesses have run historically. And those are for various reasons, maybe more of a spec mix, more entry level or just kind of just better efficiencies. I'm curious, as you look at your return focus and obviously, the very strong margins, but the commentary about not being margin proud, is there an opportunity longer term to take the absorption run rate of your business higher compared to where it's run historically? And how much margin, if any, do you have to give up to achieve that?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Alan. I think the thing that I would probably reorient the focus would be around how difficult it is to have entitled land in this country. We're in an environment that is largely not in my backyard anti-growth environment both municipalities. So the land that we have entitled and we're able to develop become somewhat of a precious commodity, and we're treating it as such. And we're treating it as such and balancing pace and price to drive the best returns that we can because we fundamentally believe that's what creates shareholder value. And I think the last decade of performance from this company demonstrates just that. Growth is a very important part of our story. And it's part of the reason that in our last quarter, we laid out a multiyear growth target of 5% to 10% over a multiyear period. So for 2024, we're going to be at the higher end of that range for the business that we'll deliver in 2024. And then in my prepared remarks, I highlighted that for 2025, we'd expect to be kind of within that range. So the way we've been investing capital, the way that we've been thinking about kind of community level absorption and total volume deliveries out of the business are very much aligned with that 5% to 10% multi-year growth target. And I'd probably leave it there as opposed to going into by community absorption rates.\nAlan Ratner: Makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Alan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nSam Reid: Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. One more question on Florida here. Just wanted to maybe hear your perspective or your latest perspective, I guess, I should say, on the insurance market. You generally build houses that are further inland obviously, to the latest building codes. But are you finding that higher insurance rates across the state are also potentially a driver behind some of the buyer trepidation there? Just wanted your perspective on that.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Sam, I think it's something that the entire country is grappling with, not just Florida. I think we've seen insurance rates go up in a number of states. Certainly, the issues are maybe more acute in the Florida markets. We are fortunate that we've got our own insurance agency. They do an amazing job. We have high capture rate and they're able to provide, not only provide insurance coverage, but to do it at a very attractive rate for the buyers that are buying in our communities. To your point, our homes are built to the most up-to-date code. They're more resilient, both in terms of building materials, but also in terms of how they handle rain events and kind of rising water type events because of the way that we manage land development, on-site retention, drainage, et cetera. So I think it's not to be dismissed, but it's not something that's having an impact on our ability to sell homes. The other thing that I would kind of highlight at least with a lot of Florida buyers, typically, you've got somebody that already lives in Florida. They're selling the home in Florida, and they might be moving to another location. So they've had insurance. They've been paying on a relative basis, higher insurance rates. And so there's not necessarily a shock there. There's also, as it relates to buyers that are coming in from outside of the State of Florida. They may be on a relative basis to where they're leaving, they might be paying higher rates, but there are other benefits that they might be picking up in terms of lower property tax rates, no state income tax. So there is some -- you don't have to shovel snow and things like that. So there's some puts and takes to insurance rates.\nSam Reid: No, that helps. And then just maybe switching gears and touching on land really quickly here. And this is more of a clarification question. It sounds like you're talking to more of a high single-digit increase in land costs this year. At least that's what's hitting your P&L and flowing through the gross margin. First of all, I just want to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. And then does that represent any change from your earlier your commentary? Because I believe the original expectation was for that to be closer to, let's call it, mid to high single-digits. Just want to make sure we're thinking of that correctly. Thanks.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Yes. Apologies if we weren't clear. We haven't changed our cost estimates for land. I may be guilty of saying high single-digits versus mid to high single-digits. It means the same thing. And I apologize, it's somewhere between 5% and 10%.\nSam Reid: Got you. That helps. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Dahl: Good morning. Thanks and congrats, Bob and Jim. Bob, I guess you're not free of us all quite yet.\nRobert O'Shaughnessy: Not quite yet.\nMichael Dahl: Sometimes. A couple of quick ones from my end. You characterized the July traffic as solid. Obviously, some moving pieces around rates over the past month and then normal seasonality, you would flow. I think your absorption would typically be down kind of mid-teens quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. Just given all the kind of attention from investors and analysts like can you give a little more clarity on kind of how the beginning of 3Q has looked? And are you trying to characterize this as kind of against what was choppy, solid is consistent with what you'd expect that are worth. How would you further clarify that?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Mike, it's always tricky when we're giving qualitative descriptions about three weeks of traffic in July. So we try to choose our words carefully. The second quarter, I think, you've heard from us and you've heard from others that have reported. It was choppy throughout the quarter. But things in early July, three weeks in, have been solid, and we're pleased with kind of how the business is performing. And probably the biggest thing that I'd want you to focus on is kind of our reaffirmation of how we view the business for the entire year, our start rate, what we believe we can deliver and kind of how that sets us up for kind of 2025. So certainly, three weeks of kind of data in July, I know they're important. I know there's a lot of focus on it. But I think the bigger picture of what's the full year of '24 are going to look like, how are we thinking about 2025. Those are the things that I think are probably more important.\nMichael Dahl: Yes. Okay. Understood and fair. And then just sorry to keep going on kind of the Florida and Texas stuff, but just as kind of a level setting exercise. If we look at the orders, your Florida orders were down 9%, your Texas down 8% in the quarter. Is there any way you could give us some additional perspective on in those challenged markets in Southwest Florida and Austin, Dallas? How was the order performance in those markets, specifically in the quarter?\nRyan Marshall: Yes. Mike, the only thing that I'd probably kind of point to there, Bob talked about in his prepared remarks, some of the Del Webb impact in the quarter. Both of those markets are big markets for Del Webb. So beyond some of the community count transition, the community count transition that we're having with some closing and new Del Webbs opening, I wouldn't really go any more granular than that.\nMichael Dahl: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSusan Maklari: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is, you mentioned in your comments that the consumer is a bit more unsure, a bit more cautious. How would you generally characterize the health of them as you come into the third quarter and think about the back half? And what do you think is causing that increased caution? Is there anything that you're hearing from your salespeople on the ground that seems to be a more motivating factor in there for them?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, Susan, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think it's really around two things. One, psychology and consumer confidence. So when rates uptick in early -- kind of early April, I think that had a real impact in kind of the confidence level of consumer when it comes to is now the right time to buy. We do some surveying on our website with prospective buyers when we ask that question. How do you feel about now is a good time to buy. And it was right in that time period that we saw kind of a noticeable change in kind of response to that question. So some of what, I think, is just the rate change and the things that people are hearing in the news and reading in the newspapers. Some of it is impacted by affordability, how much is attributable to one versus the other hard to know. So I think the prospect that potentially rates might come down later in the year. I think that similarly could play into consumer confidence of buyer psychology in a positive way.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. And then you also mentioned that you recently reentered Utah. As you think about the -- your current geographic footprint and hitting that 5% to 10% growth target over time, how do you think about the current markets that you're in, are there more markets that perhaps could fit your profile for some of the products that you offer? And anything else that's interesting to you out there from a market or geographic perspective?\nRyan Marshall: Yes, we're always looking at where is the population going? And are there new growth cities that could create interesting opportunities for us. With the seven markets that we've entered over the last two or three years, I think we've -- we're in all of the markets that we need to be in today. Could there be opportunities down the road? Sure, I never kind of close that off, but we don't have any kind of remaining major growth cities that I think we've got to get into. And then as it relates to kind of the cities that we're in and the growth targets, we're pleased with how all those cities are performing. And they're small, relatively smaller businesses today and kind of our view of growth in those new markets, that's all embedded into our 5% to 10% growth rate.\nSusan Maklari: Okay. Thanks for the color and good luck with everything.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks, Susan.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Thank you. Appreciate everybody's time this morning. We're certainly around and available at the remainder of the day. If you have any questions, please submit them. And otherwise, we will look forward to speaking with you on our next call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. PulteGroup generated second quarter home sale revenues of $4.4 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2023. The increase in revenues for the period was driven by an 8% increase in closings to 8,097 homes, in combination with a 2% increase in our average sales price to $549,000. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in our ASP reflects modest price increases in our first-time and active adult communities, while prices in our move-up communities were consistent with last year. The increase in our average sales prices for the quarter also reflects the impact of mix, as we recorded higher closings within our move-up business, which at $650,000 carried much higher prices than our first-time and active adult business. Broken down by buyer group, closings in the second quarter consisted of 40% first-time, 37% move-up and 23% active adult. This compares with the mix of closings in the second quarter of last year, which was 41% first-time, 34% move-up and 25% active adult. Reflecting the headwinds caused by higher rates and other market dynamics, our 7,649 net new orders were down 4% from last year's exceptionally strong results. In particular, I would highlight that last year's Q2 orders benefited from Del Webb grand opening and built-for-rent sales that are lumpy in nature. As has been well reported, operating conditions in select Florida and Texas markets got more competitive in the second quarter as interest rates rose during the month of April. On our first quarter earnings call this year, we indicated that buyer traffic had slowed during the first few weeks of April and this slowdown did ultimately impact orders as we moved through the period. For the second quarter, our average community count was 934, which is an increase of 3% over the same period last year. The resulting absorption pace of 2.7 orders per community per month in the quarter is above the pre-COVID average, but down from the 2.9 we generated last year. More granularly, our net new orders in the second quarter decreased 3% among first-time buyers, increased 4% among move-up buyers, and decreased 17% among active adult buyers. While we continue to see strong demand among active adult buyers, we did report a larger year-over-year decrease in their second quarter quarters. That decrease primarily reflects lower community count in the current year and some impact from the timing of openings and closings of several of our Del Webb communities. Adjusting for the impact of these dynamics, our net new orders at stores that were operating consistently in both periods shows an order decrease of only 3%. Consistent with our overall order results, on a unit basis, our quarter end backlog was down 4% to 12,982 homes, although backlog value was down only 1% to $8.1 billion. Turning to production. We started at approximately 8,100 homes in the second quarter and ended the quarter with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Of the 17,250 homes under construction, approximately 6,900 or 40% of spec, including an average of 1.3 finished specs per community. These levels are in line with our targets of 40% and one finished spec per community and put us in a position to meet our delivery targets over the balance of the year. As always, we are prepared to adjust our cadence of spec starts up or down in response to sustained changes in overall higher demand. Based on the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we currently expect to close between 7,400 and 7,800 homes in the third quarter and continue to expect to close approximately 31,000 homes for the full year. As noted, we realized an average sales price of $549,000 in the second quarter, which is consistent with our prior guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Looking ahead, we expect closings in the third and fourth quarters to be in that same range of $540,000 to $550,000. While our average price and backlog is higher than our guide, we have a lot of homes left to sell and close this year, most of which will be spec production with our first-time buyer communities where pricing is lower. We reported second quarter gross margin of 29.9%, which represents an increase of 30 basis points over both the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. As in Q1 of this year, our reported gross margins reflect a favorable mix of closings and a generally supportive pricing environment for many of the spec sales we closed in the quarter. Second quarter gross margins also benefited from opportunities we've taken in prior quarters to improve net pricing in a number of communities across our portfolio. Consistent with such actions, incentives on closings in the second quarter was 6.3% selling price, which is down from 6.5% in the first quarter of this year. While recent macro data has sparked optimism about the potential for Fed rate cuts, we don't factor such expectations into our guidance. What we do know is that rates remain elevated, affordability is stretched, and our delivery mix will be less favorable in the back half of the year. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, in the third and fourth quarters, we will be closing more homes in our West region, where homes carry a lower relative margin profile than we did in the first half of the year. These factors, combined with our need to be price competitive to turn assets point to an expected gross margin of approximately 29% in the third quarter and 28.5% to 29% in the fourth quarter. As stated previously, we still have homes to sell and close to meet our full-year delivery guide of 31,000 units. So, demand conditions over the next few months can have an impact on the results built. In the second quarter, our reported SG&A expense was $361 million, or 8.1% of home sale revenues. Reported SG&A includes a $52 million pre-tax insurance benefit recorded in the period. In Q2 of last year, our reported SG&A expense was $315 million, or 7.8% of home sale revenue, which includes a $65 billion pre-tax insurance benefit. Excluding the impact of the insurance benefits recorded in the first two quarters of this year, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Turning to our financial services operations. We reported pre-tax income of $63 million in the second quarter, which is up from $46 million in the same period last year. The 36% increase in pre-tax income reflects strong financial performance across all business lines, including mortgage, title and insurance. Our performance also benefited from an increase in capture rates across all business lines, including a mortgage capture rate of 86% in the quarter, up from 80% last year. In total, reported pre-tax income for the second quarter was $1 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over last year. Our tax expense in the second quarter was $239 million, with an effective tax rate of 22.8%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter includes the benefit of energy tax credits and a $13 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. For the remaining quarters this year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Taken altogether, we reported net income of $809 million or $3.83 per share. This compares to prior year reported net income of $720 million, or $3.21 per share. On a per share basis, we continue to benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, which on a year-over-year basis reduced shares outstanding by 5% from last year. Capitalizing on our strong cash flows, we continue to support the future growth of our business as we invested approximately $1.2 billion in land acquisition and development in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date land spend to just over $2.3 billion, keeping us on track to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year. For both the quarter and the first six months of 2024, the allocation of land spend was 60% development and 40% acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 225,000 lots under control, of which 53% were held via option. Given the strength of our land pipeline, we continue to forecast community count growth of 3% to 5% in the third and fourth quarters of this year over the comparable prior periods last year. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are also continuing to return capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million common shares at a cost of $314 million, or an average price of $113.79 per share. This brings our year-to-date share repurchase activity to a total of 5.1 million shares repurchased at a cost of $560 million or $110.58 per share. In addition to repurchasing stock, we also completed a tender offer for $300 million of our senior notes in the second quarter. As a result, our debt-to-capital ratio is now just 12.8% and our notes payable have decreased to $1.7 billion, which represents the lowest level since before we acquired Del Webb in 2001. After spending more than $1.8 billion during the quarter on land investment and the purchase of our equity and debt, we ended the quarter with more than $1.4 billion of cash. Adjusting for our cash position, our net debt-to-capital ratio at the quarter end was 1.8%. I'm also pleased to report that in acknowledgement of our improved operations, strong cash flow generation and outstanding balance sheet, Fitch recently upgraded our debt to BBB+, while Moody's upgraded its outlook to positive. Now, let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. It's a great question, Stephen. So, cycle time days in the quarter on closings were 123 days. So, that's a pickup of about a week from where we were in Q1. I would say, today, we've got a number of divisions where the cycle times are at or below kind of that 100-day target that we've set for ourselves. But we do still have some divisions where it's elevated. I see trade availability is probably what's holding some of those divisions back. Looking forward, as we look to the end of the year, we'll probably be slightly elevated over that 100-day target that we set. But we're working hard and we think we can get there in the first half of '25. One thing I might add to that. It's worth it to remember if they're selling a home more often than not, that's also a buyer. So it's not really net supply add to the market. It can influence pricing as much as anything else. And retail has always been our biggest competitor. We always have -- we have the advantage today of being able to offer rate incentives to the buyers. So for the demand that's there, we are a compelling choice first of that resale inventory. Well, certainly, our cash flow guide is still current. And I think we've historically not given a view as to how much we're going to be repurchasing in the forward periods. We've let our kind of actions speak for themselves. You can and should expect to see us continue to be in market. Yes. It's an interesting question and I wish I had a perfect answer for you, but a lot of it will depend on what is prompting that decline in rates, right? We've talked about this before. If the economy is healthy, lower rates are good because it means that the consumer's wallet is still healthy and they still have a job and the lower interest rate environment allows them to save some money. I think in that environment, we would expect to see margins a tailwind because our incentive load likely goes down. If it is in concert with that, we're worried about recessionary impacts, GDP, not healthy jobs, not as solid as they are today. That has another influence. The other thing that factors into this is supply, right? We talked about it in some markets. It's a little bit more competitive. And so there could be a scenario where we've made it clear we want to sell homes, and we're going to find the price that's going to get there. While we may be able to save a little bit of money on the incentive for the financing, we may be in a position where we're giving some of that in some other form of incentive. So like I said, I don't know, Ryan, if you want to comment, but the broader environment is important to that is just what happened to rates. We've always said rates are interesting, but they are only one element of the consumer equation. So the stick and brick costs in the second quarter were $80 per square foot. That's flat with the first quarter of this year. As we look ahead, we expect inflation to be manageable maybe low single-digits over the balance of the year backing us. Maybe worth highlighting I think Jim's referencing primarily vertical. The land costs, we've talked about kind of high single-digit increases through '24 also embedded in that guide. Yes. Maybe just one point of clarification. I'd rather we're speaking to the IRR on the transaction as opposed to our return on equity. Like our equity gets influenced by lots of other things ultimately when you kind of get to the parent level. But on a deal-by-deal basis, banks versus nonbank, it is roughly a 200 to 300 basis point cost and margin and then a roughly 200 to 300 basis point benefit to the return on that transaction. No, other than that furthering Ryan's point, as we get a more efficiently on pipeline, i.e., more optionality, I think, we get to a point where our cash flows better match our earnings. So less of the cyclicality on the balance sheet and the impact on cash flows from inventory changes, which is that the environment we operate today is going to generate a lot of cash. So it's not likely that we would be levering from here. Yes. It's really a combination of two primary things. One is it's the mix that we've highlighted. And to a degree, we saw that coming. So it was in the 29 area that we had given back at the end of the first quarter, but that has continued. So we've got a bigger mix kind of number than we saw 90 days ago. And really, we've highlighted the market's gotten a little bit choppier and so we see that there's likely to be a little bit more incentive. We told you we've got homes to sell and close. And so we're projecting that into our guide as well. I think it's worth highlighting the range that we've given now is a little bit lower, but it includes that same point that we had been at the beginning -- at the end of the first quarter. So I don't want anybody to misconstrue. We don't see a big change in market. This is really just kind of circumstance driven. Well, Alan, maybe just one other point, I mean, we've got 13,000 units of backlog, the vast majority of which are going to deliver over the next six months. So we could see a lot of that. And to your point about forward incentive load, we already know what the incentives are on those homes. So it's really just -- Yes. Apologies if we weren't clear. We haven't changed our cost estimates for land. I may be guilty of saying high single-digits versus mid to high single-digits. It means the same thing. And I apologize, it's somewhere between 5% and 10%. Not quite yet."

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. PulteGroup delivered another quarter of strong financial results, which reflect an approach to the business in which we seek to balance price, pace and investment over the long-term to generate superior returns. Consistent with this strategy, our financial results continue to show the power of capitalizing on the value of each lot and home we sell. Our divisions work extremely hard to secure, entitle and develop our land assets and work equally hard to generate exceptional profitability, while still turning our portfolio at an appropriate rate. Specific to our second quarter performance, we realized a 2% increase in average sales price, an 8% increase in closings, and a 30 basis point gain in gross margin, which in aggregate, helped drive a 19% increase in earnings to a second quarter record of $3.83 per share. Another quarter of overall strong financial performance, highlighted by our double-digit earnings growth, resulted in PulteGroup generating a return on equity of 27.1% for the trailing 12-month period. Obviously, a key driver of our strong financial results and high returns on invested capital continues to be the company's outstanding gross margins. As Bob will discuss, gross margins in the period benefited from a favorable mix of closings, but I would also highlight the pricing strength evident in our numbers. In Q2, product options and lot premiums averaged $104,000 per home and represented approximately 19% of our average sales price of $549,000. As I'm sure you can all appreciate, options and lot premiums are high-margin dollars and an important contributor to PulteGroup's outsized margins relative to peers. I know how hard our employees work to deliver such outstanding results and I want to thank our entire organization for their efforts. As good as our second quarter numbers are, it's fair to say that as we navigated through the period, demand was a little less consistent than we experienced in the first quarter of 2024. On our Q1 earnings call, we noted buyer traffic had slowed the first few weeks of April. While subsequent Wall Street channel checks confirmed a change in short-term demand, the fact remains that we are operating in a housing market that has been underbuilt relative to population, immigration and household formation for more than a decade. The resulting housing deficit of several million homes is likely a structural reality for years to come, given the zoning challenges we face in most municipalities. Our country's underlying new home supply issue has been exacerbated by the lock-in effect caused by the dramatic rise in interest rates over the last two years. What the market continues to experience is existing homeowners who are unwilling or more likely unable to give up the low rate mortgages originated several years ago. As a consequence, the inventory of quality existing homes remains below long-term averages in many markets. The supply imbalance is one of the reasons that I am confident in the long-term demand trends for housing in this country, but I'd appreciate that buyer demand will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For example, the bump in interest rates in the second quarter caused some buyers to become more cautious, while others saw affordability stretched beyond their financial capacity. While many cities are facing a limited supply of homes for sale, we have seen an increase in existing and new home supply in select markets in Florida and Texas. These markets are now in the process of finding the new clearing price needed to work down any excess inventory. Maybe more impactful than rates and inventory, the feedback we are getting points to a lack of confidence among some consumers that now is a good time to buy. High prices, higher interest rates and the resulting high monthly payments are making potential buyers more cautious in purchasing a new home. To the degree that this lack of confidence among consumers reflects affordability concerns, this isn't new, and in fact, it's something we address on a market-by-market, even community-by-community basis every day. It was more than a year ago that you first heard me say that delivering high returns requires that we turn our assets and that we won't be margin proud. In an environment where market conditions are more competitive, we have worked to ensure that our products, prices and incentives are clearly meeting buyer needs. Consistent with this focus on turning our assets, we continue to build a more efficient and faster turning land pipeline. In the quarter, lots controlled via option increased to 53% of total lots. We are successfully building on our historic base of lots option directly with the land sellers by increasing our use of third-party land bankers. To-date, we have entered into transactions representing almost 13,000 lots and $1.5 billion of capital. As with all land-related activities, we are being disciplined in how we expand this part of our portfolio, but we are making steady progress in assembling a more efficient land pipeline. As we sit here at the midpoint of 2024, I would say that it is shaping up to be a very good year for Pulte. Relative to our expectations coming into 2024, not only did we raise our initial closing guide by 1,000 homes, but we are clearly on a gross margin path well above our initial guide. For various reasons, market conditions got a little tougher in the second quarter, but we continue to actively manage price, pace and starts to drive the best business outcome. Based on the current demand conditions and construction cycle times, we continue to start homes at a pace consistent with closing 31,000 homes this year, as well as positioning the company to grow 5% to 10% in 2025, consistent with the multiyear outlook we have discussed previously. Through the first few weeks of July, traffic to our communities has been solid, but depending on how demand conditions and absorption paces evolve up or down in each market over the balance of the year, we will adjust our starts pace as needed. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our second quarter results. Thanks, Bob. During the first half of 2024, traffic to our communities was good and absorption pace ran slightly above historic norms. So, I feel good about our opportunities in the back half of the year. To the degree that the Fed actually cuts interest rates in the coming months, I think that will provide a powerful tailwind both financially and psychologically as we enter 2025. Before turning the call back to Jim, I would draw your attention to a release we issued a couple of weeks ago about one of our newest community openings and our first in Utah in more than 20 years. Along with representing PulteGroup's reentry into my home state, Utah is the seventh greenfield new market entry we have initiated over the past few years. Through the first half of 2024, we increased home sale revenues by 10% and grew reported earnings per share by 25% over the last year. Over the same period, we increased our land investment by 31% to $2.3 billion, while increasing year-to-date share repurchases and dividend payments by 37% to $645 million. We also retired $300 million of debt. PulteGroup has executed extremely well and with expectations of closing 31,000 homes for the full year, we are in excellent position to drive strong results going forward. And finally, before opening the call to questions, I want to briefly address the press release we issued yesterday announcing our CFO succession plans. After a truly impactful 13-year career with PulteGroup, Bob O'Shaughnessy has initiated a transition toward retirement at the end of 2025. Step one in this process is that Bob will relinquish his title as Chief Financial Officer effective early February of next year. I'm pleased to say that Bob will then remain with us for another 10 months as Executive Vice President. During that time, he will support a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities, as well as continue to oversee our financial services business, our strategic partnerships and our asset management committee. Since its founding, PulteGroup's greatest strength has always been the talented people who work here. Reflecting this depth of exceptional people, I'm proud to announce that Jim Ossowski, currently Senior Vice President of Finance, has been named as the company's next CFO. Jim has had an outstanding 22-year career at PulteGroup, during which time he has served as VP of Finance and Corporate Controller, VP of Finance, Homebuilding Operations, Area VP of Finance and Director of Corporate Audit. In his current role as SVP of Finance, he manages our critical asset management committee and FP&A function. Jim has been promoted to Executive Vice President and CFO effective February of 2025. At that time, Jim will report directly to me and will have responsibility for our accounting, tax, audit, risk management and treasury functions. In announcing these changes now, we ensure having plenty of time to implement a seamless transition of responsibilities. Now, let me turn the call back to Jim. Yeah. Stephen, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. Maybe the first part of the question about the margin in the balance of the year related to the West. We mentioned last quarter and it's continued into this quarter. The West has performed better than it had in kind of prior periods. So, we've got a heavier mix of West Coast closings coming through. Those margins on a relative basis are a little bit lower. And so we've factored that into the margin guide that we've given for Q3 and Q4. The margins are, I think, you'll agree, incredibly, incredibly strong at the levels that we've guided to. As it relates to land banking, we're making great progress. The goal that we've kind of laid out is to get from the historical 50% options that we've been running at to 70%. That incremental kind of 20% move was going to be done with land bankers. I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're making great progress. It's steady, it's deliberate, and we're absolutely on the path to get to 70%. In terms of the trade between margin and return, that's what we typically look at is we're looking. What we're ultimately looking for is we're looking for transfer of risk. And with that, we typically see somewhere between 200 basis points to 300 basis point trade between margin and return. Every deal is unique. So to paint it with any more of a broad brush than that, I think wouldn't be fair. And then the closing comment I'd make is -- and I know you know this, Stephen, but we underwrite return, not the margins. Return is what we believe ultimately drives shareholder value. Stephen, it's Ryan again. I'll take the ICG question. We're pleased with how ICG is performing. We've got two active plants, both located in the Southeast part of the US. They do a mix of our business, along with other single-family homebuilder business. And we have a decent amount of commercial business that runs through those plants as well, predominantly in the frame package for apartments. If there was a part of the ICG business that's lagging, it would be that commercial business with the slowdown in new apartment development or new apartment projects starting. We do have a physical location secured and owned. Actually, more than secured. We own a location for our third ICG plant. We have not started construction on that yet. We're just finalizing some of the design parameters for that new location. So as we have more details on that, we'll be sure to share it. We're pleased with not only the cycle time benefits that we get out of ICG, the quality pickups, better safety. We also think we get better cost just in the way that we're able to buy, particularly lumber as it flows into the ICG plant. So happy with how that business is performing. Yeah, John, it's a good question. Probably the one market that's higher than what we'd ideally like to see would be Southwest Florida. There we've seen inventory -- resale inventory levels approach about nine months, with the benchmark or the kind of equilibrium rate being six months. So, we're a tad elevated. I wouldn't consider it concerning. That's been a very strong market for a long time. I think it continues to be a really desirable place for retirees and second homeowners. So, I think that market had unprecedented price appreciation. Part of the reason that I think we're seeing some of the elevated inventory levels. The market will go through a bit of an adjustment. It will find a clearing price and I'd expect inventory levels to come back to kind of a more normal range. There are a few markets in Texas that I think are in similar situation. Austin, Dallas would be the two that I would probably highlight. That I have also seen unprecedented growth in population, jobs, and resulting home price increases. But other than the nine months of inventory in Southwest Florida, there's probably nothing that I'd characterize as concerning. Hey, Mike, it's Ryan. I think the way you've articulated is accurate. So I think you're understanding it right. I would reiterate that the 50% that we have in our business today of land options. Those are land options with the underlying seller and that's been the case for the last seven or eight years. So that's not a change. And going forward, we'd expect that to remain in that kind of 50-ish percent range. So the incremental optionality taking us from 50 to 70, that's the piece that will have more land banking in it. Yes, Mike, the way that I'd ask you to think about capital allocation is we look at the needs of the business first and foremost. And that starts with how much investment do we want to put into land? How much investment do we want to put into dividends? How much investment do we want to put into share repo and as evidenced in over the last couple of years, we've even been retiring debt. So we look at the collective needs of the business and then we think about how are we going to finance that. The business is performing incredibly well, and we've been generating great cash flow and that cash flow put us in a very favorable position where we haven't needed the levels of debt that we've historically used in the business. So I think we can all agree that having an appropriate amount of leverage in a business is advantageous and efficient from a return standpoint. That's part of the reason that we set kind of our target rate at 20% to 30%. But we're not going to let the tail wag the dog here. We look at how we want to run the business, think about the capital that we need for that and then we look at how we're going to finance it. And in the position that we're in, we're in a great position to have lower leverage, lower debt and still do all of the things that we want to do strategically from an investment standpoint. So I take the position that we're in from an overall debt level any day of the week and twice on Sunday. Could the business absorb or handle more debt certainly but again, the number one priority is how do we want to run the business and then we go figure out how to finance it. Bob, anything else do you want to add to that? Yes, Rafe, thanks for the question. I think what's created some of the increase in inventory is the unprecedented rise in price, which has caused some owners to become sellers for whatever reason. Those high prices have created a bit of an affordability challenge that prospective buyers are struggling to kind of digest at this point. So as I mentioned on one of the prior questions, I think what happens here, there'll be a little bit of a kind of price market clearing price adjustment process that will happen over time. I think it takes a terribly long time. But over the next probably three, six, nine months, I would expect that market to kind of work through some of the buildup of inventory. I'd point you to as an example, Austin. If you looked at the Austin market going back probably two years ago, a couple of years post-COVID unprecedented job growth, combined with unprecedented rise in sales prices, all of a sudden, the market kind of came to a bit of a slowdown. We saw build in inventory. It took about six months for the market to kind of work through some of that inventory and it settled back into kind of a more normal run rate growth rate. So my expectation would be probably for something similar to happen as it relates to Southwest Florida. Thanks, Rafe. Yes, Alan, I think Bob's prior answer to Ray's question help to address that. Now I'd combine that with the comment that I made that we're not going to be margin proud. It's important for us to turn our assets, the demand environment and specifically, consumer confidence and affordability has been a little bit choppier. So the combination of a little bit more West Coast mix with a few markets where we think we're going to have to add in a few incremental incentives. We've given kind of some incremental or some more kind of finite range and where we think margins fall in Q4. The guide for Q3, we left unchanged at approximately 29%, and we just put a range around the fourth quarter to accommodate for some of the things that I just described. Yes, Alan. I think the thing that I would probably reorient the focus would be around how difficult it is to have entitled land in this country. We're in an environment that is largely not in my backyard anti-growth environment both municipalities. So the land that we have entitled and we're able to develop become somewhat of a precious commodity, and we're treating it as such. And we're treating it as such and balancing pace and price to drive the best returns that we can because we fundamentally believe that's what creates shareholder value. And I think the last decade of performance from this company demonstrates just that. Growth is a very important part of our story. And it's part of the reason that in our last quarter, we laid out a multiyear growth target of 5% to 10% over a multiyear period. So for 2024, we're going to be at the higher end of that range for the business that we'll deliver in 2024. And then in my prepared remarks, I highlighted that for 2025, we'd expect to be kind of within that range. So the way we've been investing capital, the way that we've been thinking about kind of community level absorption and total volume deliveries out of the business are very much aligned with that 5% to 10% multi-year growth target. And I'd probably leave it there as opposed to going into by community absorption rates. Thanks, Alan. Yes, Sam, I think it's something that the entire country is grappling with, not just Florida. I think we've seen insurance rates go up in a number of states. Certainly, the issues are maybe more acute in the Florida markets. We are fortunate that we've got our own insurance agency. They do an amazing job. We have high capture rate and they're able to provide, not only provide insurance coverage, but to do it at a very attractive rate for the buyers that are buying in our communities. To your point, our homes are built to the most up-to-date code. They're more resilient, both in terms of building materials, but also in terms of how they handle rain events and kind of rising water type events because of the way that we manage land development, on-site retention, drainage, et cetera. So I think it's not to be dismissed, but it's not something that's having an impact on our ability to sell homes. The other thing that I would kind of highlight at least with a lot of Florida buyers, typically, you've got somebody that already lives in Florida. They're selling the home in Florida, and they might be moving to another location. So they've had insurance. They've been paying on a relative basis, higher insurance rates. And so there's not necessarily a shock there. There's also, as it relates to buyers that are coming in from outside of the State of Florida. They may be on a relative basis to where they're leaving, they might be paying higher rates, but there are other benefits that they might be picking up in terms of lower property tax rates, no state income tax. So there is some -- you don't have to shovel snow and things like that. So there's some puts and takes to insurance rates. Yes, Mike, it's always tricky when we're giving qualitative descriptions about three weeks of traffic in July. So we try to choose our words carefully. The second quarter, I think, you've heard from us and you've heard from others that have reported. It was choppy throughout the quarter. But things in early July, three weeks in, have been solid, and we're pleased with kind of how the business is performing. And probably the biggest thing that I'd want you to focus on is kind of our reaffirmation of how we view the business for the entire year, our start rate, what we believe we can deliver and kind of how that sets us up for kind of 2025. So certainly, three weeks of kind of data in July, I know they're important. I know there's a lot of focus on it. But I think the bigger picture of what's the full year of '24 are going to look like, how are we thinking about 2025. Those are the things that I think are probably more important. Yes. Mike, the only thing that I'd probably kind of point to there, Bob talked about in his prepared remarks, some of the Del Webb impact in the quarter. Both of those markets are big markets for Del Webb. So beyond some of the community count transition, the community count transition that we're having with some closing and new Del Webbs opening, I wouldn't really go any more granular than that. Yes, Susan, good morning. Thanks for the question. I think it's really around two things. One, psychology and consumer confidence. So when rates uptick in early -- kind of early April, I think that had a real impact in kind of the confidence level of consumer when it comes to is now the right time to buy. We do some surveying on our website with prospective buyers when we ask that question. How do you feel about now is a good time to buy. And it was right in that time period that we saw kind of a noticeable change in kind of response to that question. So some of what, I think, is just the rate change and the things that people are hearing in the news and reading in the newspapers. Some of it is impacted by affordability, how much is attributable to one versus the other hard to know. So I think the prospect that potentially rates might come down later in the year. I think that similarly could play into consumer confidence of buyer psychology in a positive way. Yes, we're always looking at where is the population going? And are there new growth cities that could create interesting opportunities for us. With the seven markets that we've entered over the last two or three years, I think we've -- we're in all of the markets that we need to be in today. Could there be opportunities down the road? Sure, I never kind of close that off, but we don't have any kind of remaining major growth cities that I think we've got to get into. And then as it relates to kind of the cities that we're in and the growth targets, we're pleased with how all those cities are performing. And they're small, relatively smaller businesses today and kind of our view of growth in those new markets, that's all embedded into our 5% to 10% growth rate. Thanks, Susan."

Q1 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star, one again. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer. You may begin.\nJames Zeumer: Great, thanks Jeannie. Good morning. Let me welcome everyone to today\u2019s call. We look forward to discussing PulteGroup\u2019s outstanding Q1 operating and financial results for the period ended March 31, 2024. I\u2019m joined on the call today by Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; Bob O\u2019Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior VP, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning\u2019s presentation slides has been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We\u2019ll post an audio replay of this call later today. We want to alert everyone that today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments made today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today\u2019s earnings release and within the accompanying presentation slides. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Jim, and good morning. As you read in this morning\u2019s press release, PulteGroup reported record first quarter results across many of our key financial metrics. From top line revenues of $3.8 billion and gross margins of 29.6% to bottom line earnings of $3.10 per share, it was an exceptional quarter. These strong first quarter results helped to drive a return on equity of 27.3% for the trailing 12-month period. Our strong first quarter results reflect long-term strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation process that have underpinned PulteGroup\u2019s success for more than a decade. I would suggest that another driver of our record Q1 results are decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year, decisions that I think are emblematic of the balanced approach we take to running our business and to delivering high returns. On our last earnings call, we talked about decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year to not lower our prices in a chase for volume. As you will recall, demand in the fourth quarter of 2023 had started slowly but improved as interest rates began to moderate. As we made the decision to push incentives aggressively as the quarter progressed, we likely could have delivered higher closing volumes in \u201923. With demand improving in the fourth quarter, we elected to hold our pricing and have had more inventory available for the 2024 spring selling season. The result of this decision is that we were in a position to sell and close more homes in the first quarter of 2024, and at higher margins. That\u2019s what you see in our Q1 results - closings and gross margins above our guide as demand dynamics allowed us to sell more homes with better net pricing. When buyer demand is rising, we\u2019re often asked how many more homes we can sell given the value we place on entitled loss and our focus on driving high returns. More volume is not the only answer as we work to balance pace and price to drive high returns. Within our operating model, stronger demand provides choices: we can sell more houses or we can raise prices, or as was the case in the first quarter, we can do both. What we experienced in the first quarter is that areas of strong demand last year, such as the southeast, Florida and Texas, continued to perform well into 2024. Even more positive is that areas that had some struggles in 2023, notably Arizona, California and Nevada, were much improved in 2024. Consistent with the favorable conditions in the first quarter, almost all our markets displayed pricing dynamics that were stable or improving, which allowed us to raise net pricing in more than half of our communities. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times, our pricing decisions are made with a goal of delivering high returns and the best overall business outcomes. Depending upon the community and the buyer\u2019s wants and needs, we may have raised base prices or lowered incentives, the result being that net pricing in the quarter across many of our markets was up between 1% and 5%. The impact of these actions on our business performance is powerful. As Bob will discuss, we are increasing guidance for both full-year closings and gross margins. Against generally favorable demand conditions, the supply of available housing remains tight. We have a long-term structural issue resulting from a decade of under-building that has the country short approximately 4 million housing units. At the same time, the available inventory of existing homes for sale continues to be low as homeowners remain locked into their low mortgage rates. Life happens, so we are seeing some additional existing homes come to market, but the numbers remain well below historic rates. As a homebuilder, this is a great operating environment as we are supplying a product that a lot of people need and want. I appreciate, however, that our country\u2019s housing shortage can create hardships for today\u2019s consumers as the lack of supply keeps housing prices high. In fact, some of our recent buyers said that they made the decision to buy now because they couldn\u2019t wait any longer for rates to roll back. In a market where home prices are high and because of limited inventory, they will likely continue moving higher. Our company\u2019s ability to offer targeted incentives, particularly mortgage rate buy-downs, is a powerful tool that can help bridge the affordability gap. For example, in the first quarter, approximately 25% of our home buyers used our national rate program. In a world where the consensus is that interest rates will be higher for longer, our interest rate incentives likely become an even greater competitive advantage, especially relative to the existing home seller. Higher interest rates create additional challenges for today\u2019s home buyers, but we appreciate that rates are moving higher because of a resilient economy and a strong job market. Given these conditions, we are optimistic about 2024 and PulteGroup\u2019s ability to continue delivering strong financial results. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our first quarter results. Bob?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thanks Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan noted, the company delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter, which have us well positioned to realize outstanding financial performance throughout 2024. In the first quarter, we reported home sale revenues of $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Higher revenues in the period were driven by an 11% increase in closings to 7,095 homes, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average sales price of $538,000. The lower closing price compared to the first quarter of last year reflects a shift in the geographic mix of homes closed as we realized relatively higher closings from our southeast and Florida markets with more modest increases in our higher priced western markets. Closings in the quarter came in above our guide as we had available spec inventory to meet the strong buyer demand we experienced this period. As Ryan highlighted, by choosing not to chase volume in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we had additional inventory in Q1 that we were able to sell and close with better margins due to the improving buyer demand activity in the quarter. Our spec production is predominantly within our first-time buyer communities, so on a year-over-year basis we realized increased closings from first-time buyers. In the quarter, our closing mix included 41% first-time, 36% move-up, and 23% active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the mix of closings consisted of 38% first-time, 36% move-up, and 26% active adult. Reflecting the favorable demand conditions we experienced in the first quarter, net new orders increased 14% over last year to 8,379 homes. In the quarter, we realized a year-over-year increase in gross orders and a reduction in cancellation rates. Cancellations as a percentage of starting backlog fell to 10.1%, down from 12.7% in the first quarter last year. Average community count for our first quarter was 931, which is an increase of 6% over the prior year and in line with our guidance for year-over-year community count growth of 3% to 5%. The resulting absorption pace of approximately three homes per month for the quarter was above our historic average for the period, excluding the pandemic-impacted years of \u201921 and \u201922. I would also like to highlight that orders in the quarter were higher across all buyer groups, which is another sign of the overall strength of the market. More specifically, net new orders among first-time buyers increased 8%, move-up increased 22%, and active adult increased 12%. Consistent with earlier comments, the large increase in orders among move-up buyers was influenced by improving market conditions in the west, where our business mix is much more heavily weighted towards move-up. Given this strong start to our spring selling season, our quarter-end backlog increased to 13,430 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. We started approximately 7,500 homes in the quarter and ended the period with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Our production pipeline includes approximately 7,000 or 41% spec homes, of which 1,337 are completed. We are operating just above our target of one finished spec per community but believe carrying a few more finished specs was the right strategy, given buyers\u2019 preferences and the fact that we are still in the more active spring selling season. Given the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to close between 7,800 and 8,200 homes in the second quarter. With the strong start to the year in both orders and closings, we are raising our guide for full-year closings to approximately 31,000 homes. This would represent an 8% increase over 2023, which is the higher end of our long-term goal of growing our closing volume between 5% and 10% annually. Closings in the first quarter had an average sales price of $538,000, which was slightly below our guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Relative to our guide, pricing in the quarter was influenced by the geographic mix of closings along with a higher volume of spec homes closed in the period. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect the mix of homes closed in each quarter will result in ASPs consistent with our prior guide of $540,000 to $550,000. For the first quarter, we reported a gross margin of 29.6%, which is an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of \u201923 and a sequential gain of 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of \u201923. At 29.6%, our first quarter gross margin was also notably higher than our guide. Beyond Ryan\u2019s comments that we are achieving higher returns by actively managing both pace and price, mix had an impacted on our reported Q1 margins. Higher demand increased as the quarter advanced, which allowed us to sell and close more homes in the period than forecast. On a relative basis, more of these closings occurred in our higher margin markets in the southeast and Florida, resulting in a meaningful increase in reported gross margins for the quarter. Based on Q1 sign-ups and the composition of our backlog, we expect the geographic mix of closings to be more balanced as we move through the remainder of the year. That being said, we\u2019re raising our gross margin guide for the remainder of \u201924. We had previously guided to quarterly gross margins of 28% to 28.5%, but we now expect gross margins in the second quarter to be approximately 29.2%. Based on current backlog, we would expect gross margins for our third and fourth quarters to be approximately 29%, but we still have homes to sell and close, so demand conditions over the coming months will impact the results we ultimately report. Beyond buyer demand and near-term pricing dynamics, the gross margin guide for the remainder of \u201924 also reflects expected changes in the geographic mix of homes we expect to close. Given recent sign-up trends, we anticipate closing more homes in our west region, which currently have a lower relative margin profile due to the fact that we adjusted pricing in these markets over the course of \u201923 to achieve appropriate sales pace. Looking at our costs, reported SG&A in the first quarter was $358 million or 9.4% of home sale revenues. As noted in our press release, our reported SG&A for the period includes a $27 million pre-tax insurance benefit. SG&A in the first quarter of \u201923 was $337 million of 9.6% of home sale revenues. Consistent with our previous guide, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Based on normal seasonality, we expect to realize increased overhead leverage as we move through the remaining quarters of the year. Our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $41 million for the first quarter, which is an increase of almost 200% from last year\u2019s pre-tax income of $14 million. The increase in Q1 pre-tax income was driven by better market conditions across our financial services platform. Financial services also benefited from higher capture rates across all business lines, including an increase to 84%, up from 78% last year in our mortgage operations. As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, in the first quarter we completed the sale of a joint venture that resulted in a gain of $38 million. On our income statement, this gain was recorded in equity income from unconsolidated entities. Our reported first quarter pre-tax income was period record of $869 million, an increase of 24% over last year. Against that, we reported tax expense of $206 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. Our reported Q1 tax rate was impacted by energy tax credits and stock compensation deductions recorded in the period. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In total, our reported Q1 net income was $663 million or $3.10 per share, compared with prior year reported net income of $533 million or $2.35 per share. Earnings per share in our most recent quarter benefited from a 6% reduction in share count compared with the prior year as we continue to systematically repurchase our stock. Moving past the income statement, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the first quarter. Consistent with our recent land activity, 60% of our land spend in the quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Our Q1 land spend keeps us on track with our plans to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year, of which we continue to expect about 60% will be for development with the remainder for the acquisition of new land positions. We ended the quarter with approximately 220,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The purchase of several large land positions in combination with the decision not to move forward with a few option transactions during the quarter lowered our lot option percentage from the end of 2023. I would highlight, however, that 74% of the lots we had pre-approved in this most recent quarter were under option. As our first quarter numbers indicate, we continue to work toward our multi-year goal of controlling 70% of our land by buying via option. Looking at our community count, we continue to expect average community count for 2024 to increase 3% to 5% in each quarter over the comparable prior year period. Along with investing in our business, we continue to return capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million common shares at a cost of $246 million for an average price of $106.73 per share. In the quarter, we also opportunistically purchased approximately $10 million of our outstanding bonds. After allocating approximately $1.4 billion to investments and the return of funds to shareholders, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash. Taking all of this into account, our quarter-end gross debt to capital ratio was 15.4%, while our net debt to capital ratio was only 1.7%. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Bob. As you would expect, given the strength of our first quarter results, buyer interest was high in the period as order paces increased beyond typical seasonality. That sales momentum continued into April, although we are now seeing some moderation of traffic into our communities due to the recent increases in interest rates, particularly within the Centex brand. While the change is relatively modest and based on a limited number of days, consumer feedback suggests that higher rates are causing some buyers to evaluate the timing of their activity due to the volatile interest rate environment. We\u2019ll continue to monitor how buyers respond to changes in the rate environment and are prepared to adjust pricing or incentives to ensure we are appropriately turning assets. During our last earnings call, we talked about the opportunity for PulteGroup to grow its business 5% to 10% annually. Given the lengthy land investment process, organic change in this industry takes time to accomplish, but we have been systematically planning and positioning to deliver against this goal for the past few years. I think that the company\u2019s efforts are reflected in the allocation of capital into growing our business. Including our Q1 spend, since 2021 our operating teams have invested approximately $14 billion in land acquisition and development, with plans to invest another $5 billion in 2024. Along with the land, we have been investing in our people and working to ensure the needed trade capacity is available to support our expanding operations. I\u2019m proud to say that we have accomplished this while adhering to the same underwriting hurdles and investment disciplines which have been the cornerstone of PulteGroup for the past decade. Such discipline has allowed PulteGroup to more consistently grow its earnings, drive substantial cash flow from operations and deliver high returns, we have accomplished this while maintaining the superior build quality and customer experience which PulteGroup home buyers have come to expect. Before opening the call to questions, I want to take a minute to recognize and celebrate our team for once again being named a Fortune 100 Best Company to Work For. What makes this recognition so important and gratifying is that it\u2019s based on feedback from all of our employees. This marks PulteGroup\u2019s fourth consecutive year on the list and is a testament to the culture of personal caring and professional development that we work to maintain. I am proud to lead such an organization that is committed to taking care of our customers and each other. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.\nJames Zeumer: Great, thanks Ryan. We\u2019re now prepared to open the call for questions. So we can get to as many questions as possible during the remaining time of this call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Jeannie, if you would explain the process, we\u2019ll get ready to--we can start with our Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nStephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. Impressive results, and appreciate all the guidance that you provided. I guess my first question relates to your longer term targets with respect to land. Ryan, I think the last time I asked you this question, I was curious about where your long-term target is, and I think I stated it in terms of years owned. I understand that you want to have about seven years controlled with about 30% optioned over the long term - that would put you at about a little over two years of owned land. You\u2019re quite a bit above that now, and so my question is, am I thinking about that right? Is your long-term target for owned land - you know, a little over two years owned, and over what time span do you think we should expect you to migrate to that, if that is in fact your target?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Stephen, thanks for the question. I think your overall target of seven years controlled is about right, and then we stated our long-term target of optionality at 70%. We do think it will be a multi-year journey in getting there, and that\u2019s really driven by the fact, Stephen, that we want to do it in a very organic, natural way that drives ideal economics for each individual transaction. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, Bob did, that in the quarter, 74% of the deals that we approved were under option. We think that type of activity over the next several years will have us arrive at our long-term target in a very natural way. When we do that, to your point, we\u2019ll be right around something just over two, two and a half years of owned land at that point.\nStephen Kim: Yes, thanks for that. As you progress in that manner, it will unlock some additional cash flow in addition to your net earnings, and so I wanted to turn to cash flow next. I think you gave a guide for cash flow from operations for the full year previously at about $1.8 billion. You\u2019ve taken up--you had a great 1Q, you\u2019ve taken up your outlook for both volume and gross margin and, let\u2019s just say, operating margin for the year. Can you give us an update on where you\u2019re thinking cash flow from operations may come in for the full year in light of those changes, and maybe even more importantly, what should we expect in terms of deployment into dividends and repurchases. I noticed this quarter, for example, it was pretty much--buybacks were pretty much equal to cash flow from operations, and your leverage has pretty much stabilized in low single digits, so is it right to think that maybe whatever you generate in cash flow from operations, with a little bit of flex quarter to quarter, but in general that\u2019s about what you would deliver in terms of repayment--sorry, repurchases in dividends?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes Stephen, it\u2019s Bob. Good morning. We didn\u2019t update the guide on cash flow. It\u2019s early in the year. We\u2019re thinking about what we\u2019re investing in the business. You can see, if you look at the balance sheet just since the end of the year, we\u2019re up about $300 million in investment in the balance sheet, roughly half land, half house, and so to your point, we certainly expect with incremental volume and incremental margin that we\u2019ll generate a pretty healthy amount of cash. Some of that will be invested to meet that 5%, 10% growth that we\u2019ve talked about, so more to come on that as the year progresses, certainly, but I think the bias will be for more cash from operations. To your point on capital allocation, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent, right, for the last 10 years since we laid out our strategy for capital allocation: A, invest in the business, pay a dividend that grows with earnings, buy back stock with excess capital against a modest debt profile. Obviously the leverage is lower than we had anticipated. We look at liability management as part of our capital allocation, so I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d go so far as to say cash flow from operations will equal repurchase activity. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear we\u2019re going to report the news on what our repurchases are going to be, but we obviously--in a world where we\u2019re generating cash at that level, particularly if we have less invested in the balance sheet as we move towards that 70%, it will free up capital, and we\u2019ll work through what to do with that capital as we generate it.\nStephen Kim: Okay, well we\u2019ll be staying tuned. Thanks a lot, guys, and congratulations on the strong results.\nRyan Marshall: Thanks Stephen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Bouley: Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. In the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, you didn\u2019t raise incentives to chase volume. Now speaking to rates being higher for longer, eventually we\u2019ll be past the peak of the spring demand and all that, so I guess going forward, how are you thinking about that trade-off with incentives from here, given where your margins are? Is there an opportunity to perhaps trade a little bit of that margin to drive better growth, obviously in the context of supporting returns? Thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Matt, good morning, it\u2019s Ryan. Thanks for the question. We\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re not going to be margin proud, and I would tell you that remains true. As we highlighted in some of my prepared remarks today, we believe our operating platform and how we\u2019ve positioned our specific community investments, we\u2019re in a great position to command excellent pricing, get pace and price, which you saw in this most recent quarter. Given the interest rate environment that we are clearly going into, higher for longer, we\u2019ve got the ability to use the very powerful tool of forward mortgage rate commitments that allow us to offer a pretty attractive incentive program. Right now, we\u2019re at 5.75% nationally, and about 25% of our buyers are taking advantage of it. The other thing I\u2019d highlight is that 60% of our business is move-up and active adult, which tends to not be quite as rate-sensitive as the first-time buyer. With that first-time buyer, that\u2019s where predominantly our Centex brand, predominantly first-time buyers, and we see a higher percentage of those buyers take advantage of the forward rate commitments. The last piece, Matthew, that I\u2019d probably point out is that our guide for the balance of the year assumes that the incentive load that we currently have, which on the most recent quarter, closings was running at 6.5%, we\u2019ve assumed that that stays flat going forward.\nMatthew Bouley: Got you, okay. Thank you for that, Ryan. The second one, I wanted to move to the topic of land costs and land inflation. I think last quarter, you had spoken to the potential for mid to upper single-digit inflation in land, but maybe it wasn\u2019t totally clear on exactly when that would impact your gross margin. I\u2019m curious, can you kind of walk us through the timing of land costs flowing into your gross margin, and then what are you seeing in real time in the land market? Has the market started to decelerate at all, or is it still chugging along at that mid upper single-digit rate? Thank you.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Matt, it\u2019s Bob. That mid to high single-digit increase in our lot cost was in our Q1 and is expected to continue through the balance of the year. When we gave the margin guide, we had pretty good visibility into our lot costs, because those are lots typically on the ground already, so it\u2019s there. In terms of the current market conditions, it\u2019s still competitive out there. I\u2019ve said this before - land hasn\u2019t gone on sale, and slight variations in market typically don\u2019t result in prices declining. The market is super efficient on the way up, a little bit sticky on the way down, so for quality parcels it\u2019s competitive.\nMatthew Bouley: Got you, all right. That\u2019s clear. Thanks Bob. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nCarl Reichardt: Thanks, morning guys. I think this is the first time since mid-2020 when you have addressed construction cycle times, so I thought at least I\u2019d ask. Across the markets, products and geographic markets, are cycle times effectively normalized now for you, or are we still a little bit longer than you were pre-COVID?\nRyan Marshall: Good morning Carl, thanks for the question. We saw a couple of days of cycle time improvement in the most recent quarter, so we were at 128 days, down from 130 that we ended the fourth quarter of 2023 in. We are still on track and still are targeting being at 100 days by the end of the year. When we look deeper at our Q1 numbers, we had some long cycled closings that had been in production for a long time, in many cases were multi-family and condo buildings that we think kept the overall number that I just shared with you of 128 days a little bit higher than what we think is our actual run rate at this point. When we look at a lot of our markets, we\u2019re already back to pre-COVID cycle times of even sub-100 days, so we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in a lot of places. We have a few markets that are a little stickier, where we\u2019re working hard to get cycle times back to where we\u2019d like them to, but by and large we still feel that the target we\u2019ve set of 100 days is very much in reach.\nCarl Reichardt: Great, thank you Ryan. Then you talked a little bit about existing home inventory creep that I think we\u2019re seeing in some of the data. If we dig into that, Ryan, if you can dig into that, is this inventory that you\u2019d expect would be effectively a net neutral impact to the demand supply; in other words, [indiscernible] to move elsewhere versus vacant capacity, meaning investors or second homeowners who are putting their homes on the market effectively vacant, because I think there\u2019s an important difference between the two. To the extent that you know, what are you seeing? Thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, outside there might be--I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some markets, Carl, where there is vacant investor-driven inventory that you could characterize as new supply. The majority of the markets where we operate, we think any existing resale inventory that does come to market, those are buyers that are going to buy another home somewhere else, so we think it\u2019s largely neutral on the overall supply side.\nCarl Reichardt: Thank you Ryan. Thanks all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the potential impact of the NAR settlement on your business, or maybe the broader industry and any kind of potential secondary impacts to Pulte.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Anthony, we\u2019re watching it closely, as I think a lot of the real estate world is. Where we think it ultimately goes is it will create better transparency around the fee structure and will likely change over time the way that the providers of those services charge and the users, or the consumers, of those services ultimately pay. Realtors are an important part of our business and probably over 60% of the sales that we have include a buy-side realtor involved, so we certainly support the realtor community, they\u2019ve been an important part of our company for a long time, but we are watching the way that the landscape there will certainly change.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. Then you talked about stronger trends regionally, I think in Nevada, Arizona, California if I got that right. Is there anything particularly driving that in your view, and maybe if you can just talk about the long term attractiveness of that region as you build out the community count.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, a couple things happened there. It was a market that saw a lot of price appreciation in the COVID years. Affordability, we think got strained for certain. Last year, we did a fair amount of price discovery as we worked to right-size what our go-to-market price was in those markets. That combined with, I think, a general improvement in buyer sentiment contributed to the lights coming back on in the western markets. Some of the markets that we\u2019d highlighted pretty consistently last year - Seattle, northern California, southern California, Las Vegas, Phoenix, those were strong contributors to our overall results in this most recent quarter. We\u2019d expect that to continue. Bob highlighted that the relative margin contribution out of those markets will be lower than some of the other parts of our business. We\u2019ve incorporated that incremental volume that we\u2019re getting at a slightly lower margin contribution profile into our guide. Look - we\u2019re pleased that those markets are contributing. We\u2019ve got a lot of capital invested there, they\u2019re big housing markets. People want to live there for a number of reasons - climate, jobs, etc., so we\u2019re pleased that they\u2019re doing well.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Azzi: Hey guys, good morning. This is Andrew Azzi on for Mike. A quick one. I just wanted to drill down, if I could, on the demand trends you\u2019ve been seeing over the last few months, just given the change of rates and some concerns in the market. I\u2019d love any kind of progression you saw in the quarter and here into April.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, it was a strong quarter, a strong first quarter. We highlighted that we saw some trends that were even stronger than normal seasonality. The first few weeks of April have continued to show signs of strength. We did highlight that as we look at traffic, new traffic that\u2019s coming into the stores, while a limited number of days in that data set, we are seeing a small downturn that we think is reflective of the change in the rate environment. We\u2019re going to keep an eye on it. We don\u2019t at this point think it\u2019s anything to be too alarmed about, but we\u2019re watching it.\nAndrew Azzi: Great, thank you. Then I guess secondly on the material cost, how have these trended, and any kind of detail on how that\u2019s reflected in your 2Q gross margin, kind of your assumptions for stick and brick costs?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sure. Build costs, they were stable in the first quarter, about $80 a square foot for base house. That\u2019s flat with Q4 of \u201923 and it\u2019s actually down from $84 a square foot in the first quarter of last year. As we look at \u201924, we expect cost inflation on labor and materials to be pretty manageable with low single digit increases, and we\u2019ve factored that into our guide.\nAndrew Azzi: Thank you so much, I appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter.\nRyan Marshall: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lovallo: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The revised full-year gross margin outlook is about flat year-over-year, and I think previously you had talked about pricing being flat year-over-year - that was a little bit better in the first quarter, for sure, mid to high single digit land cost appreciation, kind of low single digit construction cost appreciation. Just curious how you guys are managing that to actually achieve a flat year-over-year gross margin in that kind of cost environment with what had previously been expected to be sort of flattish pricing.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, I think it\u2019s the strength of the market, John. We highlighted that we\u2019re raising prices in a number of our communities, that 1% to 5%. That\u2019s really the driver combined, certainly in this first quarter, with the mix differential that we had highlighted.\nJohn Lovallo: So is it pricing and mix a little bit better than previously expected?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, and just to be clear, John, the mix was really a Q1 issue. We think that smoothes out based on the relative strength of volume that Ryan highlighted out west, so we\u2019ll get more of that relatively lower margin profile in the back half of the year.\nJohn Lovallo: Okay, and that was sort of my follow-up. If we think about the positive mix impact of the first quarter, how much of the slight step-down from 29.6 to 29.2 in the gross margin outlook for the second quarter is the reversal of that mix impact, or is that really more of a back half phenomenon?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: It\u2019s both, right, but you\u2019ll see some of it in Q2 based on the sales that we did in the first quarter, and then you\u2019ll see more of it later in the year. That\u2019s part of the reason for the step-down in margin. The other thing that we highlighted on the call, we still have a lot of homes to sell for the back half of the year, and so the point we were making is it depends on how the demand environment holds up. If it does, that\u2019s good; if the market changed, you could see plus or minus depending on whether it\u2019s a positive change or a negative change.\nJohn Lovallo: Understood, thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Reid with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSam Reid: Awesome. Thanks so much, guys, for taking my questions, and thanks for the incremental color on April, especially the traffic detail. It definitely makes sense that the Centex buyer is a bit more rate-slash-payment sensitive, but I wanted to drill down on this a bit more and maybe see if you had any perspective on traffic across other parts of your business, that 60% that\u2019s kind of active adult and move-up, and what you\u2019re seeing from that buyer cohort, if anything, as rates move.\nRyan Marshall: Sam, we\u2019re not parsing the traffic data quite that finely for the purpose of this call. One other data point that I will tell you, while we\u2019ve seen traffic into the stores moderate over the last several days, traffic to the website has been incredibly strong, so we still think that there\u2019s high buyer demand and desire for home ownership. Certainly any time there is rate fluctuations, it can cause some disruption in buyer behavior, but we think the fundamental--or the overall demand for housing remains incredibly strong, and we\u2019re still in a very supply constrained environment. The overall thesis about this has been a strong operating environment for the industry and this company in what\u2019s been a pretty high interest rate environment, we think the environment that we would expect for the balance of the year, we can continue to show success in that type of situation as well. Affordability, there\u2019s no question it is the headwind that we\u2019ll continue to navigate for the balance of the year, and we think we\u2019ve got the tools to do that.\nJohn Lovallo: That\u2019s helpful. Then maybe switching gears here, it\u2019s been a little while since this topic has come up, but can you talk to your relationship with Invitation on the single family rental side, and give us an update on where things stand, perhaps how many homes you\u2019re looking to sell to them this year. Any color there would be great, thanks.\nRyan Marshall: Yes, we targeted--when we kind of kicked off the philosophy or the strategy that we had on single family rental with Invitation Homes, and we also partner with some other local single family rental operators as well, we\u2019ve targeted to be somewhere around 5% of our total volume would go into the single family rental channels. The current year, the closings that we have that will go into that pipeline are right in that 5% range. Certainly the interest rate environment currently, I think makes it harder for the single family rental operators to underwrite their deals. We wouldn\u2019t expect that to necessarily be the case forever, but in the right here and now a little harder to make those deals pencil for those SFR operators. It\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019ve said we want it to be part of our business, but not such an outsized component that it creates disruptions in how we operate.\nJohn Lovallo: That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it along, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRafe Jadrosich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about on the cost side, what are you seeing today in terms of the cash costs for land and materials relative to what\u2019s flowing through your P&L, and what\u2019s kind of the outlook on the cost side.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Certainly on the materials side, it is pretty consistent, and as Jim highlighted, our build cost per foot flat. The only thing where we\u2019re really feeling any pressure there is on OSP, which has run up a little bit. In terms of the land, we\u2019ve highlighted that high single digit increase in lot costs - that is, candidly, continuing a theme that has been going on for a number of years and is likely to persist. I\u2019ve often described it as a conveyer belt of land - you know, three years of lots that we buy in any or control at any one point in time, and they kind of roll on, the most recent year falls off. Every new year coming on is a little bit more expensive, and that\u2019s a combination of increased land costs and increased development costs, but we haven\u2019t seen a step change in that, if that\u2019s really what you\u2019re focused on. Again, I think you can and should expect to see our lot costs going up for the foreseeable future.\nRafe Jadrosich: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just looking at the first quarter gross margin, can you just talk about the drivers of the quarter, the 70 basis point quarter-over-quarter step-up, and then what were the upsides to your initial guidance?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Sorry, was that--are you asking sequentially or year-over-year?\nRafe Jadrosich: Sequentially.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, so you\u2019ve got 70 basis points - certainly a part of that is going to be the strength of the--relative to our guide of the strength of the market, where for the spec homes that we sold, we got better pricing, which was a relative margin benefit over the fourth quarter. The other thing is the mix shift, not just in terms of geography, which we had highlighted, but on a sequential basis we also had a mix shift towards move-up, which has a higher margin profile relative to first-time, which is where the margin came from. I hate to use this, but there is mix and there\u2019s a couple of different mixes going on, but when you\u2019re looking at the sequential margin performance, certainly it\u2019s the strength of the market relative to what we thought coming into it, and also it\u2019s a little bit more move-up, which has a higher margin profile for us.\nRafe Jadrosich: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMike Dahl: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m going to stick with margins. Bob, you kind of alluded to this - it\u2019s a tricky time when you\u2019ve just had this rate move, you\u2019re maybe just on the front end of seeing some traffic impacts but you\u2019re having to give guide out a few quarters, and so I appreciate that there\u2019s still some uncertainty when you\u2019ve got a third of your full year closings yet to be sold. Maybe just talk through the assumption for flat incentives against this move in rates. Just talk about why that is the baseline assumption, or if it just felt like the right placeholders and matches what your backlog margins look like today. Maybe just a little more detail on how you went through this process at kind of an odd time, when the rate move just happened.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Yes, it\u2019s interesting. I\u2019d refer back to something Ryan offered, which is the affordability is still a challenge. Against that backdrop, our expectation is that we will need to continue to incentivize folks, and the predominant way we\u2019re doing that today is through our national commitments and some sort of rate finance support. Our expectation is that that continues. That was our expectation coming into the year. In the first quarter, you heard us say it was 6.5% again, just like the fourth quarter - that\u2019s roughly $35,000, $40,000 a house. In a world where rates are actually trending back up, I think that we\u2019re going to need to continue to support that. It\u2019s a little bit challenging, to your point, but I think on balance, our expectation is that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to need to be to meet some of the affordability needs. It\u2019s one of the reasons we think you\u2019ll continue to see this strong market performance on a relative basis of new versus resale, because we can offer those incentives.\nMike Dahl: I guess as my follow-up, more specifically, that kind of implies that you\u2019ll get your advertised rate flow up over time to match what the market move is and maintain your relative incentive, and so if you\u2019re allowing your rate to kind of float up, call it 40, 50 basis points from where it may have been a month or two ago, what have you done or seen in terms of thinking about sensitizing some of the recent demand trends, particularly in your Centex brand? I understand that it\u2019s not going to be a major--potentially not as major a dynamic for your move-up or active adult, but in your Centex brand, what\u2019s the sensitivity to a 40, 50 basis point move in rates that you\u2019ve seen or thought about?\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Well, certainly for that true entry-level buyer, it\u2019s the game, right, and so we\u2019ve got programs that offer them lower cost incentives, so we\u2019re giving them more rate support relative to others who have choices. It\u2019s worth it to remember we offer a national program, but there\u2019s a lot of detail in terms of what we can and actually do offer to people and what they want to access in terms of our support. There will be some people with rates moving up that will literally fall off the ability to buy a home - that\u2019s not the case for our active adult and move-up buyers. Candidly, for a lot of our Centex buyers, you look at our average sales price at $419,000 in this most recent quarter, that\u2019s not typically your true entry level buyer - we\u2019re at a little bit higher price point. Our first time communities are typically a little bit closer in, and so I think it depends on who your buyer is, but to answer your question about will we vary our offering, the answer is yes. We have been. We are actively managing these national programs. We\u2019re buying commitments in relatively small amounts so that we don\u2019t get caught by market changes, and what it allows us to do is change our offering based on what the market is doing. As the market--as rates floated down, we moved our offer rate down somewhat to try and be responsive to deliver a real savings versus the street rate that they can get on their mortgage. As rates tick back up, we\u2019re moving those rates up a little bit. It\u2019s an art, not a science, but I think what you could expect us to do is listen to the consumers in terms of what they need and seek to offer them programs that give them what they need.\nMike Dahl: Thanks Bob, appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nAlan Ratner: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Nice quarter. Would love to get your updated thoughts on specs versus build to order. I know you and others ramped the spec production as cycle times re-elongated and there was a premium, or at least that margin differential spec versus BTO was kind of smaller than it historically has been. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re thinking about that any differently today with cycle times continuing to normalize and rates seemingly being higher for longer. It sounds like maybe the Centex offering, which is predominantly spec, I would think, is maybe seeing more of that impact than the move-up rate, so are you at the point now where you are kind of dialing back the spec starts a bit, or do you still want to maintain the current mix of your business?\nRyan Marshall: We\u2019re pretty happy with where we\u2019re operating, and we look at a couple--I mean, the first thing we look at is what\u2019s the percentage of build-to-order versus spec sales. Right now, that\u2019s running around 50/50, and then we highlighted in Bob\u2019s prepared remarks, 40% of our width is spec, and we\u2019ve got a little bit higher than one final per active community. We pay attention to it closely. It\u2019s something we spend a lot of time managing and being responsive to what we\u2019re seeing in the market. To your point, most of our spec--our Centex business is spec. We certainly have a little bit of spec in the other two brands, but Pulte and Del Webb tend to be more of a build-to-order model, and we\u2019re certainly responsive to those as well. We\u2019re going to watch it, but in a higher interest rate environment, having available specs that you can more efficiently and effectively apply the most powerful incentive to in the form of the forward mortgage rate commitments, you can do that better on spec inventory, which makes it more attractive. You\u2019ll probably see us stay pretty close to where we\u2019re at.\nAlan Ratner: Great, appreciate your thoughts there, Ryan. Then pivoting to the incentive environment, I think obviously you guys certainly made the right call by not chasing the market lower in the fourth quarter, based on your performance this quarter. It sounds like from your guide for flattish incentives, you\u2019re not expecting to have to ramp discounts as the selling season moves into its later stages, but what is the sensitivity you\u2019re looking at there? How much longer will the more recent, I guess softer traffic trends, or maybe sales activity, how long would that have to persist before you would sit there and say, you know what, we need to maybe increase those incentives a little bit to bring up the sales pace? Is it a few months, is it getting past the peak of the selling season and you\u2019re sitting on more inventory than you\u2019d like? What\u2019s the decision process there look like?\nRyan Marshall: Yes Alan, we look at sales rates every single day - it\u2019s one of the first emails that I look at, what did sales for the prior day come in at, and we look at qualitative and quantitative feedback that we get from our field operations in going through that decision making process. What I can tell you is the rate--the change in rage, nevermind what it was and nevermind what it\u2019s going to, just the mere fact something changed, we\u2019ve seen that cause pauses in buyer behavior over the last two or--you know, last 24 months. Anytime there\u2019s been a step change in rate and the media cycle that goes with it, that certainly has a pretty profound impact on buyer behavior. Time does seem to cure it. The only thing that I would continue to caveat and put out there is that affordability continues to be a real issue, and so we\u2019ve got to balance the change there. We think--you know, one of the things that we\u2019re going to continue to do is pay attention to what the headline rate is, and Bob talked about that a few questions ago. Our national mortgage rate incentives have got the flexibility to move based on what the market\u2019s doing, so we still think we can have a compelling offer out there relative to the street rate that doesn\u2019t necessarily cost us a whole bunch more, relative to what we\u2019re currently paying. The last piece, Alan, is we are going to keep our production machine moving. We are a production builder and we\u2019re going to do that in a way that we think optimizes kind of returns, so if there are price changes or discount changes that ultimately have an impact on affordability, that allow us to continue to turn the asset and keep the market share that we have, we\u2019ll definitely do that.\nAlan Ratner: Thanks a lot for the thoughts, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the call, and we\u2019ll take our final question from Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nKen Zener: Good morning everybody.\nRobert O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey Ken.\nKen Zener: Wonder if you could just give some context on the regional comments you made, and I want to narrow it down to Florida because it\u2019s a segment that obviously generates quite a bit of your EBIT. Can you, within Florida, talk about how that existing market supply rising affected, let\u2019s say, the Centex versus your move-up brand, realizing Orlando is different than coastal markets? It\u2019s such a big market for you guys profitability-wise. If you could maybe give a little color related to the margin swings you\u2019re kind of seeing with those trade-up buyers\u2019 entry within markets that are seeing the pick-up in inventory specific to Florida, thank you.\nRyan Marshall: Yes Ken, I want to make sure that I understood kind of the full question. Maybe I\u2019ll give you a little bit of Florida commentary and then if there\u2019s more follow-up, I\u2019ll let you ask that. Florida is a tremendous part of our business. We\u2019re in nearly every major housing market there save Miami. A big part of our business there tends to be focused on move-up and age targeted. We have some entry-level business in our Tampa and Orlando businesses, but the other big markets are predominantly move-up and age targeted. We get a little bit of move-up in Jacksonville as well--or a little bit of entry-level on Jacksonville as well, so. Really strong business, a lot of job relocation there, a lot of folks that want to be there because they\u2019ve got flexible work arrangements that allow them to work from home or work from elsewhere. The headwinds in Florida are definitely affordability - we\u2019ve seen strong price appreciation in most Florida markets, and then the other headwind that you\u2019ve got there is around property taxes and insurance. Certainly those things kind of play into that, but Florida continues to be a big part of our business and a real bright spot for our business as well.\nKen Zener: That was sufficient, thank you very much.\nOperator: I will now turn the conference back over to Jim Zeumer for closing remarks.\nJames Zeumer: Great, appreciate everybody\u2019s time today. We\u2019re around the remainder of the day for ay follow-up questions, and we will look forward to speaking with you at various upcoming conferences and/or on our next quarter\u2019s earnings call. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert O'Shaughnessy",
            "content": "Thanks Ryan, and good morning. As Ryan noted, the company delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter, which have us well positioned to realize outstanding financial performance throughout 2024. In the first quarter, we reported home sale revenues of $3.8 billion, which represents an increase of 10% over the prior year's first quarter. Higher revenues in the period were driven by an 11% increase in closings to 7,095 homes, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average sales price of $538,000. The lower closing price compared to the first quarter of last year reflects a shift in the geographic mix of homes closed as we realized relatively higher closings from our southeast and Florida markets with more modest increases in our higher priced western markets. Closings in the quarter came in above our guide as we had available spec inventory to meet the strong buyer demand we experienced this period. As Ryan highlighted, by choosing not to chase volume in last year's fourth quarter, we had additional inventory in Q1 that we were able to sell and close with better margins due to the improving buyer demand activity in the quarter. Our spec production is predominantly within our first-time buyer communities, so on a year-over-year basis we realized increased closings from first-time buyers. In the quarter, our closing mix included 41% first-time, 36% move-up, and 23% active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the mix of closings consisted of 38% first-time, 36% move-up, and 26% active adult. Reflecting the favorable demand conditions we experienced in the first quarter, net new orders increased 14% over last year to 8,379 homes. In the quarter, we realized a year-over-year increase in gross orders and a reduction in cancellation rates. Cancellations as a percentage of starting backlog fell to 10.1%, down from 12.7% in the first quarter last year. Average community count for our first quarter was 931, which is an increase of 6% over the prior year and in line with our guidance for year-over-year community count growth of 3% to 5%. The resulting absorption pace of approximately three homes per month for the quarter was above our historic average for the period, excluding the pandemic-impacted years of '21 and '22. I would also like to highlight that orders in the quarter were higher across all buyer groups, which is another sign of the overall strength of the market. More specifically, net new orders among first-time buyers increased 8%, move-up increased 22%, and active adult increased 12%. Consistent with earlier comments, the large increase in orders among move-up buyers was influenced by improving market conditions in the west, where our business mix is much more heavily weighted towards move-up. Given this strong start to our spring selling season, our quarter-end backlog increased to 13,430 homes with a value of $8.2 billion. We started approximately 7,500 homes in the quarter and ended the period with a total of 17,250 homes under construction. Our production pipeline includes approximately 7,000 or 41% spec homes, of which 1,337 are completed. We are operating just above our target of one finished spec per community but believe carrying a few more finished specs was the right strategy, given buyers' preferences and the fact that we are still in the more active spring selling season. Given the units we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to close between 7,800 and 8,200 homes in the second quarter. With the strong start to the year in both orders and closings, we are raising our guide for full-year closings to approximately 31,000 homes. This would represent an 8% increase over 2023, which is the higher end of our long-term goal of growing our closing volume between 5% and 10% annually. Closings in the first quarter had an average sales price of $538,000, which was slightly below our guide for pricing of $540,000 to $550,000. Relative to our guide, pricing in the quarter was influenced by the geographic mix of closings along with a higher volume of spec homes closed in the period. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect the mix of homes closed in each quarter will result in ASPs consistent with our prior guide of $540,000 to $550,000. For the first quarter, we reported a gross margin of 29.6%, which is an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of '23 and a sequential gain of 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of '23. At 29.6%, our first quarter gross margin was also notably higher than our guide. Beyond Ryan's comments that we are achieving higher returns by actively managing both pace and price, mix had an impacted on our reported Q1 margins. Higher demand increased as the quarter advanced, which allowed us to sell and close more homes in the period than forecast. On a relative basis, more of these closings occurred in our higher margin markets in the southeast and Florida, resulting in a meaningful increase in reported gross margins for the quarter. Based on Q1 sign-ups and the composition of our backlog, we expect the geographic mix of closings to be more balanced as we move through the remainder of the year. That being said, we're raising our gross margin guide for the remainder of '24. We had previously guided to quarterly gross margins of 28% to 28.5%, but we now expect gross margins in the second quarter to be approximately 29.2%. Based on current backlog, we would expect gross margins for our third and fourth quarters to be approximately 29%, but we still have homes to sell and close, so demand conditions over the coming months will impact the results we ultimately report. Beyond buyer demand and near-term pricing dynamics, the gross margin guide for the remainder of '24 also reflects expected changes in the geographic mix of homes we expect to close. Given recent sign-up trends, we anticipate closing more homes in our west region, which currently have a lower relative margin profile due to the fact that we adjusted pricing in these markets over the course of '23 to achieve appropriate sales pace. Looking at our costs, reported SG&A in the first quarter was $358 million or 9.4% of home sale revenues. As noted in our press release, our reported SG&A for the period includes a $27 million pre-tax insurance benefit. SG&A in the first quarter of '23 was $337 million of 9.6% of home sale revenues. Consistent with our previous guide, we continue to expect SG&A expense for the full year to be in the range of 9.2% to 9.5% of home sale revenues. Based on normal seasonality, we expect to realize increased overhead leverage as we move through the remaining quarters of the year. Our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $41 million for the first quarter, which is an increase of almost 200% from last year's pre-tax income of $14 million. The increase in Q1 pre-tax income was driven by better market conditions across our financial services platform. Financial services also benefited from higher capture rates across all business lines, including an increase to 84%, up from 78% last year in our mortgage operations. As noted in this morning's press release, in the first quarter we completed the sale of a joint venture that resulted in a gain of $38 million. On our income statement, this gain was recorded in equity income from unconsolidated entities. Our reported first quarter pre-tax income was period record of $869 million, an increase of 24% over last year. Against that, we reported tax expense of $206 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%. Our reported Q1 tax rate was impacted by energy tax credits and stock compensation deductions recorded in the period. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In total, our reported Q1 net income was $663 million or $3.10 per share, compared with prior year reported net income of $533 million or $2.35 per share. Earnings per share in our most recent quarter benefited from a 6% reduction in share count compared with the prior year as we continue to systematically repurchase our stock. Moving past the income statement, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in land acquisition and development in the first quarter. Consistent with our recent land activity, 60% of our land spend in the quarter was for the development of our existing land assets. Our Q1 land spend keeps us on track with our plans to invest approximately $5 billion in land acquisition and development for the full year, of which we continue to expect about 60% will be for development with the remainder for the acquisition of new land positions. We ended the quarter with approximately 220,000 lots under control, of which 51% were held via option. The purchase of several large land positions in combination with the decision not to move forward with a few option transactions during the quarter lowered our lot option percentage from the end of 2023. I would highlight, however, that 74% of the lots we had pre-approved in this most recent quarter were under option. As our first quarter numbers indicate, we continue to work toward our multi-year goal of controlling 70% of our land by buying via option. Looking at our community count, we continue to expect average community count for 2024 to increase 3% to 5% in each quarter over the comparable prior year period. Along with investing in our business, we continue to return capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million common shares at a cost of $246 million for an average price of $106.73 per share. In the quarter, we also opportunistically purchased approximately $10 million of our outstanding bonds. After allocating approximately $1.4 billion to investments and the return of funds to shareholders, we ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of cash. Taking all of this into account, our quarter-end gross debt to capital ratio was 15.4%, while our net debt to capital ratio was only 1.7%. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments. Yes Stephen, it's Bob. Good morning. We didn't update the guide on cash flow. It's early in the year. We're thinking about what we're investing in the business. You can see, if you look at the balance sheet just since the end of the year, we're up about $300 million in investment in the balance sheet, roughly half land, half house, and so to your point, we certainly expect with incremental volume and incremental margin that we'll generate a pretty healthy amount of cash. Some of that will be invested to meet that 5%, 10% growth that we've talked about, so more to come on that as the year progresses, certainly, but I think the bias will be for more cash from operations. To your point on capital allocation, I think we've been pretty consistent, right, for the last 10 years since we laid out our strategy for capital allocation: A, invest in the business, pay a dividend that grows with earnings, buy back stock with excess capital against a modest debt profile. Obviously the leverage is lower than we had anticipated. We look at liability management as part of our capital allocation, so I don't know that I'd go so far as to say cash flow from operations will equal repurchase activity. I think we've been pretty clear we're going to report the news on what our repurchases are going to be, but we obviously--in a world where we're generating cash at that level, particularly if we have less invested in the balance sheet as we move towards that 70%, it will free up capital, and we'll work through what to do with that capital as we generate it. Matt, it's Bob. That mid to high single-digit increase in our lot cost was in our Q1 and is expected to continue through the balance of the year. When we gave the margin guide, we had pretty good visibility into our lot costs, because those are lots typically on the ground already, so it's there. In terms of the current market conditions, it's still competitive out there. I've said this before - land hasn't gone on sale, and slight variations in market typically don't result in prices declining. The market is super efficient on the way up, a little bit sticky on the way down, so for quality parcels it's competitive. Sure. Build costs, they were stable in the first quarter, about $80 a square foot for base house. That's flat with Q4 of '23 and it's actually down from $84 a square foot in the first quarter of last year. As we look at '24, we expect cost inflation on labor and materials to be pretty manageable with low single digit increases, and we've factored that into our guide. Yes, I think it's the strength of the market, John. We highlighted that we're raising prices in a number of our communities, that 1% to 5%. That's really the driver combined, certainly in this first quarter, with the mix differential that we had highlighted. Yes, and just to be clear, John, the mix was really a Q1 issue. We think that smoothes out based on the relative strength of volume that Ryan highlighted out west, so we'll get more of that relatively lower margin profile in the back half of the year. It's both, right, but you'll see some of it in Q2 based on the sales that we did in the first quarter, and then you'll see more of it later in the year. That's part of the reason for the step-down in margin. The other thing that we highlighted on the call, we still have a lot of homes to sell for the back half of the year, and so the point we were making is it depends on how the demand environment holds up. If it does, that's good; if the market changed, you could see plus or minus depending on whether it's a positive change or a negative change. Certainly on the materials side, it is pretty consistent, and as Jim highlighted, our build cost per foot flat. The only thing where we're really feeling any pressure there is on OSP, which has run up a little bit. In terms of the land, we've highlighted that high single digit increase in lot costs - that is, candidly, continuing a theme that has been going on for a number of years and is likely to persist. I've often described it as a conveyer belt of land - you know, three years of lots that we buy in any or control at any one point in time, and they kind of roll on, the most recent year falls off. Every new year coming on is a little bit more expensive, and that's a combination of increased land costs and increased development costs, but we haven't seen a step change in that, if that's really what you're focused on. Again, I think you can and should expect to see our lot costs going up for the foreseeable future. Sorry, was that--are you asking sequentially or year-over-year? Yes, so you've got 70 basis points - certainly a part of that is going to be the strength of the--relative to our guide of the strength of the market, where for the spec homes that we sold, we got better pricing, which was a relative margin benefit over the fourth quarter. The other thing is the mix shift, not just in terms of geography, which we had highlighted, but on a sequential basis we also had a mix shift towards move-up, which has a higher margin profile relative to first-time, which is where the margin came from. I hate to use this, but there is mix and there's a couple of different mixes going on, but when you're looking at the sequential margin performance, certainly it's the strength of the market relative to what we thought coming into it, and also it's a little bit more move-up, which has a higher margin profile for us. Yes, it's interesting. I'd refer back to something Ryan offered, which is the affordability is still a challenge. Against that backdrop, our expectation is that we will need to continue to incentivize folks, and the predominant way we're doing that today is through our national commitments and some sort of rate finance support. Our expectation is that that continues. That was our expectation coming into the year. In the first quarter, you heard us say it was 6.5% again, just like the fourth quarter - that's roughly $35,000, $40,000 a house. In a world where rates are actually trending back up, I think that we're going to need to continue to support that. It's a little bit challenging, to your point, but I think on balance, our expectation is that's where we're going to need to be to meet some of the affordability needs. It's one of the reasons we think you'll continue to see this strong market performance on a relative basis of new versus resale, because we can offer those incentives. Well, certainly for that true entry-level buyer, it's the game, right, and so we've got programs that offer them lower cost incentives, so we're giving them more rate support relative to others who have choices. It's worth it to remember we offer a national program, but there's a lot of detail in terms of what we can and actually do offer to people and what they want to access in terms of our support. There will be some people with rates moving up that will literally fall off the ability to buy a home - that's not the case for our active adult and move-up buyers. Candidly, for a lot of our Centex buyers, you look at our average sales price at $419,000 in this most recent quarter, that's not typically your true entry level buyer - we're at a little bit higher price point. Our first time communities are typically a little bit closer in, and so I think it depends on who your buyer is, but to answer your question about will we vary our offering, the answer is yes. We have been. We are actively managing these national programs. We're buying commitments in relatively small amounts so that we don't get caught by market changes, and what it allows us to do is change our offering based on what the market is doing. As the market--as rates floated down, we moved our offer rate down somewhat to try and be responsive to deliver a real savings versus the street rate that they can get on their mortgage. As rates tick back up, we're moving those rates up a little bit. It's an art, not a science, but I think what you could expect us to do is listen to the consumers in terms of what they need and seek to offer them programs that give them what they need. Hey Ken."

            "name": "Ryan Marshall",
            "content": "Thanks Jim, and good morning. As you read in this morning's press release, PulteGroup reported record first quarter results across many of our key financial metrics. From top line revenues of $3.8 billion and gross margins of 29.6% to bottom line earnings of $3.10 per share, it was an exceptional quarter. These strong first quarter results helped to drive a return on equity of 27.3% for the trailing 12-month period. Our strong first quarter results reflect long-term strategic planning and a disciplined capital allocation process that have underpinned PulteGroup's success for more than a decade. I would suggest that another driver of our record Q1 results are decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year, decisions that I think are emblematic of the balanced approach we take to running our business and to delivering high returns. On our last earnings call, we talked about decisions we made in the fourth quarter of last year to not lower our prices in a chase for volume. As you will recall, demand in the fourth quarter of 2023 had started slowly but improved as interest rates began to moderate. As we made the decision to push incentives aggressively as the quarter progressed, we likely could have delivered higher closing volumes in '23. With demand improving in the fourth quarter, we elected to hold our pricing and have had more inventory available for the 2024 spring selling season. The result of this decision is that we were in a position to sell and close more homes in the first quarter of 2024, and at higher margins. That's what you see in our Q1 results - closings and gross margins above our guide as demand dynamics allowed us to sell more homes with better net pricing. When buyer demand is rising, we're often asked how many more homes we can sell given the value we place on entitled loss and our focus on driving high returns. More volume is not the only answer as we work to balance pace and price to drive high returns. Within our operating model, stronger demand provides choices: we can sell more houses or we can raise prices, or as was the case in the first quarter, we can do both. What we experienced in the first quarter is that areas of strong demand last year, such as the southeast, Florida and Texas, continued to perform well into 2024. Even more positive is that areas that had some struggles in 2023, notably Arizona, California and Nevada, were much improved in 2024. Consistent with the favorable conditions in the first quarter, almost all our markets displayed pricing dynamics that were stable or improving, which allowed us to raise net pricing in more than half of our communities. As you've heard us say many times, our pricing decisions are made with a goal of delivering high returns and the best overall business outcomes. Depending upon the community and the buyer's wants and needs, we may have raised base prices or lowered incentives, the result being that net pricing in the quarter across many of our markets was up between 1% and 5%. The impact of these actions on our business performance is powerful. As Bob will discuss, we are increasing guidance for both full-year closings and gross margins. Against generally favorable demand conditions, the supply of available housing remains tight. We have a long-term structural issue resulting from a decade of under-building that has the country short approximately 4 million housing units. At the same time, the available inventory of existing homes for sale continues to be low as homeowners remain locked into their low mortgage rates. Life happens, so we are seeing some additional existing homes come to market, but the numbers remain well below historic rates. As a homebuilder, this is a great operating environment as we are supplying a product that a lot of people need and want. I appreciate, however, that our country's housing shortage can create hardships for today's consumers as the lack of supply keeps housing prices high. In fact, some of our recent buyers said that they made the decision to buy now because they couldn't wait any longer for rates to roll back. In a market where home prices are high and because of limited inventory, they will likely continue moving higher. Our company's ability to offer targeted incentives, particularly mortgage rate buy-downs, is a powerful tool that can help bridge the affordability gap. For example, in the first quarter, approximately 25% of our home buyers used our national rate program. In a world where the consensus is that interest rates will be higher for longer, our interest rate incentives likely become an even greater competitive advantage, especially relative to the existing home seller. Higher interest rates create additional challenges for today's home buyers, but we appreciate that rates are moving higher because of a resilient economy and a strong job market. Given these conditions, we are optimistic about 2024 and PulteGroup's ability to continue delivering strong financial results. Now let me turn the call over to Bob for a review of our first quarter results. Bob? Thanks Bob. As you would expect, given the strength of our first quarter results, buyer interest was high in the period as order paces increased beyond typical seasonality. That sales momentum continued into April, although we are now seeing some moderation of traffic into our communities due to the recent increases in interest rates, particularly within the Centex brand. While the change is relatively modest and based on a limited number of days, consumer feedback suggests that higher rates are causing some buyers to evaluate the timing of their activity due to the volatile interest rate environment. We'll continue to monitor how buyers respond to changes in the rate environment and are prepared to adjust pricing or incentives to ensure we are appropriately turning assets. During our last earnings call, we talked about the opportunity for PulteGroup to grow its business 5% to 10% annually. Given the lengthy land investment process, organic change in this industry takes time to accomplish, but we have been systematically planning and positioning to deliver against this goal for the past few years. I think that the company's efforts are reflected in the allocation of capital into growing our business. Including our Q1 spend, since 2021 our operating teams have invested approximately $14 billion in land acquisition and development, with plans to invest another $5 billion in 2024. Along with the land, we have been investing in our people and working to ensure the needed trade capacity is available to support our expanding operations. I'm proud to say that we have accomplished this while adhering to the same underwriting hurdles and investment disciplines which have been the cornerstone of PulteGroup for the past decade. Such discipline has allowed PulteGroup to more consistently grow its earnings, drive substantial cash flow from operations and deliver high returns, we have accomplished this while maintaining the superior build quality and customer experience which PulteGroup home buyers have come to expect. Before opening the call to questions, I want to take a minute to recognize and celebrate our team for once again being named a Fortune 100 Best Company to Work For. What makes this recognition so important and gratifying is that it's based on feedback from all of our employees. This marks PulteGroup's fourth consecutive year on the list and is a testament to the culture of personal caring and professional development that we work to maintain. I am proud to lead such an organization that is committed to taking care of our customers and each other. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer. Yes Stephen, thanks for the question. I think your overall target of seven years controlled is about right, and then we stated our long-term target of optionality at 70%. We do think it will be a multi-year journey in getting there, and that's really driven by the fact, Stephen, that we want to do it in a very organic, natural way that drives ideal economics for each individual transaction. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, Bob did, that in the quarter, 74% of the deals that we approved were under option. We think that type of activity over the next several years will have us arrive at our long-term target in a very natural way. When we do that, to your point, we'll be right around something just over two, two and a half years of owned land at that point. Thanks Stephen. Matt, good morning, it's Ryan. Thanks for the question. We've said in the past, we're not going to be margin proud, and I would tell you that remains true. As we highlighted in some of my prepared remarks today, we believe our operating platform and how we've positioned our specific community investments, we're in a great position to command excellent pricing, get pace and price, which you saw in this most recent quarter. Given the interest rate environment that we are clearly going into, higher for longer, we've got the ability to use the very powerful tool of forward mortgage rate commitments that allow us to offer a pretty attractive incentive program. Right now, we're at 5.75% nationally, and about 25% of our buyers are taking advantage of it. The other thing I'd highlight is that 60% of our business is move-up and active adult, which tends to not be quite as rate-sensitive as the first-time buyer. With that first-time buyer, that's where predominantly our Centex brand, predominantly first-time buyers, and we see a higher percentage of those buyers take advantage of the forward rate commitments. The last piece, Matthew, that I'd probably point out is that our guide for the balance of the year assumes that the incentive load that we currently have, which on the most recent quarter, closings was running at 6.5%, we've assumed that that stays flat going forward. Good morning Carl, thanks for the question. We saw a couple of days of cycle time improvement in the most recent quarter, so we were at 128 days, down from 130 that we ended the fourth quarter of 2023 in. We are still on track and still are targeting being at 100 days by the end of the year. When we look deeper at our Q1 numbers, we had some long cycled closings that had been in production for a long time, in many cases were multi-family and condo buildings that we think kept the overall number that I just shared with you of 128 days a little bit higher than what we think is our actual run rate at this point. When we look at a lot of our markets, we're already back to pre-COVID cycle times of even sub-100 days, so we've made a lot of progress in a lot of places. We have a few markets that are a little stickier, where we're working hard to get cycle times back to where we'd like them to, but by and large we still feel that the target we've set of 100 days is very much in reach. Yes, outside there might be--I'm sure there's some markets, Carl, where there is vacant investor-driven inventory that you could characterize as new supply. The majority of the markets where we operate, we think any existing resale inventory that does come to market, those are buyers that are going to buy another home somewhere else, so we think it's largely neutral on the overall supply side. Yes Anthony, we're watching it closely, as I think a lot of the real estate world is. Where we think it ultimately goes is it will create better transparency around the fee structure and will likely change over time the way that the providers of those services charge and the users, or the consumers, of those services ultimately pay. Realtors are an important part of our business and probably over 60% of the sales that we have include a buy-side realtor involved, so we certainly support the realtor community, they've been an important part of our company for a long time, but we are watching the way that the landscape there will certainly change. Yes, a couple things happened there. It was a market that saw a lot of price appreciation in the COVID years. Affordability, we think got strained for certain. Last year, we did a fair amount of price discovery as we worked to right-size what our go-to-market price was in those markets. That combined with, I think, a general improvement in buyer sentiment contributed to the lights coming back on in the western markets. Some of the markets that we'd highlighted pretty consistently last year - Seattle, northern California, southern California, Las Vegas, Phoenix, those were strong contributors to our overall results in this most recent quarter. We'd expect that to continue. Bob highlighted that the relative margin contribution out of those markets will be lower than some of the other parts of our business. We've incorporated that incremental volume that we're getting at a slightly lower margin contribution profile into our guide. Look - we're pleased that those markets are contributing. We've got a lot of capital invested there, they're big housing markets. People want to live there for a number of reasons - climate, jobs, etc., so we're pleased that they're doing well. Yes, it was a strong quarter, a strong first quarter. We highlighted that we saw some trends that were even stronger than normal seasonality. The first few weeks of April have continued to show signs of strength. We did highlight that as we look at traffic, new traffic that's coming into the stores, while a limited number of days in that data set, we are seeing a small downturn that we think is reflective of the change in the rate environment. We're going to keep an eye on it. We don't at this point think it's anything to be too alarmed about, but we're watching it. Thank you. Sam, we're not parsing the traffic data quite that finely for the purpose of this call. One other data point that I will tell you, while we've seen traffic into the stores moderate over the last several days, traffic to the website has been incredibly strong, so we still think that there's high buyer demand and desire for home ownership. Certainly any time there is rate fluctuations, it can cause some disruption in buyer behavior, but we think the fundamental--or the overall demand for housing remains incredibly strong, and we're still in a very supply constrained environment. The overall thesis about this has been a strong operating environment for the industry and this company in what's been a pretty high interest rate environment, we think the environment that we would expect for the balance of the year, we can continue to show success in that type of situation as well. Affordability, there's no question it is the headwind that we'll continue to navigate for the balance of the year, and we think we've got the tools to do that. Yes, we targeted--when we kind of kicked off the philosophy or the strategy that we had on single family rental with Invitation Homes, and we also partner with some other local single family rental operators as well, we've targeted to be somewhere around 5% of our total volume would go into the single family rental channels. The current year, the closings that we have that will go into that pipeline are right in that 5% range. Certainly the interest rate environment currently, I think makes it harder for the single family rental operators to underwrite their deals. We wouldn't expect that to necessarily be the case forever, but in the right here and now a little harder to make those deals pencil for those SFR operators. It's part of the reason that we've said we want it to be part of our business, but not such an outsized component that it creates disruptions in how we operate. We're pretty happy with where we're operating, and we look at a couple--I mean, the first thing we look at is what's the percentage of build-to-order versus spec sales. Right now, that's running around 50/50, and then we highlighted in Bob's prepared remarks, 40% of our width is spec, and we've got a little bit higher than one final per active community. We pay attention to it closely. It's something we spend a lot of time managing and being responsive to what we're seeing in the market. To your point, most of our spec--our Centex business is spec. We certainly have a little bit of spec in the other two brands, but Pulte and Del Webb tend to be more of a build-to-order model, and we're certainly responsive to those as well. We're going to watch it, but in a higher interest rate environment, having available specs that you can more efficiently and effectively apply the most powerful incentive to in the form of the forward mortgage rate commitments, you can do that better on spec inventory, which makes it more attractive. You'll probably see us stay pretty close to where we're at. Yes Alan, we look at sales rates every single day - it's one of the first emails that I look at, what did sales for the prior day come in at, and we look at qualitative and quantitative feedback that we get from our field operations in going through that decision making process. What I can tell you is the rate--the change in rage, nevermind what it was and nevermind what it's going to, just the mere fact something changed, we've seen that cause pauses in buyer behavior over the last two or--you know, last 24 months. Anytime there's been a step change in rate and the media cycle that goes with it, that certainly has a pretty profound impact on buyer behavior. Time does seem to cure it. The only thing that I would continue to caveat and put out there is that affordability continues to be a real issue, and so we've got to balance the change there. We think--you know, one of the things that we're going to continue to do is pay attention to what the headline rate is, and Bob talked about that a few questions ago. Our national mortgage rate incentives have got the flexibility to move based on what the market's doing, so we still think we can have a compelling offer out there relative to the street rate that doesn't necessarily cost us a whole bunch more, relative to what we're currently paying. The last piece, Alan, is we are going to keep our production machine moving. We are a production builder and we're going to do that in a way that we think optimizes kind of returns, so if there are price changes or discount changes that ultimately have an impact on affordability, that allow us to continue to turn the asset and keep the market share that we have, we'll definitely do that. Yes Ken, I want to make sure that I understood kind of the full question. Maybe I'll give you a little bit of Florida commentary and then if there's more follow-up, I'll let you ask that. Florida is a tremendous part of our business. We're in nearly every major housing market there save Miami. A big part of our business there tends to be focused on move-up and age targeted. We have some entry-level business in our Tampa and Orlando businesses, but the other big markets are predominantly move-up and age targeted. We get a little bit of move-up in Jacksonville as well--or a little bit of entry-level on Jacksonville as well, so. Really strong business, a lot of job relocation there, a lot of folks that want to be there because they've got flexible work arrangements that allow them to work from home or work from elsewhere. The headwinds in Florida are definitely affordability - we've seen strong price appreciation in most Florida markets, and then the other headwind that you've got there is around property taxes and insurance. Certainly those things kind of play into that, but Florida continues to be a big part of our business and a real bright spot for our business as well."
